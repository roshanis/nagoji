# Book II, Chapter 12: Threads of Alliance

Court in Travancore did not look like court in Pune.

There was no raised throne with a carved canopy, no line of sardars in embroidered coats jostling for the place closest to the royal ear. Instead, the king sat on a low platform in a long hall open on one side to the breeze. Mats covered the floor. Men and women sat in clusters rather than neat ranks, their positions telling you as much as their clothes.

From my place near one of the wooden pillars, I could see almost everything.

On the king's right sat Ramayyan, leaf bundles stacked neatly before him, stylus resting lightly in his hand. His eyes moved constantly. He seemed to be listening to three conversations at once, some spoken aloud, some in glances.

On the king's left, a space had been cleared.

That was where the Dutch would sit.

They entered with the heavy formality of men who had been told to be polite to people they considered their inferiors.

Two of them wore coats of dark cloth, cut tight at the waist, with rows of brass buttons that gleamed in the lamplight. Lace showed at their cuffs. Their hair was tied back, some grey streaks showing at the temples. Behind them walked younger men with ledgers and a single interpreter, a man of mixed features whose eyes slid everywhere and settled nowhere.

They carried hats under their arms, respectfully bareheaded within the hall.

“Maharaja,” the older of the two said in Portuguese, bowing slightly. The interpreter turned the words into Malayalam with smooth precision. “The Honourable Company brings greetings and hopes for continued friendship.”

Marthanda Varma inclined his head. He wore no crown, only a simple cloth over his shoulder and a string of rudraksha beads at his neck.

“You bring ships that sit like crows on our water,” he said. “Is that how your company shows friendship”

The interpreter blinked, taken aback by the directness. He recovered and translated. The Dutch envoy's mouth tightened very slightly.

“Our ships patrol the coast to protect trade,” he said. “There are pirates. There are rival companies. The seas are not as peaceful as we would like.”

“Nor is the land,” the king said. “Yet you do not see my horse standing in your streets in Batavia.”

There was a ripple in the hall. A few local chiefs smiled behind their hands. Padmini Amma, seated not far from the front, her stick across her knees, allowed the barest hint of amusement to show in her eyes.

Revathi Bayi sat farther back, surrounded by older women from Velinadu and a few younger relatives. She wore a deep green sari this time, her jewellery more subdued than at our first meeting. Her gaze, however, remained as sharp as a drawn blade.

The Dutch envoy spread his hands.

“We regret if our presence has caused concern,” he said. “Our intention is only to ensure that the pepper and other goods we pay for reach our ships unmolested. We also wish to reaffirm our treaties with the important houses of this coast.”

His eyes flicked toward the cluster of Velinadu women, then to Padmini Amma. He knew enough to know where land lay.

Ramayyan's stylus moved, marking that glance.

“Treaties are like nets,” Padmini had said to me once. “People remember when they are cast. They forget who pulls them tight.”

Now I watched to see whose muscles twitched.

“Our treaties stand,” Revathi Bayi said suddenly, in clear Portuguese that needed no interpreter. The room shifted its attention to her as easily as if someone had moved a lamp. “They say that the company respects Velinadu's rights and that Velinadu respects the company's trade. They say nothing of the company telling my kin in Travancore how many muskets to buy or whom to marry.”

The Dutch envoy looked faintly surprised to be addressed directly by a woman. His eyes widened a fraction more when he realised she spoke his language.

“Princess,” he said, inclining his head more deeply than he had for some of the chiefs. “We know the history of your line. We come with renewed respect.”

“Respect is shown in actions, not words,” she replied. “Last time your company men came to Velinadu with arrogance, many of them fed the earth. We have not forgotten. I doubt their widows have either.”

One of the younger Dutchmen shifted uncomfortably.

“The events you mention were unfortunate,” the envoy said. “They belonged to another time, another management.”

“Our memories do not change when your clerk's handwriting does,” she said.

Marthanda Varma let the exchange breathe for a moment, then lifted his hand.

“We are not here to relive old mistakes,” he said. “We are here to see whether new ones can be avoided.”

He gestured, and the hall's attention turned toward a group of men seated a little way off.

Local chiefs, each wearing their pride in different shapes. One had his hair tied back with a carved wooden stick, a sign of some minor title. Another wore layers of gold chains that looked more like debt than wealth. A third sat very straight, his clothes plain, his hands unadorned, the mark of someone who trusted his own land more than ornaments.

“You have lands that lie between my forts and the company's warehouses,” the king said to them. “You send pepper and men to both of us. You owe tax to my throne and promises to Velinadu and oaths to the Dutch. That is a great many directions for your heads to bow.”

There was nervous laughter.

“The Maharaja speaks truth,” one chief said, choosing boldness. “We are pulled like rope in a tug of war. We wish only that the rope not break.”

“Rope breaks when it is worn or rotten,” Ramayyan said softly. “We are trying to strengthen it. The question is whether you prefer to be tied to a king who lives among you or to a company whose masters sit beyond the sea.”

The Dutch envoy's face remained carefully neutral, but his interpreter swallowed.

I watched the chiefs' eyes. Some darted toward the Dutch, some toward the king, some toward the floor. One man's gaze flicked, just once, toward Ibrahim in the back of the hall. Ramayyan's stylus noted that too.

"The company brings guns and coins," one of the chiefs said. "They pay fair weight for pepper—twelve *varahans* the *candi*, in good gold pagodas."

The chief in plain clothes, the one who trusted his land more than ornaments, shifted slightly. "What of Kottarakkara?" he asked. "The Elayadathu chief still receives Dutch factors. His sister's daughter writes to Velinadu. There are whispers."

The name dropped into the hall like a stone into still water.

I watched the ripples.

Marthanda Varma's jaw tightened, a small movement, quickly controlled. Ramayyan's stylus stopped mid-stroke. Padmini's fingers curled around her stick until her knuckles paled. And Revathi, beside her, went utterly still, her face a mask that told me nothing and everything.

No one spoke for three heartbeats.

"Kottarakkara," the king said finally, his voice carefully even, "will be addressed in its time. We are not here to discuss houses that have not yet learned to count."

The plain-clothed chief lowered his eyes. He had asked a question he already knew the answer to. He had wanted to see who flinched.

I filed the name away. Kottarakkara. Elayadathu. Revathi's stillness. The king's jaw. Something lived in those syllables that I did not yet understand.

"Fair weight," Padmini murmured, as if the interruption had not happened, though her voice was tighter now. "And then they sell that pepper at three times the price elsewhere. Ask them what is fair."

Revathi's lips did not twitch this time. Her eyes remained fixed on some point beyond the Dutch envoy's shoulder.

“We do not deny the company's role in trade,” Marthanda Varma said. “But let no one here be confused. This land is not theirs. The roads are not theirs. The fields are not theirs. The men who die when guns fire are not theirs.”

He turned back to the Dutch envoy.

“You wish to reaffirm treaties,” he said. “Let us speak plainly. You will have your pepper. You will pay for it. You will not build new forts on this coast without my consent. You will not arm my enemies. In return, you will find your ships supplied, your merchants safe from bandits who think Europeans make sound targets.”

“And if we refuse?” the envoy asked.

Silence fell. Even the breeze seemed to pause at the edge of the hall.

Ramayyan's gaze slid to me for a fraction of a heartbeat, then back to the map of faces.

“Then you test our patience,” Marthanda Varma said. “And our sand.”

The words were simple. The weight behind them was not.

I thought of the drills on the shore, of horses learning to move in wet sand, of matchlocks cracking over the surf. I thought of the boy in the palm top lookout, counting Dutch hulls.

The envoy must have thought of those things too, or of reports that had reached him. His jaw shifted. Some calculation moved behind his eyes.

“We will convey your words to our superiors,” he said. “In the meantime, we propose a written agreement, signed by you, the Velinadu house, and the leading landholders, so that all parties understand their obligations.”

Revathi lifted her chin.

“We will read every line,” she said. “Twice.”

“And we will draft some of our own,” Ramayyan added. “Our scribes are not as slow as you may think.”

The rest of the afternoon passed in the rhythms of negotiation.

Words like “mutual defence” and “exclusive rights” and “tariffs” floated in the air, in Portuguese, in Malayalam, in Tamil the interpreter shifted to when he needed to make sense to more ears. Ramayyan guided the flow like a patient river pilot, steering around rocks, nudging here, redirecting there.

I listened, and I watched.

Watched which chiefs spoke and which stayed silent. Watched when Padmini's fingers tapped her stick and when they curled tight around it. Watched when Revathi's nostrils flared at a phrase. Watched the way the Dutch envoy's younger assistants whispered into his ear when some term troubled them.

At one point, during a break in the talk, Revathi moved along the edge of the crowd until she stood near me.

“You have been very quiet, Sawant,” she said in Konkani. “Does all this talk bore a man who prefers the noise of hooves?”

“On the contrary,” I said. “I am learning how many ways there are to start wars without lifting a sword.”

She gave a short, pleased hum.

“Good,” she said. “If you are to serve here, you must learn to hear when a word carries the weight of a musket. Otherwise you will charge at the wrong time.”

Her gaze swept the hall.

“See that man,” she said, tilting her head toward one of the plainer dressed chiefs. “Two years ago he took Dutch coin to rebuild his flooded fields—a *hundi* drawn on the Cochin factory, payable in pepper at harvest. Today he speaks loudly about loyalty to the Maharaja. He is not lying. He has simply forgotten that the company expects their coin back with interest. When they come to collect, I wonder whose banner he will stand under.”

“And you?” I asked. “Under whose banner will you stand when the king and the company pull in different directions?”

She looked at me as if I had asked whether the sea preferred high or low tide.

“I stand under Velinadu's,” she said. “The others move around us and hope we do not notice when they step on our toes.”

Padmini joined us, her eyes still on the front.

“You see the threads,” she murmured. “Now imagine them pulled tighter, with smoke and cannon added. That is what we head toward.”

Before I could answer, a boy in the king's livery appeared at Ramayyan's elbow. The Dalawa listened to a whispered word, then crooked a finger at me.

“Come,” he said. “There is someone you should meet who knows the Dutch from inside their own walls.”

He led me out of the main hall, down a side passage that smelled of limewash and oil, into a smaller room open on one side to a narrow courtyard. A single man sat there on a low stool, a clay cup of water untouched at his feet.

He was pale, even under the southern sun, with a yellowish cast that spoke of old sickness. His hair, cropped short, showed threads of grey though he could not have been much older than me. A rough cotton shirt and dhoti hung awkwardly on a frame accustomed to other cloth.

“This is Karl August,” Ramayyan said in Hindustani for my benefit. “He once wore the company's blue coat. Now he wears ours, when he wears anything at all.”

The man rose, a little stiffly, and inclined his head.

“I fought for the Dutch,” he said in halting Hindustani, his accent thick, the consonants hard. “They did not pay. They did not feed. They left us to rot in mud and fever. I decided I preferred to rot on my own terms.”

Ramayyan spread a fresh palm leaf on the floor between us. Karl August knelt and began to draw with a stick of charcoal.

“Here,” he said, sketching a curve that I recognised as the line of the coast. “Colachel. Sand. Here, mud fort, half fallen already under the weight of your enemy's guns.” He marked a small square and shaded one corner. “Powder. Rice. Too close. They keep them together to watch both, and because they fear the damp.”

He drew a second mark offshore.

“Here, Kanyakumari camp,” he said. “Men sick. Smallpox. No pay. They hate their officers more than you do.”

Ramayyan watched the shapes with the calm of a man fitting new pieces into a puzzle he already almost understood.

“We will not win this war with bravery alone,” he said quietly. “We will win it with men who know where the enemy keeps his fire and his food.”

By the time the Dutch withdrew, the light slanted low. They bowed, promised to return with draft papers, and left behind a faint trail of foreign scent, a mixture of spice and sweat and some sharp alcohol.

As they walked out, their interpreter a Portuguese factor, glanced at me, quick and curious. In that moment I saw what I must have looked like to him.

A foreigner in this hall, yet not European. A man in simple cotton, with scars on his hands, listening more than he spoke. A piece on the board whose shape he had not yet accounted for.

Good.

Let them wonder.

After the envoys had gone, the hall emptied slowly. Chiefs drifted toward Padmini and Revathi like small boats toward bigger hulls, each wanting to be seen, to be remembered, to share his worries and hopes.

Ramayyan sat with his palm leaves, adding a last few lines.

“You will ride tomorrow,” he said to me as I came forward. “Not to fight. To be seen. The Dutch must believe our horse can appear where they do not expect. Our own chiefs must remember that those hooves can cross their fields if they forget their promises.”

“A parade,” I said.

“A reminder,” he corrected.

He looked up from his palm leaves, his expression thoughtful. “The Dutch left angry today. They know the King is shifting the peppercorn trade away from them.”

“Shifting it where?” I asked.

“To the Syrian Christians,” he said, gesturing vaguely toward the north where Mathoo Tharakan's people held sway. “Tharakan and his kin. The King trusts them. They are of this soil, even if their god came from across the water. They build the warehouses, they move the grain, they keep the coin within the kingdom.”

“And the other chiefs?”

“They grumble,” Ramayyan said. “Houses like Elayadathu prefer the Portuguese or the Dutch. They think white skin means heavier gold. They do not see that the foreign hand takes two coins for every one it gives.”

I frowned. “Why does the King not give the trade to his own kind? Why must it be Christians or foreigners? Are there no Hindu merchants?”

Ramayyan smiled, a dry, thin curing of his lips. “You are from the Deccan, Sawant. You forget our laws here. For a Hindu of good caste to cross the black water is to lose his caste. The ocean is *kalapani* forbidden water. We can farm the pepper, we can tax the pepper, but we cannot sail with it to the markets of Arabia or Rome. That sin, we leave to others.”

He tapped his stylus against the leaf. “So we use the hands that are free to move. The Syrians. The Muslims. The King binds them to him so that when the ships sail, the profit returns to Padmanabhapuram, not Lisbon or Amsterdam.”

“And the English?” I asked. “They sit at Anchuthengu and watch the same sea.”

Ramayyan's mouth twitched.

“They are not saints,” he said. “They lent us guns and silver when Chanda Sahib pushed from the south, not out of love for Travancore, but because they did not wish to see their factory swallowed by Madurai men.”

He picked up another leaf, its edge already dark with handling.

“A doctor there, Alexander Orme, put his own coin on the line,” he went on. “He advanced money so that the Maharaja could meet part of what Chanda Sahib demanded and keep his army moving. The English call it a loan. We call it buying time.”

“You trust him?” I asked.

“I trust his fear,” Ramayyan said. “He knows that if this kingdom falls, the next army that marches along this coast will not stop at Anchuthengu to ask about interest.”

Marthanda Varma had left already, melting away as quietly as he had sat, but his presence still hung over the mats.

As I stepped out into the evening, the sky above the fort glowed with the last of the sun. Far off, on the line where sea met sky, I could just make out the faintest silhouettes of masts.

Threads had been woven in that hall. Some would hold. Some would snap. Either way, the fabric of this coast had been pulled a little tighter.

Soon, it would be tested.
