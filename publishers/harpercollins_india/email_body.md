**About the Book:**

*Horse of the Servant* follows Nagoji Sawant, a Maratha cavalryman who survives Portuguese torture in Goa and a shipwreck in the Arabian Sea, only to wash ashore in the kingdom of Travancore. There he becomes entangled in the ambitions of King Marthanda Varma, whose military and political genius would defeat the Dutch East India Company at the Battle of Colachel (1741) and forge a southern empire.

The novel explores loyalty, belonging, and the personal cost of statecraft through the eyes of an outsider who must choose between his Maratha past and the new land that claims him.

**Word Count:** Approximately 120,000 words
**Genre:** Historical Fiction

This is the first instalment in a planned series, *Blood and Thrones*. The second book will follow Dharma Raja, Marthanda Varma's nephew and successor, as he faces Tipu Sultan's southward expansion and makes the fateful decision to seek British alliance.
