Dear Editor,

I am writing to submit my debut novel, *Horse of the Servant*, a work of historical fiction set in 18th-century South India. The complete manuscript runs approximately 120,000 words.

**The Book**

*Horse of the Servant* tells the story of Nagoji Sawant, a Maratha cavalryman who survives Portuguese torture in Goa and a shipwreck in the Arabian Sea, only to wash ashore in the kingdom of Travancore. There he is drawn into the service of Marthanda Varma, the ambitious king who would defeat the Dutch East India Company at the Battle of Colachel (1741) and forge a southern empire that remained unconquered until Indian independence.

The novel explores loyalty, belonging, and the personal cost of statecraft through the eyes of an outsider who must choose between his Maratha past and the new land that claims him. It culminates in the Thrippadidanam ceremony of 1750, when Marthanda Varma surrendered his kingdom to Lord Padmanabha, making the state untouchable by noble rebellion.

This is the first instalment in a planned series, *Blood and Thrones*, which will chronicle pivotal moments in South Indian history through individual lives caught in the machinery of empire-building. The second book will follow Dharma Raja, Marthanda Varma's nephew and successor, as he faces the terrifying southward expansion of Tipu Sultan and makes the fateful decision to seek British alliance, a choice that preserved the kingdom but planted the seeds of a different subjugation.

**Why Penguin India**

Penguin India has a distinguished record of publishing literary historical fiction that brings Indian history to life for contemporary readers. I believe *Horse of the Servant* would complement titles such as Amitav Ghosh's *Sea of Poppies* and Manu S. Pillai's works on Travancore history, offering a visceral, character-driven narrative grounded in rigorous historical research.

**About Me**

I am a software engineer who grew up between Kerala and Maharashtra, the two lands whose histories intertwine in this novel. The stories in these pages draw from memories shared by my father, grandparents, uncles, aunts, mother-in-law, and wife, woven together with historical research into a narrative that honours both family lore and the documented past.

Yours sincerely,
