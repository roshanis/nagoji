# Author Bio

## RV Menon

RV Menon is a software engineer who grew up between Kerala and Maharashtra, two lands whose histories intertwine in this novel. The stories in these pages draw from memories shared by his father, grandparents, uncles, aunts, mother-in-law, and wife, woven together with historical research into a narrative that honours both family lore and the documented past.

His work reflects a deep engagement with South Indian history, particularly the 18th-century transformation of the Malabar coast under rulers like Marthanda Varma of Travancore. He brings to his fiction the analytical rigour of his technical background alongside a storyteller's instinct for the human details that make history breathe.

*Horse of the Servant* is his first novel.
