### Author Statement

I wrote *Horse of the Servant* because the stories of South India deserve the same literary attention that North Indian history has received. The Battle of Colachel, when an Indian kingdom captured a European military commander and turned him into their own general, is one of the most remarkable episodes in colonial-era history, yet it remains largely unknown outside Kerala.

This novel honours both the documented historical record and the family stories I grew up hearing, stories of pepper traders and temple warriors, of women who held land and men who served kings, of a coast where every bargain was backed by steel.

I bring to this work not academic distance but personal investment. These are my people's stories. I have tried to tell them with the craft they deserve.
