# Book IV, Chapter 21: First Campaign for the Tiger

The northern marches smelled different from the coast.

Less salt, more dust. Less pepper, more smoke from small village fires. The wind carried the sharp scent of laterite and dry grass instead of wet sand. It felt closer to the Deccan than anything I had known in years, and yet the rhythm of the land was still Travancore's.

The houses here owed the king less by habit than by calculation.

Their fields fed both his forts and their own ambitions. Their men had fought under his banner when Dutch guns threatened, but they had not forgotten that, before Marthanda Varma's rise, they had answered to weaker crowns. Some resented the new walls that rose on their ridges. Some grumbled about the levies Ramayyan's scribes counted with such care.

It was among these hills that the first campaign of my new command began.

The trouble started, as such things often do, with a rumour.

“Kollamkara Raja is entertaining foreign visitors,” a Marakkar trader said as he warmed his hands on a cup of spiced buttermilk in the fort courtyard. “Men with pale faces and boxes of cloth. They come up the river at night.”

“Dutch?” I asked.

The trader shrugged.

“Their ships sit off the coast these days with papers instead of cannons,” he said. “But their smaller craft still wander. Company men do not forget how to look for gaps.”

Ramayyan's fingers tapped on his palm leaf when he heard.

“Kollamkara sits near Padmini's northern edge,” he said. “If he tilts too far toward Dutch coin, they will have a foothold behind our forts.”

Marthanda Varma looked at me.

“You wanted marches,” he said. “Here they are. Go and see whether this raja needs reminding who sharpens his sword.”

So we rode.

My new command was a mixed force.

Travancore Nair horse, lighter and quicker than Deccan cavalry, able to move through scrub and narrow paths. Arcot lancers, still a little disdainful of these inland tracks but proud of their spears. A core of Maratha riders from my own band, men who had chosen to stay in this southern service with me, their tongues and jokes still carrying the hills in them.

Behind us, on slower feet, marched a unit of musketeers and a small, mobile gun, meant more to remind the northern chiefs of the king's reach than to batter walls.

Padmini rode with us for the first day.

“My lands lie between you and his,” she said. “I would rather be there when your men look for grazing.”

Her presence did more than protect her fields.

Her stick and tongue kept certain chiefs honest.

When we stopped in the first village, a petty headman greeted us with the formalities due a royal officer, then tried to impress us with his grievances against Kollamkara.

“He takes more grain than the old agreements said,” the man complained. “He sends his men to collect 'roads tax' each season. We pay to use the paths our grandfathers cut.”

Padmini listened, then said, “You also sell pepper behind the king's back to men who come in small boats at night. Do not pretend only he stretches old lines.”

The headman flushed and fell silent.

In one village that lay between Padmini's lands and Kollamkara's hill, we rode into the middle of a temple festival.

It was not a grand thing like those I had heard of at Padmanabhapuram, but the scale did not blunt its power. Bright cloths had been tied between trees. Oil lamps flickered in niches along the outer wall. Drums and nadaswarams wound a tight melody through the air. Men and women circled the shrine with small clay lamps cupped in their hands, their faces lit from below like the carved figures on the gopuram.

We reined in at the edge of the crowd. No one scattered. They shifted to make space, eyes flicking to our swords and horses, then back to the small procession that wound out from the sanctum.

A group of girls carried a palanquin bearing a simple wooden image of the goddess, decked in fresh flowers. Behind them walked older women with brass plates of rice and turmeric, their steps measured. Padmini dismounted and joined them without a word, slipping into the line as if she had always been there. Men bowed their heads as she passed.

“War does not stop for this,” Kulkarni murmured.

“This does not stop for war either,” I said.

For a few breaths we were simply part of the circle. The lamps moved, the drums spoke, the smell of ghee and jasmine and sweat wrapped around us. Somewhere in that swirl, a boy bumped into Yusuf Marakkar, who had appeared near the food stalls, hand on a basket of sweet fried discs.

He steadied the child with an easy smile, then caught my eye and tipped his head, as if to say that business never slept, not even when gods walked. I did not know whether he had come to pay respect, to listen, or to see which chiefs showed their faces. Perhaps all three.

When the procession ended and the goddess returned to her place, Padmini came back to her horse, eyes brighter.

“Now we go remind men outside these walls that she is not the only one watching,” she said.

By the next morning, the air had thickened with a different kind of tension.

Scouts reported armed men moving near the forest edge. Smoke rose in thin columns from hidden camps. A runner brought word that a small convoy of Travancore grain, destined for the new fort, had been ambushed a few nights earlier. The attackers had left company cloth and coins on one of the bodies, either as payment or as a message.

“He wants us to know,” Kulkarni said as we examined the scene. “He is not hiding this. He wants the Maharaja to see Dutch colour in his quarrel.”

“That way, if we strike him, he can tell other chiefs that we did it at the Dutch's bidding,” I said. “And if we do not, he can tell the Dutch we fear their anger.”

We found Kollamkara's men first.

They waited for us in a narrow valley where the road dipped between two wooded slopes.

Not a full ambush.

That would have required more patience than they possessed. It was an assertion, not an attempt to kill us all.

A line of spearmen and archers across the path. Men on the slopes with muskets. Their banners fluttered in the hot breeze, bright cloth pinned to tall poles.

At their centre sat the raja.

He was a heavy man, flesh hanging a little over his belt, but his eyes were sharp. He wore gold in his ears and around his neck, and a sword at his hip that had seen use. He sat on a low stool placed deliberately in the centre of the road, as if daring us to ask him to move.

I rode forward with Kulkarni and a Nair captain at my side.

“Raja,” I said, inclining my head.

“Sawant,” he said. “We heard the Maharaja had given a Maratha his marches. Nice of him to send you to announce yourself.”

His tone walked the line between mockery and welcome.

“You block the king's road,” I said. “That is one way to greet his officer.”

“I block no one's road,” he said. “I sit on mine. If the king wishes to pass, his horse can step around me. There is plenty of ground in this valley.”

His men chuckled.

“And if Dutch coin passes along this road at night?” I asked. “Does that belong to you as well?”

His eyes narrowed fractionally.

“Dutch coin spends in our markets,” he said. “As does Marakkar coin. As does Brahmin coin. The grain you send north does not ask whose hand dropped the money it buys. Why should I”

Kulkarni shifted his weight beside me, ready for the argument to turn sharper.

I lifted a hand slightly.

“The king does not object to trade,” I said. “He objects to men using foreign guns to settle local quarrels.”

I gestured at the assembled force.

“Travancore men lie dead on that road you raided,” I said. “Their powder has company smell on it. That is not trade. That is provocation.”

For a moment, something like guilt flickered in his gaze.

Then pride smothered it.

“They took more than their due,” he said. “The new walls demand more from us than the old ones did. If the king wants to tighten his hand, he should expect us to wriggle.”

“If you wriggle into Dutch arms, do not be surprised when their grip leaves marks,” I said. “We have seen what their embrace feels like.”

His jaw clenched.

“You come here with horse and muskets and speak as if we are children,” he said. “You forget that my men bled at Colachel too. When the Dutch fell, they did not ask whether the spear in their gut belonged to a Travancore Nair or a Kollamkara one.”

He was not wrong.

Many of these men had fought under the same sky on that beach. They now stood, not exactly opposite us, but at an angle that could become sharp quickly.

“We do not forget,” I said. “Which is why the king sent me to talk before cannons. But talk has its limits.”

I glanced at the slopes.

His men watched us, shifting their weight, fingers near trigger guards.

“You know what Dutch do when they see men with muskets blocking their road,” I said. “They fire, then argue later. We are giving you the courtesy of argument first. Do not mistake it for fear.”

He looked past me at the line of Travancore musketeers behind, at the small gun, at Padmini's banner among our horse.

When he saw Padmini herself, sitting her horse under a nearby tree, face unreadable, his shoulders tightened.

“If you fight them, you fight me,” she had told him years ago over a dispute about canal water. “When you come to their aid, you spill your blood on my soil. Do not forget whose ground you stand on.”

He glanced now at the stretch of land where our two domains brushed.

“What do you want, Sawant” he asked.

“Your men off the road,” I said. “Your promise that you will not use Dutch muskets on Travancore caravans. And your agreement that if company men come again, they do so as merchants, not as your private army.”

“And what does the king give” he asked tightly.

“The same thing he gave at Colachel,” I said. “Proof that when Dutch turn from coins to guns, they find more sand in their mouths than pepper.”

For a heartbeat, the valley held its breath.

Then he snorted and pushed himself up from his stool.

“You speak well for a man from the hills,” he said. “Too well. It makes me suspect you have Ramayyan's ink on your tongue.”

“I have my own words,” I said. “He just helps me keep track of where they land.”

He waved his hand.

“Stand aside,” he told his men. “Let the king's horse pass. Only fools stand in front of a cannon to prove a point.”

The line parted, slowly.

It felt less like victory than like being allowed to step over a tripwire that could be reset behind us.

As we rode past, Kulkarni leaned toward me.

“That was not the last of him,” he murmured.

“No,” I said. “But it is not today.”

We did not have to wait long for today.

Two weeks later, while we were still establishing our new patrol patterns and visiting smaller chiefs, smoke rose from near Padmini's northern fields.

Not cook smoke. Not temple lamps. Thick, black columns that meant burning.

By the time we reached the ridge above, the raiders were already withdrawing.

They had hit a narrow strip of pepper gardens along a canal, torching vines, cutting support poles, trampling the soil. A few of Padmini's men lay dead near the path, their bodies hacked, not shot. The raiders moved with the easy familiarity of men who knew every bend of the land.

Kollamkara's men. Wearing no company colours, carrying no Dutch muskets, but the message was clear enough.

You do not frighten me with your cannon.

“He could not strike at the king,” Padmini said, her voice shaking with restrained fury. “So he struck at me instead. He thinks you will hesitate to chase him into his own scrub.”

He was wrong.

We rode hard.

The chase that followed was not like Colachel.

No neat lines. No open beach. No clear horizon.

We galloped along narrow tracks between laterite outcrops, branches whipping at our faces. We splashed through shallow streams, hooves slipping on mossy stones. We crashed through patches of scrub, ducking low to avoid branches.

Kollamkara's riders knew the breaks in the land where they could vanish. We had to force them to show us.

At one bend, they tried an ambush.

Half a dozen men burst from cover ahead, firing muskets at close range. Another group loosed arrows from a side thicket.

The first volley caught two of our horsemen. One fell backwards, hands clutching at a spreading dark on his chest. The other pitched sideways, his foot tangled in his stirrup, his horse dragging him for several yards before Kulkarni cut the strap and hauled him clear.

We did not stop.

I drove my horse straight at the nearest shooter, my sword out.

His eyes widened as he realised his musket had not had time to reload. He dropped it and reached for a sword.

Too slow.

My blade caught his arm, biting through cloth and flesh. He yelled, stumbling back. My horse's shoulder slammed into his chest, knocking him aside.

Kumaran and his Nair riders swept into the flank of the ambush, their lighter mounts darting between trees. Spears flashed. The raiders, seeing their first strike fail, disappeared back into the scrub.

We did not follow deep. That was their terrain. Instead, we pressed along the main path, forcing their main body to keep moving.

By late afternoon, we had pushed them toward a shallow valley choked with low thorn bushes and rocky outcrops.

The kind of place where a careless commander could lose half his men in a few breaths.

We reined in on a ridge, horses blowing hard.

“If we go in there blind, we will bleed for every shrub,” Kulkarni said.

“He chose this ground for that,” Padmini said. She had insisted on coming, riding near the rear of our column, eyes flinty. “He thinks you will either rush in and lose men or pull back and let him claim he held you.”

I looked at the valley.

At the patterns of shadow and light. At the possible lines of retreat. At the rocks that could hide men with muskets.

“We do neither,” I said.

I signalled for the small gun we had brought.

Not a great battering piece like those that sat in the coastal forts. A lighter cannon, meant to be moved quickly, its crew used to dragging it over uneven ground.

We positioned it on the ridge, pointed not at a wall, but at the thickest stand of scrub where the raiders' trail vanished.

“We do not need to kill them all,” I said to the gun captain. “Just remind them that this terrain does not belong only to them.”

He nodded, sighted, and fired.

The cannon's roar echoed off the hills, startling birds from the trees. The ball tore through scrub and rock. Men shouted from below, some in pain, some in anger.

We fired twice more, adjusting slightly each time.

The cannon could not kill a whole band hidden in such cover. It could tear holes in their confidence.

“Now,” I said.

We sent in small groups on foot, Nairs moving with the cautious grace of men who knew knives waited under leaves. Arcot men followed, less familiar with such fighting but eager to prove themselves.

I went on foot with them.

Sometimes, horse is a hindrance.

The valley swallowed us.

Thorns caught at cloth and skin. Stones shifted underfoot. The air felt closer, humid with the exhalations of hidden bodies.

A man lunged at me from behind a bush, spear low. I twisted, letting the point slide past my hip, and drove my elbow into his jaw. His head snapped back. My hand found his wrist, twisted, and drove his own weapon into the ground.

A musket went off behind me, deafening in the confined space. Leaves shredded. A branch splintered inches from my ear.

I dropped, rolling behind a rock, and came up with my talwar ready.

Shapes moved in the dappled light.

Friend and foe differentiated only by the angle of their blades and the curses they shouted.

Hand to hand, everything narrowed.

It became not about banners or treaties, but about the feel of another man's weight against your arm, the angle of his wrist, the tension in his shoulder telegraphing where his next strike would come.

A raider grabbed my hair from behind.

Pain flared across my scalp. I felt his knife hand come up toward my throat.

I dropped my weight suddenly, letting my knees fold, my body falling. His grip slid, his balance shifted. I rolled, bringing my elbow up under his arm. There was a satisfying pop as something in his shoulder gave.

He screamed and let go.

I drove the pommel of my sword into his temple. He sagged.

Nearby, Kulkarni grappled with a man in a tight embrace, both of them slipping on loose stones, fists and knees and teeth all involved.

This was not the clean chaos of Colachel, with lines and volleys and charges. This was intimate, breath on your face, fingers in your flesh fighting.

By the time the sun slid toward the horizon, the valley had grown quieter.

The raiders broke.

Some fled toward Kollamkara's main fort. Others melted deeper into the hills. We did not chase into unknown ravines. We had made our point.

Back at the ridge, Padmini stood with the gun crew, eyes scanning the valley.

“Not as tidy as a treaty,” she said when we rejoined her. Blood smeared my sleeve. A cut stung along my cheek. Dust and sweat mingled on all our faces.

“Treaties did not stop him,” I said. “He used Dutch coin to test the king. We answered with our own thunder.”

“He will complain,” she said. “He will say you scorched land that feeds his people.”

“I burned scrub he used as cover,” I said. “His people can plant millet there now if they wish.”

She gave a short laugh.

“You sound like Ramayyan,” she said. “Always trying to make numbers out of blood.”

“Blood is a number,” I said softly. “On every side.”

When we returned to the fort weeks later, report written, Ramayyan read it in silence.

“You did not take his fort,” he said.

“That was not the king's order,” I replied. “We reminded him of the cost of playing with Dutch shadows. We cut his raiders. We did not start a war that would burn half the marches.”

Marthanda Varma nodded.

“Good,” he said. “We have enough fronts without adding more.”

He tapped the report.

“Remember this valley,” he said. “We may need it again, with different men in the bushes.”

Padmini, when she read her own copy, snorted.

“You burned my weeds,” she said. “I suppose that is something.”

“Your pepper was untouched,” I said.

“For now,” she replied. “Do not get used to that.”

Revathi, when she heard, was less forgiving.

“You used cannon on men who once marched with you at Colachel,” she said. “You burned land that feeds houses older than your king's line.”

“I used small guns and sharp blades to stop a man from building a private company fort in the hills,” I said. “If I had done nothing, you would have scolded me for letting Dutch shadows grow behind your back.”

She considered that, then shook her head.

“You chose as you always will,” she said. “The king first. The houses later.”

She was not entirely wrong.

The first campaign for the Tiger had shown me that the dangers on these marches were not only foreign flags and company men. They were pride, old grudges, and the temptation of outsiders' coins.

As I walked along the fort wall that night, listening to the owls and distant dogs, shoulder still sore from the valley's fights, I realised that my work here would rarely be as clear as Colachel.

The enemies would not always wear neat coats and march in straight lines.

Sometimes they would come wrapped in familiar cloth, speaking old names and praying at the same shrines.

That was a harder battle.

But it was the one I had ridden north to fight.
