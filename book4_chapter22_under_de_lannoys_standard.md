# Book IV, Chapter 22: Under De Lannoy's Standard

By the time the first dry season after Kollamkara's valley campaign came and went, people in the fort had started calling one of the new bastions “the foreigner's tooth.”

They said it half in jest, half in grudging respect.

From that bastion, De Lannoy and I watched a unit of cavalry and infantry move through a combined drill that would have made both my younger self and his former company captains splutter.

Nair horse trotted along the base of the wall, then wheeled, moving in pairs between marked posts. Behind them, musketeers lowered their weapons in controlled waves, firing over the horses' backs at imaginary targets in the scrub beyond. At intervals, a small cannon boomed, its recoil checked by well braced wheels.

The air smelled of burned powder, sweat and laterite dust.

“They are improving,” Lannoy said, shading his eyes with one hand as he watched.

“You sound almost pleased,” I said.

“Almost,” he agreed.

We stood under a banner that combined our worlds.

The king's emblem flew at the top of the staff, but below it hung a smaller pennant bearing a simple design Lannoy had drawn himself: a diagonal line, representing the fort wall, crossed by a curved one, representing horse movement.

“If you insist on naming bastions after me,” he had said when he first heard the soldiers muttering “foreigner's tooth,” “I insist on at least choosing a decent symbol.”

I had shrugged.

“Better a tooth than a sore,” I had said. “At least this one bites outward.”

Not everyone liked how sharp that bite was becoming.

In court, whispers had grown.

“The Deccan rider and the Dutch captain,” one chief said once, loud enough for the words to travel. “Two foreigners teaching us how to use our own land.”

“Teaching us how to keep it,” Padmini had replied. “If you prefer to learn from men who have never seen a European musket up close, that is your choice. Do not complain when your sons bleed for it.”

Still, the resentment was there.

We felt it in the way some chiefs delayed sending men for drills, citing weather or harvests. We heard it in the sharper questions posed in the hall when Ramayyan suggested new levy structures. We saw it in the tightened mouths of certain officers when the king listened more closely to Lannoy's fortification advice than to theirs.

“We must not become a separate standard,” Lannoy said to me one evening as we walked along the rampart. “If they see us as a force within a force, we will be cut out like a tumour when the monarchy changes.”

“You think that will happen?” I asked.

He shrugged.

“In my land, kings fall,” he said. “In yours, too. We would be naive to think this court will look the same ten years from now.”

“We fight for the structure, then,” I said. “Not the man.”

“We fight so that whoever sits on that platform cannot easily undo what we have built without making himself vulnerable to men with better guns,” he said. “It is a selfish defence, in a way.”

“Selfish defence keeps people alive,” I said.

He laughed.

“There you go with your unpleasant truths again,” he said.

Our partnership had settled into a rough rhythm.

We still argued.

One week, about whether a particular outpost needed a full stone redoubt or a simpler earthwork.

“If you want it to last through a siege, stone,” he said.

“If you want it built before next monsoon, earth,” I replied.

Another week, about how many horses could be spared from patrols to participate in a large scale joint manoeuvre he wanted to stage for the king.

“If you pull too many from the marches to dance here, I will be blind there,” I said.

“If we never show the full pattern, the king will not understand what his army can do,” he countered.

Ramayyan often had to step in, not as judge, but as balancer.

“Half the stone now, earth for the rest, with the plan to add more later,” he would say. Or, “Two days' drill with a rotated horse list, so patrol gaps are brief.”

“You spend as much time keeping the two of us from killing each other as you do keeping the king alive,” I told him once.

“It is all the same work,” he replied. “Preventable deaths exhaust me.”

Our men, meanwhile, learned to see us not as two rival courts, but as two facets of the same demand.

On one hot afternoon, during a combined drill, a young Nair musketeer fired too early, his shot kicking up dust far from the wooden target.

“Again,” Lannoy barked, surprisingly fluent in Malayalam now.

The youth flinched, began to fumble with his powder horn.

“Breathe,” I called from my horse's back as I trotted past. “The gun does not fear your heartbeat. Make it go slower than the drum.”

Later, when the same recruit managed to fire in perfect time over the heads of passing cavalry, both of us nodded.

“Good,” Lannoy said.

“Now do it when someone is shouting in your ear,” I added.

The boy grinned, sweat dripping into his eyes.

“Yes, Kapitan, yes, Sawant,” he said.

He did not seem to care which of us got which title. We were both, to him, men who made his arms ache and his shoulders remember new positions.

It was in such small, shared approvals that our partnership took root.

Not in grand strategies, but in moments when a man who had once commanded Dutch lines on a beach and a man who had once raided Portuguese caravans in the Deccan both agreed that a recruit's stance was finally acceptable.

Outside the fort, the world did not stop.

Mysore's ambitions grew. Rumours of Hyder Ali floated south on traders' tongues. The Maratha confederacy continued to roil. British factors began to appear in ports further north, their languages different, their ledgers just as hungry.

“The Dutch are no longer the only storm,” Ibrahim said one evening over a cup of toddy. “Now there are others. They smell each other's gun smoke and circle.”

“We will need more than one tooth,” Padmini said. “And more than one kind of jaw.”

Court factions noticed that too.

Some saw advantage in aligning with the foreign trained arm of the army.

“If we stand with the king's modern forces,” one younger chief said to me, “we will have leverage when the next treaty is written. Our names will be among those he needs.”

Others took the opposite view.

“This new army eats coin,” an older noble grumbled to Padmini. “Our lands bleed grain to feed it. The Deccan rider and the Dutchman build a throne that may one day crush us all.”

Padmini had replied, “Better a throne whose legs you helped carve than one dropped whole from a ship's hull.”

Revathi watched from Velinadu with her usual layered gaze.

“You and De Lannoy are useful,” she said to me on one of my visits. “You are also convenient scapegoats.”

“Scapegoats?” I asked.

“If the army fails, they will say the foreigner misled it,” she said. “If it grows too strong, they will say the foreigner twisted it. Either way, men who resent change will blame you rather than their own laziness.” Her gaze drifted toward the foreigner's tooth. “If a wall ever falls, I would rather it land on the Dutchman who designed it than on my people,” she added once, without a smile.

“You make the future sound bleak,” I said.

“I make it sound like what it often is,” she replied. “Complicated.”

One evening, after a particularly long day of drills and disputes, Lannoy and I ended up in the fort's small armoury, checking a new shipment of blades.

He picked up a talwar, feeling its weight.

“Your swords are better for cutting from horseback,” he said. “Our straight blades are better for thrusts on foot.”

“We make do with what the land asks,” I said. “If the ground is cluttered, curve your steel.”

He tested the edge with his thumb, then flipped the sword, offering it hilt first.

“If we are to be blamed together, we may as well be armed together,” he said.

I took the blade.

“You have accepted that you will never go back,” I said.

He leaned against a rack of spears, staring at some point between us.

“Back where” he asked. “To ships that would call me traitor To a land that has already written my name in a different ledger”

He shook his head.

“This is my fort now,” he said. “These are my men. If I spend the rest of my life trying to make sure they do not die as stupidly as some of my countrymen did, perhaps that will be enough to balance a few lines.”

His words echoed my own thoughts more than he knew.

We stood there in silence for a few breaths, two men far from the places that had birthed us, bound to a banner that was neither of our first choosing, yet had become ours by repeated, bloody decisions.

“Under whose standard do we truly stand, Nagoji Sawant?” he asked softly. “The king's The idea of this place The memory of the men who died at Colachel”

“All of them,” I said. “On different days.”

He nodded.

“On the days when it is the king's,” he said, “we must be careful. Kings change. Places endure longer.”

“You have been talking to Revathi,” I said.

He smiled.

“She scolds me too,” he said. “Apparently my foreignness does not exempt me.”

We left the armoury and stepped out onto the wall.

Below, under the foreigner's tooth, men still drilled in the waning light.

Travancore men, moving in patterns that had never existed on this coast before European hulls, Deccan riders and Dutch captains all smashed into it.

Whatever names future scribes gave this army, for this moment, it was ours.

We stood under its standard.

Together.
