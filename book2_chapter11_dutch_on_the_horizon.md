# Book II, Chapter 11: Dutch on the Horizon

The first time I heard De Lannoy's name, it came not in a court, but from a boy on a watch tower.

He was perhaps fifteen, lanky in the way youths are when their bones grow faster than their muscles. He stood on a wooden platform lashed to the top of a coconut palm on a headland, a long glass tube held to his eye. The sea wind tugged at his hair and his threadbare cloth.

“Three ships,” he called in Malayalam as I rode up the sandy path under the midday sun. “No, four. The new one is smaller. They fly the same colours.”

The guard at the base of the tree looked up.

“The banded flag” he shouted.

“Yes,” the boy said. “Red, white, blue.”

The guard turned to me.

“Company ships,” he said in Hindustani. “Dutch.”

We were on a finger of land that jutted out into the sea, one of several such points along the coast where Marakkars and Nair guardians had built rough lookouts. From here, on a clear day, you could watch ships move along the horizon like beads on a string.

Today, the string was busier than usual.

I shaded my eyes and squinted out to sea. At first, all I saw were tiny specks of white against the blue. Slowly, my Deccan eyes, more accustomed to reading slopes and dust trails, began to make sense of the new shapes.

Four hulls, three large, one smaller, sails full, moving in slow procession along the line where sky met water.

“They are closer than yesterday,” the boy called.

“You have seen them before?” I asked.

He grinned down at me.

“They come and go,” he said. “Sometimes they sit like lazy crocodiles for days. Sometimes they hurry past as if chased by gods. These ones move like men who know where they are going.”

“And who leads them?” I asked.

The boy lowered the glass for a moment and wiped his sweating palm on his cloth.

“The same tall captain,” he said. “The one with the pale hair and the stick he uses to beat his men into straight lines.”

The guard at the base snorted.

“He means the Dutch officer,” he said. “The one their traders whisper about. The one who drills them until they piss in step.”

“He stands on the quarterdeck, always in the same place,” the boy went on. “Hands behind his back. When he turns, the men move. When he scratches his nose, they move slower.”

There was admiration in his voice, grudging but genuine. Even enemy discipline has its own pull for young eyes.

“He has a name?” I asked.

The boy frowned.

“They shout something,” he said. “Hard to hear over the wind. Lannoy. Lannu. Something like that.”

It was the first time the sound of that name pricked my ears.

“Keep watching,” I said. “Count how many days they hover. Count how close they dare come. The sea tells us things if we listen.”

As we rode back toward the coastal hall, Ibrahim shook his head.

“They smell blood,” he said. “Or pepper. To them it is the same.”

“They smell a king who does not kneel easily,” I said.

“That too,” he agreed.

In the war hall, the air was thick with the smell of ink and sweat.

Maps lay unrolled across the floor, held down by stones and spear shafts. Pebbles and shells marked ships, forts, hills, villages. Ramayyan crouched over one of these maps, his thin fingers moving tokens with the care of a priest placing offerings.

Marthanda Varma sat nearby, not on his platform but on the floor itself, cross legged, spear laid aside. His hair was bound back with a simple cloth. His upper body glistened with a sheen of heat; he had clearly been there for some time.

“Sawant,” he said without looking up as I entered. “Tell me.”

I crossed the room and knelt at the edge of the map.

“Four company ships,” I said. “Three large, one smaller. Flying Dutch colours. Moving south along the line. The watch boy says the same tall officer stands on the quarterdeck. He calls him Lannoy, though the wind may have changed the name.”

Ramayyan's hand hovered above a small shell.

“Here,” he said, placing it off a headland he had marked with a charcoal smear. “If they hold that course and that speed.”

“They will anchor within sight of our coast by evening,” Ibrahim added, stepping forward. “Close enough to send boats ashore if they wish. Not close enough to risk your cannon, Maharaja.”

“They test us,” Marthanda Varma said. “They want to see how high we raise our hackles when they show their teeth.”

He looked up at me.

“What would your Peshwa do?” he asked. “If four foreign ships hovered off his coast like vultures”

In that moment, in my mind's eye, I saw Pune's court, its painted pillars and high seat, the scribes and sardars, the priests and petitioners. I imagined the news carried north, the murmurs, the measured outrage.

“He would send letters,” I said. “To his sardars, to the companies, to Delhi. He would demand explanations. He would threaten, but he would not move his own men until he had counted the cost twice. His coast is not as tightly bound to his capital as yours is. He can afford to pretend distance.”

“I cannot,” Marthanda Varma said. “If the Dutch piss in our waters, the smell reaches my throne the same day.”

Ramayyan's stylus scratched on a palm leaf.

“We know from our informants,” he said, “that these ships answer to the Zeeland chamber of the company. Their commander has been cautioned not to provoke open war, but has been told to remind local chiefs who controls trade. He will look for our weak points. He will test alliances.”

“He will land if he thinks he can do so without losing too many shoes,” Ibrahim said. “Boats to small ports. Gifts for those who fear you more than the company. Promises written in thick ink and broken in thin whispers.”

“What do they make of our sand drills” I asked. “Of our horse and muskets”

“They know some of it,” Ramayyan said. “Their merchants watch. Their petty captains talk. But they have not yet seen what you did on that shore when no one counted but the boy on the palm and the king under the awning.”

Marthanda Varma tapped the map with his finger.

“I want them to glimpse enough to worry,” he said. “Not enough to understand.”

He looked at me.

“You will take a small party of riders along the coast,” he said. “Move in sight of their ships, but out of cannon range. Let their glass see horse that do not fear the water's edge. Let them see dust where they expect to see only fishermen.”

“They will think we mean to charge the sea,” I said.

“Let them think many things,” he said. “Confusion is a useful ally. We will not fire first. We will not give them cause to say to Batavia and Amsterdam that the savage Travancore king attacked peaceful traders. But we will not lower our heads either.”

Ramayyan added softly, “And while you ride, our men on the backwaters will count how many boats the Dutch send toward which creeks. Our scribes in the markets will listen to which chiefs receive Dutch cloth and coins. Our temple men will note which sleeves carry new gold.”

The plan, such as it was, spread like ripples from a stone.

I left the hall with Ibrahim at my side, our heads already bent over the practicalities. Which horses. Which riders. How close we could come without inviting a stray shot. How to keep our men from spitting in the sand when they saw Dutch flags.

That evening, as the sky turned copper, we rode along the ridge above the beach.

The ships had moved closer, as predicted. Their hulls were now clear, dark against the pale water. I could see gunports like blind eyes along their sides, open, closed, open. Through Ibrahim's glass, passed briefly to me, I glimpsed tiny figures pacing decks, adjusting ropes, staring back.

On the quarterdeck of the largest ship, a man stood.

Even at this distance, his posture was distinct. Hands clasped behind his back. Feet planted apart, adjusting minutely with the roll of the ship. A hat shaded his face, but I could see the pale of his hair where it escaped.

The boy on the watch tower had not exaggerated. There was a kind of contained severity in the man's stance, the same quality I had seen in Deccan officers who lived for drill and order.

I lowered the glass, then raised it again, as if the second look might show me something the first had missed.

“He is just a man,” Ibrahim said quietly. “He will bleed like any other if you cut him.”

“I know,” I said. “But until I see him on land, it is hard not to think of him as part of the ship.”

“Then imagine him drowning,” Ibrahim said dryly. “That will help.”

We walked our horses along the ridge, taking care to keep our silhouettes visible. Below, on the beach, a handful of Nair riders trotted their mounts through the shallows, water splashing around their horses' legs. Farther inland, carts moved along the track with deliberate slowness, making it clear that life on this coast did not halt because European hulls hovered.

On the ship, tiny glass circles glinted in the last light as Dutch eyes watched us.

“The tall one will note that your riders do not panic when the waves reach their hooves,” Ibrahim said. “He will tell his superiors that you train horse for this coast. They will mark it in their letters. Somewhere, a man with a powdered wig will tap that line and frown.”

“Good,” I said. “Let his wig itch.”

When the sun dipped, we turned back toward the inland path. The sea darkened. Lanterns bloomed on the ships, small, steady stars that moved with the swell.

Later, long after the horses were stabled and the riders dismissed, I climbed the bluff alone.

The boy with the spyglass had gone. The watch was held by an older man who nodded and went back to his quiet pacing. I walked to the edge where scrub gave way to rock and sat, knees drawn up, arms resting on them.

In the darkness, the sea erased distances. The ships were now only clusters of lights, their masts invisible. They could have been fishing boats, or floating shrines, or ghosts.

I listened to the hiss of waves on the sand below, the occasional creak of branch, the distant boom of surf against some unseen rock.

Somewhere out there, on that largest hull, the pale haired officer, Lannoy, Lannu, whatever his men called him, stood or slept or paced. He had his own maps, his own Ramayyan whispering advice, his own king in a far city expecting profit and control.

We had not yet met. Our swords had not yet crossed. Our names were sounds on other men's tongues.

Yet already I could feel him in the shape of the air, in the tension of the men in the hall, in the way Marthanda Varma's fingers had tapped the map when he spoke of him.

In Goa, my enemies had been men I could see across a dungeon table, smell across a torture room. Here, some of the most dangerous ones hovered beyond sight, their decisions carried by water and sealed with wax hundreds of leagues away.

I pressed my palm against the rough rock beside me, feeling its solidity.

“Come closer,” I murmured to the lights offshore. “Come stand where I can reach you. Let us see how your neat lines fare when the ground shifts under you.”

The sea gave no answer. It rarely does.

But as I sat there, the breeze shifted slightly, bringing with it the faintest trace of unfamiliar smoke. Not coconut husk, not jackfruit wood, not the resin of local trees.

Ship smoke.

Dutch smoke.

The horizon had begun to move nearer, whether it wished to or not.
