# Chapter 8: The Sons of De Lannoy

The first time I saw Hendrik and Caspar together on the guns, I understood why men fear inheritance.

A father can build a wall and still leave cracks in the stones.

De Lannoy's sons were those cracks, and they were also the proof that the wall had been built at all.

---

De Lannoy called for a full drill at Udayagiri on a day when the sky was clear enough to tempt pride.

The monsoon had loosened its grip for a week. The air was still heavy, but the sun had teeth again. Heat rose off the stone walls and turned the gun yard into an oven. Powder dried quickly in that heat, which made gunners careless, because men always relax when conditions feel favourable.

De Lannoy did not relax.

He stood at the edge of the yard with a small sandglass in his hand, the kind merchants used to time bargains. He had stolen the object from trade and turned it into a weapon.

"We are too slow," he said in Malayalam, loud enough that every crew could hear. "In war you do not get extra time because you are sweating."

The crews muttered under their breath. Sweat ran down faces and darkened cloth. The guns sat in a row, cleaned and ready, their muzzles pointed toward the range where palm trunks and sand berms waited to be punched apart.

I stood beside De Lannoy, notebook in hand, pretending to be calm. I was not. When De Lannoy decided a drill was not good enough, men got hurt trying to satisfy him.

Then Margaret arrived with his sons.

She did not stand in the yard. Margaret was too practical to place herself near iron. She remained under the shade of the eaves, arms folded, eyes on her husband as if watching him was its own kind of duty.

Hendrik stepped into the yard first.

He was in his early twenties, tall and lean, with his father's straight-backed posture and his mother's dark eyes. His hair was tied neatly. His uniform was clean. He carried himself as if every movement had been rehearsed.

Caspar followed.

Caspar was younger by five years, and it showed in his mouth more than his body. He smiled too easily. He moved like a man who knew the rules and enjoyed walking close enough to their edge to make others nervous.

His uniform was also clean, but it looked as if he had dressed quickly, the belt not quite straight, the collar not quite aligned. A small thing, but De Lannoy noticed small things the way gunners notice a change in wind.

The boys on the crews stared. A commander's sons were always watched. Watched for favour, watched for weakness, watched for the chance to gossip.

De Lannoy did not acknowledge the attention.

"Hendrik," he said.

Hendrik stepped forward. "Yes, Father."

De Lannoy's eyes moved to Caspar. "Caspar."

"Yes, Father," Caspar replied, and there was humour in it, as if the word father amused him.

De Lannoy raised the sandglass. "Demonstrate."

Hendrik's face did not change. Caspar's smile widened.

They walked to a gun in the centre of the line, a field piece with a crew of six men waiting beside it.

Hendrik looked at the crew once. His gaze went to their hands, their tools, their stance. He adjusted the position of one man by touching his elbow and moving it a finger width inward.

The man obeyed, startled by the precision.

Caspar said nothing. He only picked up the rammer and spun it in his hands with casual confidence, as if the heavy wooden staff was a stick for a boy's game.

De Lannoy turned the sandglass and the grains began to fall.

"Load," Hendrik said.

The crew moved.

Sponge, the wet sheepskin head pushed down the barrel to extinguish embers. Powder charge, measured and poured. Wad, tamped. Shot, heavy in the hand. Wad again. The rammer thudded, once, twice, until the shot sat properly against the charge.

Hendrik watched the sequence with the cold attention of a man counting heartbeats.

Caspar watched too, but his attention was different. He looked less at the hands and more at the gun itself, the angle of the carriage, the slight tilt of the wheel in the dirt. He crouched and shoved a stone under the wheel to level it, a move no one had ordered.

Hendrik did not comment. He did not need to. His crew was already adjusting as if Caspar's instinct was part of the plan.

"Prime," Hendrik ordered.

A man opened the vent, pricked it, poured fine powder into the pan, closed the frizzen. Match held ready, eyes on Hendrik.

Hendrik lifted the quadrant, measured elevation, made a minute adjustment with the wedge.

Caspar leaned toward the muzzle and peered down the line of the barrel, as if he could see the target through heat shimmer.

Hendrik raised his hand.

The yard went quiet in that strange way it always did just before firing, as if men forget to breathe when iron is about to speak.

Hendrik dropped his hand.

The gun fired.

The blast hit my chest and made my ribs vibrate. Smoke rolled out and drifted on the faint wind from the sea. Somewhere downrange, a palm trunk jumped as the shot struck it.

Hendrik was already turning to the sandglass.

"Thirty-two seconds," he said, calm.

Some of the crew smiled, proud. Others looked afraid, because pride makes a man careless and De Lannoy punished carelessness.

Caspar spun the rammer again, grinning.

"We can do it in under thirty," he said.

Hendrik's eyes flicked to him. "Under thirty is meaningless if the shot goes wide."

Caspar shrugged. "Wide is meaningless if the enemy is close."

Hendrik's mouth tightened. "You speak as if war is a brawl."

Caspar's grin turned sharper. "Sometimes it is."

The crew, still holding tools, looked between them the way men watch a knife fight begin.

De Lannoy stepped forward.

He did not shout. He did not strike.

"Again," he said.

The word landed like a hammer.

The crew reset. Sponge, powder, wad, shot. The rhythm returned.

On the second loading, something went wrong.

It was small at first, so small that only trained eyes would catch it. The sponge came out of the barrel with a faint thread of smoke clinging to it, like a ghost.

An ember remained inside the gun.

If the next powder charge went in, the ember could ignite it before the wad was seated. A premature discharge could rip through the crew. It could turn the gun yard into meat and splinters.

The crew did not notice. They were already reaching for the powder.

Caspar noticed.

He moved without thinking, and his movement was faster than discipline.

He grabbed the powder charge out of the boy's hands and threw it into a bucket of water with a hiss. Then he seized the sponge staff and rammed it down the barrel again, hard, twisting, forcing the wet sheepskin to smother whatever heat remained.

"Idiots," he snapped in Malayalam. "You want to die to impress my father?"

The crew froze, shocked.

Hendrik stared at him. For a moment, the older brother's precision looked like paralysis.

De Lannoy's face did not change, but his eyes sharpened.

"Good," he said quietly.

He turned to the crew. "Do you see?"

The men nodded, chastened.

De Lannoy looked at Hendrik. "Discipline," he said.

Then he looked at Caspar. "Instinct."

He lifted the sandglass again. "You need both. A gun does not care which saved you. It only cares that you live long enough to load again."

The drill continued.

Hendrik regained his rhythm. His voice stayed calm. His hand signals were clean. Under his command, the crew moved like a single body.

Caspar stopped grinning.

When he worked, he worked with ferocity, as if the near disaster had reminded him that war is never a game for long.

At the end of the drill, the sandglass ran empty. The last grains settled.

De Lannoy nodded. "Better."

The word was praise from him, and it landed on the yard like rain after heat. Men exhaled. Tools were set down. Hands wiped sweat from eyes.

Hendrik turned to Caspar and said, quietly, "You should not have shouted."

Caspar's laugh was sharp. "And you should not have frozen."

Hendrik's jaw tightened. "I did not freeze. I assessed."

Caspar's eyes glittered. "Assessment is a fine thing. It does not stop fire."

For a moment I thought Hendrik would strike him.

Instead, Hendrik looked past him to their father.

De Lannoy was already walking away, as if the argument did not exist.

Hendrik's face softened by a fraction, something like defeat.

Caspar watched his brother's expression and his own mouth twisted, not quite a smile, not quite regret.

They followed their father in silence.

---

That evening, Margaret served dinner as if nothing had happened.

Her house was full of small acts of denial. A clean table. A lamp burning steadily. Rice and fish and coconut in bowls that were not chipped. A family eating together as if war was only a word spoken by men who wanted money.

Hendrik ate quietly, his posture perfect. Caspar ate too fast, as if he was still running from something.

Margaret watched them both with a mother's eyes, seeing cracks no one else wanted to see.

De Lannoy spoke of powder stores and carriage repairs. He spoke of the new king's orders. He spoke as if he could keep his sons safe by keeping the conversation technical.

It did not work. Nothing keeps men safe.

After the meal, Hendrik left to review range tables and crew assignments. That was his comfort, paper and order.

Caspar went outside and drank from a small flask he did not think his mother had noticed.

Margaret noticed everything.

She came to me when the men had scattered and the house had quieted.

"He is brave," she said, meaning Caspar.

"Yes," I replied.

Margaret's eyes narrowed. "Do not say it like an officer," she said. "Say it like a man who knows what bravery costs."

I felt my throat tighten, annoyed by my own helplessness.

"Caspar will die," I said, and hated myself for how calm it sounded.

Margaret did not flinch. She had been a factor's daughter. She had lived among men who traded lives the way they traded pepper.

"Perhaps," she said. "Or perhaps he will live and become bitter, which is sometimes worse."

She looked toward the doorway where Caspar stood in the yard, head tilted back, drinking as if he could swallow his own restlessness.

"He cannot live in peace," she said. "Hendrik lives for peace, for order. Caspar lives for the moment the gun speaks and the world narrows to one decision."

I thought of Colachel. Of the smoke. Of the moment the world narrowed to a line and a curve.

I understood Caspar more than I wanted to.

"And Hendrik?" I asked.

Margaret's mouth tightened. "Hendrik will inherit the guns," she said. "He will inherit his father's enemies, his father's obligations, his father's legend. He will spend his life trying to be worthy of a man who cannot be replaced."

She looked at me, suddenly sharp.

"And you," she said. "You will be between them."

I felt that sentence settle in my bones like an order.

Between them.

Between worlds.

Between faiths.

Between the Dutch boy who had died at Colachel and the Travancorean officer who stood on the wall and counted powder.

Margaret touched my sleeve, brief and light.

"Do not let them tear each other apart," she said. "If they do, their father will die before his body does."

That night, as I walked back to my house by the backwaters, I heard the fort's guns on the range, a steady thunder in the distance.

In the dark, Caspar's shout in the gun yard echoed in my head.

Idiots. You want to die to impress my father?

I thought of Willem asleep on his mat, the wooden horse De Lannoy had carved beside him.

I thought of the sons who would inherit the guns, whether they wanted to or not.

Inheritance is a weapon.

It can keep a kingdom standing.

It can also cut the hand that holds it.
