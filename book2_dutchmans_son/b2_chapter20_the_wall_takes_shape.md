# Chapter 20: The Wall Takes Shape

A wall is not stone.

Stone is what men see when they want to be comforted.

A wall is labour. It is mud dug by hands that blister. It is timber cut in rain. It is rice brought on time so the men digging do not walk away. It is officers who stay sober long enough to count. It is an argument between engineers about where a bastion should sit. It is a decision about which village will lose its trees so another village can keep its roof.

I learned that when the *Nedumkotta* began to take shape.

The Travancore Lines.

A line cut across the land like a scar.

---

The first time I rode north to see the work, it was still only a path through jungle.

Men had cleared brush and marked the intended line with stakes. A ditch had been started in one place, a shallow wound in the earth, and in another place a mound of soil had been piled and tamped by feet, an earthen lip that looked laughably small against the green world around it.

This, I thought, is what kingdoms trust.

Then I watched the labourers work.

They moved with the steady rhythm of people who have never been allowed the luxury of believing effort is optional. Men dug with spades and baskets. Women carried earth in loads balanced on cloth rings on their heads. Children brought water and ran messages.

Soldiers stood with spears, not because they expected the labourers to rebel, but because a wall needs protection even while it is being born.

The air smelled of wet leaves and sweat. Insects whined at the edges of hearing. Every few minutes someone slapped at a leech.

The work was slow.

It was also relentless.

That relentlessness was the true wall.

---

Raja Kesavadas met me at a temporary camp, a cluster of palm-leaf shelters and canvas tents raised on slightly higher ground to avoid the worst of the water.

He looked out over the cleared line with a face that belonged on a ledger. Calm. Assessing. Unimpressed by romance.

"De Lannoy cannot ride this far now," he said by way of greeting.

It was not criticism. It was a fact with weight.

"He sent me," I replied.

Kesavadas nodded.

"Good," he said. "Then you will show me where the guns should stand."

There it was.

The truth of why I had been brought.

Men could dig walls.

Few men could see a wall as a platform for fire.

We walked the line together with an escort of soldiers and two local engineers, thin men with calm eyes who carried measuring cords and bamboo poles marked with notches.

One engineer pointed to a low rise and spoke in Malayalam.

"A bastion here," he said. "High ground."

I looked at the rise and then looked beyond it.

High ground is useful, but it is also a promise you must pay for. A bastion on high ground can see far. It can also be seen far.

I crouched and scraped away leaf litter with my hand until the soil showed.

The ground was soft.

Too soft for heavy guns unless it was reinforced.

"It will sink in monsoon," I said.

The engineer frowned, offended by the idea that the earth could betray him.

Kesavadas watched me.

"Then where?" he asked.

I stood and walked ten paces to the left, where the land dipped slightly and the soil felt firmer underfoot.

Here the wall would not be a proud line on a hill.

It would be a hidden line that could still kill.

"Here," I said. "And the bastion should cover that curve."

I pointed to a bend in the intended ditch line where attackers might try to cluster out of direct fire.

Dead ground.

The place a wall cannot see unless you shape it properly.

One engineer argued, polite but stubborn. A bastion on a dip looked weak. A bastion should dominate.

I listened, then drew a quick sketch in the dirt with a stick.

I drew the wall line.
I drew the ditch.
I drew two bastions, each angled to cover the other's face.

Then I drew the arcs of fire.

Not pretty arcs.

Cold arcs, like compass strokes.

The engineer stared, and his mouth tightened as he understood.

If you place the bastion on the rise, you leave dead ground in the bend.
If you place it lower and angle it, you sweep the bend with enfilade fire.

Enfilade is the ugliest kind of killing. It turns a line of men into a corridor of flesh.

It is also how walls survive.

Kesavadas nodded.

"Do that," he said.

The engineers bowed, accepting the decision.

There were no hurt feelings. Hurt feelings do not matter when a kingdom is trying not to die.

---

For weeks after that, I returned to the Lines whenever the fort allowed it.

I walked the ditch line and felt the slope with my feet.

I stood in the cleared corridors and imagined men running toward me with ladders and hooks.

I imagined horses refusing to cross the ditch and then being whipped until they did.

I imagined rockets arcing overhead, screaming into the night.

Then I placed imaginary guns and imagined what those guns could see.

This was the work De Lannoy had trained my mind for.

A wall is a drawing.

A gun is a sentence.

A field of fire is an argument that cannot be negotiated.

I marked positions for batteries where the wall met thicker ground.

I argued for traverses and covered magazines, because I had seen what one spark could do in a confined space.

I pushed for overlapping arcs, because a solitary bastion is a lonely death.

Every bastion placed to cover its neighbour.
Every gun sited to sweep an approach.
Every gap treated as a future disaster.

The engineers began to look at the land the way I did.

Not as beauty.

As angles.

In the evenings, when the labourers sat by their fires and ate rice and fish, I would sit with the engineers and draw.

They would point and argue.

I would correct and explain.

We were speaking the same language without sharing a faith or a birth.

The language of survival.

When my sketches grew into proper plans, I carried them back to Udayagiri for De Lannoy.

He was in the shed when I arrived, seated, his leg stretched out awkwardly, a cloth wrapped around his knee. Margaret was there too, silent in the corner, her face calm and tired.

De Lannoy looked up as I spread the plans on the table.

Hendrik hovered behind him, ready to take control.

Caspar leaned against the doorway, pretending indifference.

I pointed to the line.

"Here," I said in Dutch, "the ditch should deepen. The soil is softer. Attackers will try to fill it."

De Lannoy nodded.

"Here," I continued, "a bastion must be angled to sweep the bend. Otherwise you leave dead ground."

De Lannoy's eyes followed my finger.

His gaze was still sharp. The mind had not frayed the way the body had.

I spoke of traverses and magazines.

I spoke of interlocking fire.

I spoke of the way rockets would behave in open ground, where they would land, how a wall could force their crews into exposed positions.

When I finished, the shed was quiet.

Hendrik's eyes stayed on the plans, his face controlled. He saw the logic. He also saw that the logic had not come from him.

Caspar's gaze moved from the plans to me and back again, restless. He wanted war, not drawings of it.

Margaret watched her husband.

De Lannoy sat very still.

Then he nodded, once, small and decisive.

"You have learned to see what is not yet there," he said.

The words were simple.

They landed in me like a weight.

Because they were praise, and De Lannoy did not praise.

He reached for the crop that lay beside his slate and tapped the plan near the northern bend.

"Make this bastion thicker," he said. "Not for pride. For rockets."

I nodded.

De Lannoy looked at Hendrik then.

"You will oversee the work," he ordered.

Hendrik straightened. "Yes, Father."

De Lannoy's gaze moved to Caspar.

"And you will stay sober at the Lines," he said.

Caspar laughed once, sharp. "I will try," he replied.

De Lannoy did not laugh back.

"Do not try," he said. "Do."

Caspar's smile faltered for a fraction.

Then he nodded, an acknowledgement that carried more weight than obedience.

De Lannoy leaned back slightly and closed his eyes for a moment, as if the effort of decision had cost him.

When he opened them again, he looked older.

The Lines were taking shape.

The wall was becoming real.

And the man who had taught us to build was slowly leaving the work to others.
