# Chapter 26: The Heir of Udayagiri

When De Lannoy was alive, he did not need paper to be powerful.

He had built the fort. Men obeyed him because he had taught them that obedience meant survival. The king obeyed him sometimes because the king understood the value of a foreign mind that did not share local pride.

After De Lannoy died, paper arrived.

Seals.
Orders.
Titles.

As if ink could replace a man.

---

The letter came from Padmanabhapuram three days after the funeral.

It was carried by a palace messenger in clean cloth, protected from rain with an oilskin wrap. The messenger held it as if it were sacred.

Hendrik received it in the shed, standing behind De Lannoy's old table.

His face stayed blank as he broke the wax.

Caspar leaned against the doorway, arms folded, watching with the hard impatience of a man who hated ceremonies that did not involve danger.

I stood to one side, as I always did in moments when power was being rearranged.

Hendrik unfolded the palm-leaf document and read it once, then again.

His throat moved.

He held it out to me without looking.

"Read," he said in Dutch.

The words were in Malayalam, formal and precise. They named Hendrik De Lannoy as commander of Udayagiri Fort's artillery and defensive works. They thanked him for his father's service. They reminded him that the Lines must be completed. They reminded him that Travancore expected loyalty.

Loyalty is always mentioned when a kingdom is afraid it might not receive it.

I handed the letter back.

Hendrik nodded, the motion small but final.

Caspar made a sound, half laugh, half snort.

"Congratulations," he said in Dutch. "Now you are a piece of paper."

Hendrik's eyes snapped to him.

"Now I am responsible," Hendrik replied.

Caspar's smile was sharp. "You were always responsible," he said. "You just have a seal now to make you feel better."

Hendrik stepped forward, anger controlled into a cold edge.

"This is not about feeling," he said. "This is about command."

Caspar's gaze flicked to the wall beyond the shed, then back.

"Command is about men," he said. "Not seals."

For a moment I thought they would fight there in the shed, over their dead father's table.

Then Hendrik turned away, as if refusing to give Caspar the satisfaction of a scene.

"We leave for Padmanabhapuram at dawn," he said. "The king will confirm it in person."

Caspar rolled his eyes.

Hendrik looked at me.

"You will come," he said.

I nodded.

Caspar's gaze sharpened.

"Of course he will," he murmured. "The bridge must attend the coronation."

---

The palace audience was not grand.

Dharma Raja did not like grandness. He preferred rooms where the air held every word and no one could hide behind drums.

The chamber smelled of sandalwood and lamp smoke. The king sat on a simple seat with a cloth draped over it, his posture straight, his face calm.

Raja Kesavadas stood to one side with a writing board.

A Brahmin priest stood near the wall, watching everything with an expression that made judgement look like a religious duty.

A Company agent was present too, as if the English believed they should be in every room where power shifted. He wore plain cloth, but his eyes were the eyes of a man who considered himself entitled.

Hendrik bowed deeply.

"Your Highness," he said in Malayalam, voice controlled.

Dharma Raja looked at him for a long moment.

Then he spoke, quiet.

"Your father held my walls," he said. "He held them with work. Not with blood."

The sentence sounded almost like praise.

Hendrik's jaw tightened.

"I will do the same," he said.

Dharma Raja's gaze moved briefly to me, then back to Hendrik.

"Do not try to be him," the king said. "Be what the wall needs now."

I felt that sentence settle in my bones. Dharma Raja spoke like a man who understood change even when he did not love it.

Kesavadas read the appointment aloud, formal. Hendrik accepted it with the correct words, the correct bows.

Then the king asked the question that mattered.

"How much powder in Udayagiri?" he said.

Hendrik answered without hesitation.

The king asked how many barrels were spoiled by the magazine fire.

Hendrik answered.

The king asked how many men were on the Lines tonight.

Hendrik answered.

Dharma Raja nodded, satisfied not by ceremony but by numbers.

"Then go," he said. "Hold what my uncle built."

The audience ended.

The power had shifted.

No drums.

No swords.

Only a king's quiet voice and a man with new responsibility walking out into the courtyard.

---

On the ride back to Udayagiri, Hendrik spoke little.

The letter was now in his coat, close to his body, as if the paper could warm him.

At the fort gate, men saluted him differently.

Not out of love.

Out of recognition.

Recognition is how authority becomes real.

Hendrik went directly to the gun yard and called the crews into line.

His voice carried.

"Captain De Lannoy built this fort," he said. "He is dead. The fort remains."

He paused.

"I command it now," he said.

No flourish.

No apology.

The gunners stood still.

Some looked resentful.
Some looked relieved.
Most looked tired.

Hendrik continued.

"Pieter van der Berg will oversee gunnery training," he said.

There was a murmur then, small and quick.

My name spoken in that yard felt strange.

Hendrik did not look at me.

He did not say my name with warmth.

He said it as he might have said rope or powder.

Useful.

Indispensable.

Then he dismissed the men and began drilling as if grief had never existed.

---

Caspar did not stay in the yard.

He watched Hendrik for a while, face blank, and then walked away toward the outer wall.

I found him later by the ditch, staring north.

The air smelled of wet earth. The jungle beyond the cleared line looked peaceful, which was the most dangerous kind of lie.

Caspar's hands were in his pockets. His shoulders were tense.

"He has the title," Caspar said without turning.

"Yes," I replied.

Caspar's mouth twisted. "And you have the work," he said.

His voice carried no envy of me. Only bitterness toward the shape of the world.

"And what do you have?" I asked.

Caspar laughed once, sharp.

"Nothing," he said. "No title. No work that matters. Only time."

Time.

The word sounded like a curse in his mouth.

He looked at me then, eyes bright with restless anger.

"War is coming," he said. "Everyone can smell it. And still we dig and drill and pretend the world will wait for us to be ready."

He gestured toward the jungle.

"I want it to come," he admitted, voice low. "I want it to test us. I want it to stop being rumour."

I stared at him.

It was an honest desire.

It was also a dangerous one.

"You want war because peace makes you feel useless," I said.

Caspar's jaw tightened.

"Peace makes me feel dead," he corrected.

He turned away again, staring north.

"My father is in the ground," he said quietly. "And Hendrik wears his name like armour. And you carry his work like a pack animal."

His voice roughened.

"Where do I put my hands?" he asked. "What do I build? What do I inherit?"

The question hung in the damp air.

I had no answer that would satisfy him.

Because the truth was cruel.

Caspar had inherited courage.

He had not inherited a place to put it.

That night, Hendrik wrote orders by lamplight.

I revised drill routines and corrected range tables.

Caspar drank in a shed by the wall and stared into a cup as if waiting for it to answer the question he had asked me.

De Lannoy was buried.

The fort was still standing.

And the sons he left behind were beginning to pull against each other like ropes tied to the same gun.
