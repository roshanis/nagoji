# Chapter 14: Pepper and Lead

Pepper gets into everything.

It clings to cloth. It settles in hair. It hides under fingernails. In warehouses it floats in the air as dust, and if you breathe too deeply you cough and your eyes water, and you understand, in your body, why men crossed oceans for this small black seed.

In Batavia, pepper was counted like scripture. Sacks, weights, percentages, losses, bribes. A man's life could be measured in spice.

In Travancore I learned that war could be measured the same way.

Not in battles.

In ledgers.

Ramayyan had turned Mavelikara into a counting house for a kingdom, and the lesson had spread. Pepper was no longer only spice. It was lead, wages, and walls.

---

The week after the magazine fire, De Lannoy sent me to Padmanabhapuram again.

Not to speak with Major Hawkins.

To speak with the Company's men who did not wear red coats.

The ones who carried ink instead of swords.

They were waiting in a warehouse near the palace compound, a long low building with thick walls meant to keep out damp. Inside, pepper sacks were stacked to the ceiling in neat rows, each marked with chalk symbols. The air was sharp with spice and sweat. Men moved quietly, rolling sacks onto scales, calling out weights to a scribe who wrote without looking up.

The scribe's palm-leaf board was as important as any cannon.

Raja Kesavadas stood near the scale, hands clasped behind his back. He watched the weighing with the same attention I had seen on his face when he watched the English try to slide their hooks into court.

When he saw me, he nodded.

"Pieter," he said. "Come."

On the far side of the warehouse stood a Company agent in plain cloth, not uniform. His coat was dark, his boots clean, his hair powdered in a way that looked absurd in the humid air. He held a handkerchief to his nose as if the smell of pepper was an offence.

Beside him stood an Indian clerk with a bundle of papers tied in string, and two armed sepoys whose eyes scanned the warehouse as if looking for something to shoot.

The agent smiled at me when I approached.

"Mr van der Berg," he said in English, and he pronounced my name carefully, as if proving he could. "We meet again. I am Mr Fraser."

He said it as if the name should carry weight.

Perhaps it did in Madras.

Here it was only a sound in spice dust.

Kesavadas gestured for me to stand between them.

"Translate," he said.

There was no ceremony now. No priests. No ministers. Only pepper, men with pens, and a Company agent who wanted to pretend he was discussing trade instead of power.

---

Fraser began with numbers.

"The Company has assessed the situation," he said, voice smooth. "Mysore's disruptions have made certain routes unsafe. Saltpetre shipments are delayed. Lead is scarce."

I translated into Malayalam, choosing words that did not make it sound like the Company was doing Travancore a favour. In Malayalam, favour and trap are too close.

Kesavadas listened and said nothing.

Fraser continued.

"However," he said, and his smile widened, "the Company is prepared to assist its friends. We can provide saltpetre and lead at favourable rates. We can ensure supply reaches Udayagiri without incident."

Without incident.

As if the Company controlled roads the way it controlled paper.

I translated.

Kesavadas finally spoke.

"The Company is generous," he said in Malayalam.

I translated into English as, "The Company is kind."

Kindness is what men call a knife before they feel it.

Fraser nodded, pleased.

"We do what we can," he said. "Of course, assistance requires arrangements."

Arrangements again.

He pulled one of the tied bundles from his clerk and untied it with deliberate care, as if he was unveiling sacred objects.

"Pepper," he said, tapping a column on the paper. "Travancore produces the finest pepper on the coast. The Company is prepared to purchase in large quantities, in advance, which will provide the court with ready silver."

Advance payments.

Another hook.

I translated into Malayalam. Kesavadas' face did not change.

Fraser leaned in slightly.

"In return," he said, "we would ask for a guarantee of supply at a fixed price. Stable. Predictable."

Predictable for him.

I translated.

Kesavadas lifted his hand slightly, and one of the warehouse men stopped rolling sacks.

The silence was thick.

"You want pepper and you want prices," Kesavadas said. "You want both fixed. Like cannon on a wall."

His Malayalam was plain, almost conversational, but there was steel under it.

I translated.

Fraser's smile tightened, then returned.

"We want fairness," he said. "The Company offers protection and stability. These are valuable."

Protection.

The word tasted rotten to me.

I had grown up under a Company too. I knew what protection meant when a ledger was involved.

Kesavadas nodded slowly.

"Protection is valuable," he agreed.

Then he added, in the same calm tone, "But so is pepper."

I translated.

Fraser spread his hands. "Exactly," he said. "We should work together."

Kesavadas gestured toward the scale.

"How much does a man weigh?" he asked suddenly, in Malayalam.

The warehouse men glanced up, startled.

I hesitated, then translated the question into English because the question was not about weight.

Fraser blinked, confused. "A man?" he repeated. "I beg your pardon."

Kesavadas did not look at him. He looked at me.

"Tell him," he said.

So I told him, because it was what Kesavadas wanted made plain.

"A man weighs as much as his bones and his blood," I said in English. "But a king weighs him in wages and rice. In powder to protect him. In silver to bury him."

Fraser's eyes narrowed. He was beginning to understand that he was not in a Madras office.

Kesavadas spoke again, calm.

"We lost powder last week," he said. "We nearly lost a magazine. If we lose another, we lose Udayagiri. If we lose Udayagiri, we lose the line. If we lose the line, we lose the kingdom."

He pointed at the pepper sacks.

"So yes," he said. "Pepper is valuable. It buys lead. It buys saltpetre. It buys the wages that keep men on the wall when rockets scream."

I translated, and as I spoke I saw Fraser's expression shift.

This was the truth he did not want named.

Pepper was not a luxury.

It was ammunition.

---

Fraser recovered quickly. Company men always do.

"Then we agree," he said. "The Company will supply what is needed. In return, we ask only that Travancore commit its pepper to us first. To avoid misunderstandings."

First.

That was the real word.

First meant monopoly without saying monopoly.

Kesavadas smiled, and it was the most dangerous thing in the room.

"Travancore has committed its pepper to many men over many years," he said. "The Dutch. The Portuguese. The Arabs. The Jews. The kings of the coast. All have wanted pepper. All have promised fairness."

He looked at Fraser directly for the first time.

"Tell me," he said, and his voice stayed polite, "what happened to the Dutch?"

I translated.

Fraser's smile faltered for a fraction, then returned with effort.

"The Dutch have declined," he said. "Circumstances change. The Company adapts."

Kesavadas nodded. "Yes," he said. "Circumstances change."

He let the words hang.

Then he spoke again, and his tone stayed gentle.

"Travancore will buy your saltpetre," he said. "Travancore will buy your lead. Travancore will pay in silver and pepper."

Fraser relaxed, thinking he had won.

Kesavadas continued.

"Travancore will not give you first rights," he said. "Travancore will not fix its pepper price to suit Madras. Travancore will not place its throat in your hand and call it friendship."

The warehouse men held their breath.

I translated into English as smoothly as I could. I softened throat into neck. It was still a threat. It was simply a well-mannered one.

Fraser's face tightened.

"Dalawa," he began, and the title sounded awkward in his mouth, "you must understand the Company's position."

Kesavadas interrupted, voice still calm.

"I understand it very well," he said. "That is why I am refusing."

I translated.

For a moment the room felt as if it might crack like a gun barrel under too much powder.

Then Fraser smiled again, and the smile had changed.

"Of course," he said. "Of course. We are only discussing possibilities."

Possibilities.

Another word for pressure.

He gathered his papers with controlled movements.

"We will make our offer in writing," he said. "The Company values clarity."

Kesavadas nodded as if he approved of clarity.

"So do I," he replied.

---

When Fraser left, the warehouse exhaled.

Men went back to rolling sacks. The scale creaked again. The scribe's reed scratched on palm leaf.

Kesavadas watched the work for a while, silent.

Then he looked at me.

"You have seen this before," he said.

I answered anyway.

"Yes," I said in Malayalam. "In Batavia. In Colombo. In the places where a Company decides that trade is the same thing as rule."

Kesavadas nodded slowly.

"Our kings have always fought with swords and elephants," he said. "Now we must fight with paper."

He gestured toward the pepper sacks.

"And with pepper," he added.

I wanted to laugh, but it would have been hollow.

Instead I asked the question that had been nagging me since the magazine fire.

"How much will the king spend on powder now?" I said. "After the loss."

Kesavadas' gaze went toward the palace compound, as if he could see through walls to the king himself.

"As much as he must," he said.

He paused, then added quietly, "And more than he wants."

That was the truth of war.

Not the bravery.

Not the banners.

The spending.

The choices made in rooms that smell of pepper dust and ink.

That evening, when I returned to Udayagiri, Hendrik met me at the gate and asked, immediately, whether the saltpetre would come.

I told him yes.

He asked what it would cost.

I told him, honestly, that the cost would not fit in a ledger.

Hendrik stared at me as if I had spoken nonsense.

Then he turned away to inspect the gun line, already thinking of drills, of range tables, of things he could control.

In the yard, a boy rolled a powder barrel toward the shed, careful now, eyes wide, as if he had learned what a spark can do.

Pepper buys lead.

Lead buys time.

Time runs out.
