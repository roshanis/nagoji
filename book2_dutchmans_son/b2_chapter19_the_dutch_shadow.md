# Chapter 19: The Dutch Shadow

I had not heard Dutch spoken in anger for years.

Dutch in Travancore was a dead language. It lived only in De Lannoy's mouth when he wanted to cut through hesitation, and in my own when I wanted to think without being overheard.

When you stop hearing a language every day, it becomes a ghost. It returns in dreams. It turns familiar words into echoes.

The day the Dutch ship anchored off the coast, the ghost returned with a flag.

---

We saw it first from the fort wall, a pale shape on the sea, its sails catching light like bone.

Hendrik brought a telescope to the parapet and stared until his eyes watered. Caspar climbed up beside him and squinted at the horizon with theatrical impatience.

"Is it English?" Caspar asked.

"No," Hendrik replied, voice flat. "Dutch."

The word landed on my skin like cold rain.

I took the telescope and looked.

The ship was not large. A trading vessel, not a warship. The sea had bleached its wood. The sails carried a mark, faded but unmistakable.

The VOC monogram.

For a moment my chest tightened so hard I thought I might choke.

Batavia rose in my mind like a smell.

Spice warehouses.
Dock ropes.
My mother's voice.

Then the image shifted, because the VOC had never been only a home. It had also been a machine that chewed men up and called it service.

The ship anchored and waited.

It did not sail away.

---

The court sent a messenger to Udayagiri by evening.

The Dutch factor at the coast requested audience.

Requested.

Even that small word told me something had changed.

In Marthanda Varma's day, the Dutch did not request. They negotiated with cannon.

Now they were sending letters.

De Lannoy read the note and handed it to me.

"You will go," he said in Dutch.

I looked at him.

De Lannoy's eyes held mine.

"You will listen," he added. "You will not argue. You will come back and tell me what kind of Dutch they are now."

His voice carried contempt under the calm.

I understood it.

The Dutch De Lannoy had betrayed were not the Dutch who were coming now.

Those men had been confident.

These men were coming with hats in hand.

---

I rode to the coast with two Travancore guards and a clerk from Kesavadas' office.

The road smelled of wet earth and pepper vines. Fishermen hauled nets in the backwater channels, their bodies slick with sweat and river water. Women squatted by the bank washing cloth, the rhythm of their hands steady and indifferent to European flags.

The world did not care that my old Company had arrived.

At the small coastal landing, the Dutch factor waited under a cloth awning.

He was not young. His hair was thin and powdered. His coat was worn at the cuffs. His boots had been repaired too many times.

He bowed deeply when the Travancore clerk approached.

I watched and felt something inside me shift.

This was not the Dutch of my childhood.

This was a Dutchman who had learned to survive.

The factor's gaze slid to me, and for a moment his face changed.

Recognition.

Then calculation.

"Pieter van der Berg," he said in Dutch, and the sound of my name in his mouth made my throat tighten. "They told me you were here. I did not believe it."

His accent was Amsterdam, clipped and dry. It was not the Batavia Dutch of my mother. It was the Netherlands itself, carried across oceans.

I bowed slightly.

"I am here," I replied.

The factor's eyes moved over my coat, my posture, the way the Travancore guards stood behind me as if I belonged to them.

"So you are," he said softly.

He turned back to the clerk and spoke in Portuguese, polite and careful. He requested permission to trade. He spoke of friendship. He spoke of old agreements.

I translated into Malayalam for the clerk, and as I spoke I watched the factor's hands.

He held them still, but the fingers kept making small movements, as if counting invisible coins.

When the clerk replied, his tone was controlled. Travancore would consider. Travancore had its own agreements. Travancore's king did not forget Colachel.

I translated into Dutch.

The factor's mouth tightened, but he nodded.

"Of course," he said. "Of course. We understand."

Understand.

Another word that meant, we will keep trying.

---

When the formalities ended, the factor asked quietly, in Dutch, "Will you walk with me?"

The Travancore guards shifted. The clerk glanced at me.

I nodded.

We walked along the sand toward the waterline where the ship's longboat waited. The sea air was sharp and clean compared to the fort's powder smell.

The factor spoke without looking at me, as if he was speaking to the sea.

"The Dutch Company is not what it was," he said.

I almost laughed. "It was never what it pretended to be," I replied.

The factor's mouth twitched.

"True," he admitted. "But now it does not even pretend well."

He paused, then added, lower, "Batavia is sick."

The words hit me harder than I expected.

Batavia had been the centre of my world, even when I hated it.

"Sick how?" I asked.

The factor shrugged slightly. "Debt," he said. "Corruption. Wars. Men who steal from the Company and call it profit."

He glanced at me finally.

"The English are different," he said.

There it was.

The sentence I had been waiting for without knowing it.

"How?" I asked.

The factor's gaze went toward the horizon, toward nothing.

"The Dutch trade," he said. "We build factories. We negotiate monopolies. We take, yes, but we do it through paper and ports."

He looked back at the land.

"The English take land," he said. "They take it with treaties at first, then with soldiers, and then they act as if it was always theirs."

I thought of Hawkins and Fraser, their smiles, their words.

Brother.
Assurances.
Arrangements.

The factor's voice stayed calm, but I heard something in it that sounded like fear.

"They do not want pepper only," he continued. "They want the hand that weighs the pepper. They want the road that carries it. They want the village that grows it."

He exhaled slowly.

"They want kings to become clerks," he said.

The phrase made my stomach twist.

Kesavadas had said the same thing in different words.

Fight with paper.

"Then why are you here?" I asked.

The factor's lips pressed together.

"Because we are hungry," he said.

It was the most honest answer he had given.

He reached into his coat and pulled out a folded letter, the paper creased and stained with travel.

"This is for you," he said, and held it out.

My fingers hesitated before taking it.

The letter was sealed with wax, but the seal was broken. The factor had opened it.

He read my hesitation and shrugged.

"I had to know what I was carrying," he said. "In these days, paper is more dangerous than powder."

I stared at the letter.

"From whom?" I asked.

The factor's gaze flicked down and then up again.

"From a chaplain in Cochin," he said. "He writes to the Company about you sometimes. About De Lannoy too. He says there are Dutch men in Travancore who have become something else."

Something else.

That phrase again, from Lakshmi, from my own thoughts, from everyone who could not name what I was.

I turned the letter over in my hands.

The paper felt thin, fragile.

It felt like a bridge that could snap.

"What does it say?" I asked.

The factor smiled faintly. "Read it," he replied. "It will sound like judgement and pity. Priests always think those are useful."

---

I did not open the letter on the beach.

I carried it back to Udayagiri as if it were a live ember.

In the fort shed that night, I broke the seal properly and unfolded the paper.

The chaplain wrote in careful Dutch.

He wrote that the Company had not forgotten Colachel.
He wrote that De Lannoy was a traitor in the eyes of Europe.
He wrote that my name appeared in records as a captured boy presumed dead.
He wrote that rumours said I had married a heathen and raised children outside the church.

He wrote that God forgives the repentant.

He wrote that if I wished to return to the fold, there were ways.

Ways.

Always ways, always arrangements.

He wrote that the English were rising and the Dutch were declining, and that a man should place his soul with a church that would survive.

That last line made me laugh out loud, once, sharp.

As if churches were fortifications.

As if survival was the same as truth.

I folded the letter and set it down.

De Lannoy, who had come into the shed without me hearing, stood in the doorway watching me.

"Well?" he asked in Dutch.

I held up the letter.

"They want me back," I said.

De Lannoy's mouth tightened.

"They do not want you," he replied. "They want the idea that you did not escape them."

He stepped into the shed slowly.

"The Dutch shadow is shrinking," he said. "It will keep shrinking until it is only a story men tell themselves to sleep."

He looked at the letter, then away.

"The English shadow is growing," he continued. "And it will not be satisfied with stories."

His gaze moved to me.

"You have a house," he said. "You have children. That is where you stand."

It was the closest he came to telling me what to feel.

I nodded.

Outside, the fort settled into night, the guns silent, the walls dark.

Beyond them, somewhere on the sea, the Dutch ship waited for an answer that would not save it.

The next morning, it sailed away.

Its sail mark faded into the horizon until it was nothing but a pale line against the water.

I watched until my eyes ached.

Then I turned back to the wall, because the wall was real.

The Dutch were becoming ghosts.

The English were becoming a future.
