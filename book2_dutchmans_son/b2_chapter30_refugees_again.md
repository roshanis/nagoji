# Chapter 30: Refugees Again

Fear travels on bare feet.

Armies need roads and carts and powder and orders.

Fear needs only a rumour and a night without sleep.

After the Lines were tested, the refugees began to arrive.

Not in one wave.

In a steady river of bodies moving south, carrying bundles, carrying children, carrying the smell of burned grain and wet cloth.

They came with stories that sounded like prophecy because fear always wants to be believed.

---

The first group reached Udayagiri at noon, when the sun was hard and bright and the fort wall threw a sharp shadow.

They stood at the gate in a cluster, hesitant, as if afraid the wall would reject them.

There were twenty of them, perhaps thirty, mostly women and children, with two old men walking stiffly at the edge of the group. Their clothes were travel-stained, their feet cracked. One woman carried a baby wrapped in a cloth that had once been white.

The baby did not cry.

That was the first detail that made my throat tighten.

Crying takes strength.

A child who does not cry has spent its strength elsewhere.

The gate captain looked at them with a soldier's suspicion.

"Who are you?" he demanded.

One of the old men stepped forward.

"We are from the north," he said in Malayalam. His voice shook, not from age, from exhaustion. "We are farmers. We had land."

Had.

The past tense is how you know a village has died.

"Why are you here?" the captain asked.

The old man swallowed.

"Mysore," he said, and the word sounded like a sickness in his mouth. "They came. They took grain. They took boys. They burned the shed when my son argued."

His eyes dropped.

"We ran," he said. "We ran before they returned."

The captain hesitated. A fort cannot open its gate to every fear that arrives.

And yet a fort is built to hold something.

It is not only built to keep enemies out.

It is also built to keep humanity in.

I stepped forward.

"Bring them water," I ordered.

The captain looked at me, then nodded sharply and gestured to a soldier.

Water was brought.

The women drank first, quick and desperate, and then forced their children to drink even when the children were too tired to want it.

One girl looked up at me as she drank, eyes wide and flat, and I saw the expression I had seen on Dutch prisoners after Colachel.

The look of people who have learned that the world is not obligated to be kind.

---

Within days, the small group became many.

Refugees began to appear on the road in clusters, then in longer lines.

Men with bundles on their heads.
Women carrying clay pots and sleeping children.
Old people leaning on sticks, moving because staying meant death.

Some came from villages that had been raided.
Some came from towns that had been taxed into hunger.
Some came because they had heard stories and decided hunger was better than slaughter.

They carried rumours the way they carried babies.

"Hyder's men eat children."
"The rockets burn water."
"The Company is coming to take the temples."
"Travancore will close the gate."

Rumour is another kind of refugee.

It runs ahead.

It makes a country sick before the enemy arrives.

Hendrik hated them.

Not as people.

As a problem he could not solve with drill.

He stood on the wall one evening, watching a line of refugees move toward a temporary camp being set up outside the fort, and his jaw tightened.

"They will bring disease," he said.

He was not wrong.

Children coughed. Men had fevers. The smell of human waste clung to the camps because too many bodies were living too close.

But Hendrik's tone was not only fear of disease.

It was fear of disorder.

Refugees are disorder made flesh.

They are proof that walls can fail somewhere else.

Caspar came back from his northern post that week to report on the Lines, and he saw the camp.

He stared at the line of women squatting by a ditch, washing cloth that would never become clean again.

For once, he did not joke.

"This is what we are building a wall for," he said quietly.

I looked at him, surprised.

Caspar's eyes stayed on the camp.

"Not for kings," he added. "For this."

He turned away quickly, as if ashamed of the tenderness in the sentence.

---

Lakshmi went to the camp with other women from the fort households.

They brought rice.
They brought boiled water.
They brought turmeric and salt for wounds.

I went with her once, carrying a sack of dried fish.

The camp smelled of sweat and smoke and fear.

A pot bubbled over a small fire. A woman stirred it with a stick, her face blank. Children sat in the mud and stared.

An old man lay under a palm-leaf shelter, breathing shallowly, his eyes half closed. A boy fanned him with a strip of cloth as if air could drive sickness away.

Lakshmi moved through the camp with the same steady competence she brought to the fort injury room.

She did not ask who deserved help.

She helped.

That was her religion.

A woman stepped in front of her, eyes bright with panic.

"They are coming," she whispered. "They are coming behind us."

Lakshmi set down the pot she was carrying and looked the woman in the face.

"Who is coming?" she asked.

The woman swallowed.

"Mysore," she said. "Rockets. Horses. Men in blue coats. They will burn the wall. They will take the children."

The words poured out as if the woman's mouth could not stop.

Lakshmi listened without interrupting, then reached out and touched the woman's cheek lightly.

"Breathe," she said.

The woman blinked, startled by the simplicity.

"If they are coming," Lakshmi continued, voice calm, "then you will need strength. You do not find strength by drowning in your own fear."

The woman shook, then nodded, clinging to the calm as if it were rope.

Lakshmi turned to me without looking at the woman again.

"Fear is greedy," she said quietly. "It eats the living before the enemy does."

I felt my throat tighten.

She was right.

The refugees were not only bodies to feed.

They were a weapon Hyder did not have to fire.

They spread panic by existing.

---

That night, back at the fort, Hendrik called a meeting in the shed.

He spoke of supplies.
He spoke of disease control.
He spoke of how many men could be spared to guard the camps.

He spoke as if the refugees were a siege.

In a way, they were.

Not a siege of stone.

A siege of the heart.

When the meeting ended, I stood alone for a while on the wall and looked out over the campfires flickering in the dark.

Each fire was a small story.

A family that had fled.
A village that no longer existed.
A rumour that would become truth in someone's mouth by morning.

Beyond the fires, the jungle was black.

Somewhere beyond it, Hyder's army moved.

But it was not the army that filled my mind as I watched the camp.

It was the speed of fear.

Faster than scouts.
Faster than dispatches.
Faster than any wall we could build.

We had built the Lines to keep Mysore out.

The refugees had shown me that Mysore could enter without crossing a ditch.

All it needed was a story.
