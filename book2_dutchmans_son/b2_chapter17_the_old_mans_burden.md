# Chapter 17: The Old Man's Burden

Old men do not collapse.

They fray.

The first thread is small. A hand that takes longer to close around a sword hilt. A breath that comes a little shorter after a flight of steps. A knee that aches before rain as if it has learned to predict weather.

Then the threads multiply.

And one day you look at the man who taught you how to live, and you realise he is becoming a map of his own battles.

By 1770, De Lannoy was approaching sixty.

He was still sharp.

It was his body that had begun to betray him.

---

He hid it well.

He had built his life on control, and pain is a kind of rebellion. He treated it the way he treated disobedience in the gun yard. With contempt and discipline.

On the wall, he still walked as if the stone belonged to him. His limp was controlled, measured, almost elegant. If you did not know him, you might have thought it was a habit, a manner of movement.

If you did know him, you saw the small pauses when he thought no one was watching.

The way his hand would rest on the parapet for a heartbeat before he continued.

The way his breath would catch when he turned too quickly.

The way he stopped climbing the stair to the highest battery unless he had to.

He was losing ground one step at a time.

---

That year the monsoon came early, heavy and persistent, and the fort smelled of damp stone and rust.

We had spent the dry months repairing gun carriages, replacing rotten spokes, tightening bolts. We had built small covered positions along the wall line, crude shelters meant to protect gunners from rocket fragments. Hendrik called them ugly. Caspar called them coffins.

De Lannoy approved them without comment.

On a morning when the rain paused long enough for the yard to fill with pale light, De Lannoy came down to inspect the new cover works.

He moved slowly, but his eyes missed nothing.

He stopped at the first shelter and ran his fingers along the wood.

"Too thin," he said in Malayalam.

Hendrik stiffened. "It will stop splinters," he replied.

"It will stop splinters," De Lannoy agreed. "It will not stop iron."

He looked at me.

"What thickness?" he asked in Dutch.

The question was not really for me. It was for Hendrik. De Lannoy used me sometimes like a mirror, showing his son how he wanted him to think.

I answered anyway.

"As thick as we can manage," I said. "And angled. Not flat. Flat catches."

De Lannoy nodded.

He turned to Hendrik.

"Angle it," he ordered.

Hendrik's jaw tightened, but he nodded.

Discipline has many faces. Sometimes it is obedience. Sometimes it is swallowing pride.

Caspar watched from the edge of the yard with his arms folded, his burned hands still marked, the skin on his palms slightly darker where it had healed. He looked at his father with an expression that was hard to read.

Not contempt.

Not pity.

Something closer to fear.

---

When the inspection ended, De Lannoy walked back toward the shed and his leg gave a small sudden tremor.

It was nothing. A twitch. The kind of movement most men would ignore.

But De Lannoy's face tightened, and he stopped.

He stood still, hand on the shed post, breathing carefully through his nose.

The yard's noise continued around him as if nothing had happened.

Men laughed at a joke.
A mule shook rain from its flank.
A gunner shouted at a boy to fetch oil.

De Lannoy waited until the tremor passed, then straightened.

Only then did he look at me.

"Inside," he said in Dutch.

I followed him into the shed and closed the door behind us.

The shed's familiar smells wrapped around me. Chalk dust. Old leather. Powder residue ground into wood.

De Lannoy sat heavily on the low stool by the table.

For a moment he did not speak.

His breath came shallow. Sweat shone at his temple.

I had never seen him sit like that.

Not defeated, but forced.

As if his body had issued an order he could not refuse.

"Pain?" I asked, because the word felt safer than silence.

De Lannoy gave a small humourless laugh.

"Old age," he said. "Pain is what old age uses to speak."

He took a cup of water and drank, slow.

Then he looked at me, and in his eyes there was an openness I had not seen before.

It was the look of a man who has run out of time for performance.

"I have been careful with you," he said.

The sentence startled me more than it should have.

Careful.

De Lannoy was not a man who used that word about people.

"Why?" I asked.

He set the cup down.

"Because you were a boy with hate in your mouth," he said. "And hate is useful. Until it is not."

He paused.

"Because I did not want you to love me," he continued. "Love makes men stupid."

He glanced toward the wall, invisible through the shed.

"A fort needs men who are not stupid," he said.

I wanted to argue. I wanted to say love can also make men stand. Love can make them hold a wall when fear tells them to run.

But I understood what he meant.

He had not built this army on affection.

He had built it on work.

Work survives feelings.

---

He spoke more that day than he usually did.

Not in long speeches. De Lannoy never wasted words.

In short statements that landed like shot.

"The Company will keep smiling."

"Hyder will keep learning."

"Your king is good, but goodness does not stop rockets."

He tapped the table with one finger.

"When I die," he said, and he said it as if he were talking about a bolt that would eventually snap, "Hendrik will have the command. He will want to be my shadow. Shadows do not hold walls."

I stared at him.

De Lannoy looked toward the door as if he could see his sons through it.

"Caspar will want to be fire," he continued. "Fire burns what it touches, including itself."

He looked back at me.

"And you," he said quietly, "will be between them."

Margaret had said the same words to me years before.

Between them.

The repetition made my chest feel tight, as if fate had found a phrase and would not let go.

"Why are you telling me this?" I asked.

De Lannoy's mouth tightened.

"Because I cannot tell them," he said. "Hendrik hears orders, not fear. Caspar hears danger, not advice."

He paused, then added, softer, "And Margaret is tired of being the only one who speaks to both."

The mention of his wife did something to his face.

Not softness.

Weariness.

The weariness of a man who had spent a lifetime being strong in public and wanted, briefly, to be weak somewhere private.

But weakness was not permitted to him.

Not even now.

---

When I left the shed, the rain had started again.

It fell in thick sheets, drumming on the fort's roofs, turning the yard into slick mud.

De Lannoy stayed inside.

He did not come out for evening drill.

Hendrik took command without comment, his voice snapping across the yard, the gunners moving by habit.

Caspar watched from under an eave, cup in hand, his eyes on the shed door as if he expected his father to emerge and prove the body wrong.

He did not.

That night, at home, Lakshmi watched me quietly while I ate.

She could always tell when something had shifted in me.

"He is getting older," she said finally, watching my face.

"Yes," I admitted.

Lakshmi nodded, as if she had already counted the years and reached the same conclusion.

"Then you must become older too," she said.

Her voice was not unkind.

It was practical.

That was her gift.

She did not comfort me with lies.

She reminded me of duties.

I lay awake that night listening to the rain and thinking of De Lannoy's hand on the shed post, the small tremor in his leg, the moment he could not pretend.

I had been remade by him.

Now the man who remade me was fraying.

And I could already feel the fort's weight shifting toward my shoulders.
