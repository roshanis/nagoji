# Chapter 4: Lessons in Iron

De Lannoy taught with objects first, because objects do not lie.

He took a cannonball the size of a coconut and put it on the table between us. The table was rough teak in a room that smelled of oil and damp paper, set inside the fort above the gun yard. Maps lay rolled in a corner. A slate board leaned against the wall. A quadrant hung from a nail like a priest's instrument.

I had expected punishment for my ignorance. Instead I was given lessons.

De Lannoy tapped the cannonball with one finger.

"This is honest," he said. "It does not care whether you are Dutch or Nair or Maravar. It does not care what god you pray to. It does not care what you believe about honour. It only cares about weight, speed, and angle."

He rolled the ball toward me. It thudded against my palm, heavier than it looked.

"Feel it," he said. "That weight becomes a decision when it leaves the barrel."

I looked at him, uncertain whether this was philosophy or merely another way to tell me to stop being stupid.

De Lannoy took a piece of charcoal and drew a line on the slate.

"If you point the gun straight," he said, drawing a horizontal line, "the ball leaves, drops, and hits the sand in front of you. It is noise and smoke. It frightens men and does nothing."

Then he drew an arc, rising and falling.

"If you lift the barrel," he continued, "the ball travels. It follows this curve, always this curve. It cannot do anything else. Gravity is the king that never dies."

His finger traced the arc again. I found myself following it with my eyes, as if the line could explain the chaos of Colachel.

"So we do not guess," De Lannoy said. "We measure."

He lifted the quadrant from the nail and placed it in my hands.

It was a simple device, brass and wood, with a plumb line and markings cut into the metal. It felt strange to hold something so precise in a fort built of mud and stone and palm timber.

"Angle," he said. "Read it."

I peered at the markings. "Two degrees."

"Again."

I shifted the quadrant slightly. The plumb line swung, settled. "Three."

"Again."

We did it until my eyes stopped watering and my hands stopped shaking.

Outside the window, guns fired on the range. The sound was familiar now. Not the scream of battle, but the steady thunder of work.

De Lannoy watched the plumb line settle and nodded.

"Now you know how to lift a barrel," he said. "You do not yet know what that lift means. That comes next."

---

He gave me numbers as if numbers were food.

Range tables. Powder measures. Shot weights. The width of a barrel. The depth of a vent. The speed of a crew that could fire three rounds a minute versus a crew that could barely manage one.

He made me write them down in Dutch first, because Dutch was the language of my shame and my pride. Then he made me write them again in Malayalam characters, because Malayalam was the language of the fort and the men and the future that would not ask permission.

My hand cramped. My mind protested. I wrote anyway.

Every morning we went to the gun yard. De Lannoy would point at a gun and ask me, without warning, for the elevation at a certain range, the powder charge required in wet weather, the correction for wind from the sea.

When I answered wrong, he did not shout. He had a simpler cruelty.

"Again," he would say.

And we would do it again until I answered right.

The older Travancorean gunners watched with curiosity and amusement. They had expected the Dutch boy to be beaten into obedience. Instead he was being drilled like a recruit, forced to become competent.

Competence, I learned, is its own kind of captivity.

The better I became, the more indispensable I became. The more indispensable I became, the less likely I was to be allowed to leave.

At sixteen, I did not yet have the wisdom to understand that leaving was no longer possible anyway.

---

The first time I truly understood what gunnery was, it happened in silence.

De Lannoy took me to the range behind the fort, a strip of cleared land where targets had been set up at measured distances. Old palm trunks stood at fifty paces, a wall of packed sand at a hundred, a whitewashed board with a red circle at two hundred.

The gun crew waited by a small field piece, a lighter gun than the ones at Colachel, mounted on a carriage that could be moved quickly. The men were barefoot, their clothes damp with sweat, their faces calm.

De Lannoy pointed to the white board with the red circle.

"Two hundred," he said. "Sea wind from the west. Slight damp. Powder is good."

He handed me the quadrant.

My palms were slick. I wiped them on my trousers and tried not to let the gunners see my fear.

I set the quadrant against the breech, watched the plumb line settle.

The numbers came into my head the way prayers once had, without thought. Two degrees, perhaps slightly more. Adjust for wind. Adjust for damp.

I opened my mouth to speak. The words did not come in Dutch. They came in something else, a mixture of Dutch numbers and Malayalam habit, as if my mind had already begun to become the thing it was being trained to become.

"Two and a half," I said finally. "A little more."

De Lannoy did not look at me. He looked at the board.

"Set it," he told the crew.

The gunner adjusted the elevating wedge. The barrel rose slightly, a change so small it looked like nothing.

They loaded. Sponge, powder, wad, shot, wad. The rhythm was almost soothing. A match flared. The gunner stepped back.

De Lannoy raised one hand.

For a moment, everything narrowed.

The gun. The line of sight. The red circle on the board.

Even the birds seemed to pause.

De Lannoy dropped his hand.

The gun fired.

The recoil jumped through the carriage into the earth. Smoke burst outward and then drifted away on the sea wind. The sound hit my chest and made my ribs vibrate.

For a heartbeat, I could see nothing but smoke.

Then the wind tore a hole in it and the board appeared again.

The red circle had a hole through it.

Not perfectly centred, but close enough that the gunners grunted approval.

The world did not cheer. No drums beat. No one shouted.

De Lannoy only nodded.

"That is gunnery," he said quietly. "Not noise. Not bravery. A line and a curve and a man who can make his hands obey his mind."

The crew began to reload without waiting for praise.

My mouth was dry. I tasted powder.

I had put that hole in the red circle with a number spoken aloud.

I had done it without thinking.

The thought should have made me proud.

Instead it made me cold.

At Colachel, men had died because someone like me, somewhere in the Travancorean line, had spoken numbers with calm hands.

Now I was becoming that kind of man.

---

De Lannoy did not allow me to stay in the comfort of abstraction.

A week after the range exercise, he walked me to the magazine.

The powder store sat under thick stone, away from the main barracks. The roof was low. The doors were heavy. The air inside was dry and smelled of sulphur and old wood. Barrels were stacked with careful gaps between them, because fire spreads faster when men are careless with space.

De Lannoy took a small iron scoop from a shelf.

"How much powder is in this barrel?" he asked.

I frowned. "I do not know."

He looked at me, expression flat. "Then you do not know how many shots you can fire. You do not know how many hours you can hold the wall. You do not know when you must stop because bravery will not create powder out of air."

He set the scoop down.

"A fortress is not walls," he said. "A fortress is logistics. It is rice, it is water, it is saltpetre and sulphur. A man who commands guns must command ledgers too. Do you understand?"

I did, in a way that made my stomach tighten.

My father had been a Company trader. He had spoken of ledgers with boredom. I had thought war was separate from that world.

De Lannoy was telling me the opposite. That war was accounting written in blood.

He walked me through the magazine and made me count. Barrels, weights, storage conditions. He made me write the numbers down. He made me calculate how many rounds each battery could fire before the magazine ran dry.

Halfway through, I heard shouting outside.

De Lannoy stopped, listening.

The shouting grew sharper, urgent. Feet ran past the magazine door. Someone screamed.

De Lannoy's hand went to his sword without drama.

"Come," he said.

We ran into the yard.

A gun crew had made a mistake.

I saw it in the first second, because De Lannoy had already trained my eyes to look for the wrong thing. A powder charge that was too large. A man holding the match too close. A vent that had not been cleared properly.

The gun fired, but not cleanly. The barrel belched smoke and then a crack like a tree splitting. The crew flinched back. One man screamed and clutched his leg, blood pumping between his fingers where iron had torn through his thigh.

The gun did not burst fully. If it had, half the yard would have been flesh and splinters.

De Lannoy moved fast. He was at the gun in two strides, shouting in Malayalam, pushing men back, forcing distance, forcing control.

He grabbed the gunner's injured leg, ripped the man's hand away, and looked at the wound with the same calm he had used on my rope burn.

"Pressure," he snapped.

Someone wrapped cloth around the leg. Someone else brought water.

De Lannoy turned to the rest of the crew.

His voice was quiet now, which was worse than shouting.

"Who measured the charge?" he asked.

The men looked down. No one answered.

De Lannoy's gaze swept them like a gun barrel.

"Who?" he repeated.

A boy stepped forward. Younger than me. His eyes were wide with terror.

De Lannoy looked at him for a long moment. Then he did not strike him. He did not shout. He did something more precise.

He made the boy pick up the broken iron fragment that had torn the gunner's arm.

The boy's hands shook as he held it.

"Carry that," De Lannoy said, "until you can feel its weight in your sleep. Carry it until you never forget that iron does not forgive."

Then he turned away and called for the gun to be taken out of service.

The yard went quiet.

I stood with my throat tight, watching blood drip into the mud.

De Lannoy looked at me.

"You see now," he said.

I nodded, unable to speak.

"Good," he replied. "Remember it. Discipline is not ceremony. It is survival."

---

That evening, as the rain cooled the stones and the fort settled into night, De Lannoy called me back to his room.

He had laid out three objects on the table: a cannonball, a handful of powder grains in a small dish, and a small wooden horse carved roughly, the kind a child might play with.

"Artillery," he said, touching the ball. "Infantry," he said, touching the powder grains. "Cavalry," he said, touching the horse.

He pushed the cannonball forward so it rolled across the table and knocked the wooden horse onto its side.

"Artillery decides battles," he said. "It breaks formations. It makes brave men into meat."

He scattered the powder grains with his fingertips.

"Infantry holds ground," he continued. "Not because it is glorious. Because someone has to stand when the world is trying to move you."

Then he stood the wooden horse upright again and rolled it forward.

"Cavalry exploits," he finished. "It moves where the break is. It turns a crack into a collapse."

He looked up at me. His eyes were tired.

"Remember the order," he said.

I stared at the table, at the objects now rearranged by his hands.

It was so simple. Too simple. Colachel had been chaos and smoke and screaming horses. Yet here, on a table, it became something that could be understood.

That was De Lannoy's gift.

He could look at war and see structure.

He could teach structure to a boy who had thought war was only noise.

As I left his room, the smell of powder still in my nose, I realised I had not thought about escape all day.

I had thought about angles.

That was the most frightening transformation of all.
