# Chapter 3: The Captive Boy

They moved us before dawn, because men are easier to manage when they cannot see where they are going.

The guards came with lanterns hooded against the rain. They tied our wrists in pairs, not too tight, not too loose. Tight enough to remind us who owned the rope. Loose enough that we could walk without falling and breaking bones they still intended to use.

I went out of the prison with ten other Dutch boys and men. Some were wounded like me, limping, mouths clenched against pain. Others were hollow-eyed from fever. One man coughed constantly, the sound wet and deep, and by the time we reached the yard he was leaving dark flecks on the ground.

The fort smelled different from the prison. Less rot. More oil, more powder. Metal warmed by the day and cooling in the night. Even in the dark, I could hear work: a hammer on iron, a cart wheel creaking, a mule snorting as someone tightened a strap.

War does not end when a battle ends. It changes shape.

They took us to the gun park.

I had expected to be sent to fields, to dig, to carry stones. Instead we were marched into a yard where cannon sat in rows like sleeping beasts, their barrels slick with rain, their carriages dark with tar. Men moved among them with lanterns and buckets, wiping, oiling, checking ropes and wedges.

Travancore did not treat guns as trophies. They treated them as tools.

De Lannoy stood under the eaves of a shed, a lantern in one hand, a slate board in the other. He wore local cloth and a light breastplate. A sword hung at his side, not decorative. It looked used.

When he saw us, he did not smile. He did not announce himself. He simply pointed.

"You. You. And you." His crop tapped the air as if selecting barrels. When it pointed at me, the man beside me flinched as if the crop had struck him.

The guards untied the selected men from the chain and pushed us forward.

The rest were marched away toward the inner yard, still linked by rope, their faces turned toward us with a mixture of envy and terror. No one knew what being chosen meant. In prison, any selection can be an execution wearing clean clothes.

De Lannoy looked at me as if my fear was a minor inconvenience.

"Name," he said in Dutch.

"Pieter," I replied.

"Full."

"Pieter van der Berg."

He made a small mark on the slate. "Age."

"Sixteen."

His eyebrows rose slightly, as if confirming his earlier judgement. "Hands."

I held them out. They were scraped and raw. Powder black still clung to the creases of my fingers, as if the battle at Colachel had stained me permanently.

De Lannoy turned to the Travancorean officer beside him and spoke in Malayalam. I did not understand the words, but I understood the tone. Instruction. Assurance. A man used to being obeyed.

Then he looked back at me.

"You will learn gunnery," he said. "If you do not learn, you will die in a place no one will ever name."

It was not a threat. It was a statement of arithmetic.

---

I began at the lowest point.

The first week I did not touch powder. I did not touch shot. I did not even touch a match. My task was water and cloth and oil.

Clean the barrel.

Scrape the vent.

Oil the trunnions.

Check the carriage bolts for rust.

I learned quickly that a gun is not a single object. It is a marriage of wood and iron, of rope and wedge and human hands. A barrel can be perfect and still useless if the carriage is rotten. A crew can be brave and still dead if the vent is fouled and the gun misfires.

De Lannoy moved among us like a man walking through his own thoughts. He did not shout much. When he did, it was because someone was about to die through carelessness.

One morning, a Travancorean gunner tried to light the slow match with his face too close to the vent. De Lannoy hit his wrist with the crop hard enough to make him yelp.

"You want to lose your eyes?" he snapped, then switched into Malayalam, sharp and quick. The gunner shrank, ashamed, rubbing his wrist.

Afterwards De Lannoy did something I did not expect. He took the man's hand and showed him again, slowly, the correct way to hold the match, the correct distance, the angle. Not humiliation. Correction.

I watched and understood something unwillingly.

He did not enjoy power. He used it.

That made him more dangerous than men who shouted for pleasure.

And yet I could not trust the gentleness. Papist gentleness, I thought. The soft voice that hides the Inquisition. My father had told me stories of Catholic mercy - how it always came with conditions, how the hand that healed also held the rack. De Lannoy's patience felt like a trap I could not see the shape of.

---

At night, the prison dreams did not stop.

I still heard the cannon at Colachel. I still saw bodies thrown like sacks. I still tasted sand when I breathed.

Sometimes, in those dreams, De Lannoy was Dutch again. Sometimes he was Travancorean. Sometimes he was neither, only a shadow with a crop pointing at me from the smoke.

In the daylight, I kept my mouth shut.

I answered questions with the smallest number of words possible. I did not join the other gunners when they laughed. I did not accept their offered water when they drank. I pretended I did not understand their Malayalam insults and their sideways glances when my lips moved in Lutheran prayers I no longer believed but could not stop reciting.

I told myself my silence was dignity.

It was also cowardice. Speaking would have meant admitting I belonged here, even as a tool, even as a prisoner with cleaner clothes.

The other Dutch boys who had been selected with me had their own strategies. One tried to ingratiate himself with the Travancoreans by laughing too loudly and praising their king. Another prayed constantly, his lips moving over Lutheran phrases that sounded weak in the tropical air. A third picked fights with local gunners and got beaten for it.

I watched and kept silent.

De Lannoy tolerated all of it, but he did not indulge it.

When the loud boy bowed too low, De Lannoy said, flatly, "A gun does not care who flatters it. It cares who loads it correctly."

When the praying man asked whether God would forgive us for serving heathens, De Lannoy replied, "God forgives sinners who confess. He does not resurrect the careless. Pray if it comforts you, but learn if you wish to live."

When the fighter spat at a Travancorean gunner and called him a savage, De Lannoy had him whipped and then sent him back to the prison chain.

The next morning there was one less Dutch boy in the yard.

The lesson was plain.

De Lannoy was offering survival. He was not offering comfort.

---

After two weeks, he gave me powder.

He called me to the shed where the powder was kept, dry as a chapel inside. Barrels were stacked in rows. A small lamp burned behind a glass shield, its flame steady, controlled. No open fire. No careless sparks.

De Lannoy stood beside a table with a set of brass measures and a small scale.

"You know numbers," he said.

"I know enough."

"Enough gets men killed." He tapped the scale. "A gun is honest. It gives exactly what you give it. Too much powder and it bursts. Too little and it fails. That is why I like guns. They do not pretend."

He placed a measure in my hand.

"Fill it," he said.

I did, carefully, the fine black grains sliding like sand. My fingers twitched at the smell. Powder smells of danger. It smells of possibility.

De Lannoy watched without blinking.

"Level it," he said.

I took a flat stick and levelled the powder, scraping the excess back into the barrel with slow precision.

He nodded.

"Now weigh it," he said.

I poured it onto the scale pan. The needle dipped, steadied.

De Lannoy leaned in. "Read it."

I read the weight.

"Again," he said.

We did it again. And again. And again, until my hands stopped shaking.

Only when I could fill and level and weigh with the same number each time did he let me step outside with a powder charge and carry it to the gun crew.

The first time the gun fired with a charge I had measured, I felt a strange pride. I had created that thunder with my own hands. I had turned black grains into force.

Then I remembered the headless man at Colachel, and the pride curdled into nausea.

De Lannoy noticed.

He did not comment.

He simply kept teaching.

---

The strangest part of captivity was not the work. It was the moments when I saw the king.

Marthanda Varma came to Udayagiri twice in those early months, riding with a small escort, moving through the fort as if it was an extension of his own body. He was not tall. His face was plain, his eyes unreadable. There was no gold on him, no display, only a sense of coiled authority that made men step aside without thinking.

I watched him from the edge of the yard, hands black with oil, as he spoke with De Lannoy.

The conversation was in Malayalam. I could not understand it. I understood the posture. The king's head slightly inclined, listening. De Lannoy's hands moving in small gestures, describing arcs in the air, pointing to cannon placements, to the wall line, to the sea beyond. The king did not look at us, the Dutch boys, even once.

We were not worth his attention. Or perhaps we were too worth it, and he had learned not to waste emotion on captured enemies.

When he left, the fort exhaled.

One of the Travancorean gunners muttered something about the king's temper and laughed quietly. Another made a gesture of reverence.

De Lannoy watched the king ride away and then looked back at the guns, expression unchanged.

He had been a prisoner once. Now he was advising the man who had captured him.

Travancore did that to people. It swallowed them, digested them, and used what it could.

That should have frightened me more than it did.

---

The first time De Lannoy spoke to me as a person rather than a pair of hands was during rain.

A sudden storm rolled in from the sea and turned the yard into mud. Work continued anyway. The guns had to be covered, the powder moved, the ropes checked. Rain is a weapon in the tropics. It ruins powder, rots wood, sickens men.

I was hauling a canvas over a gun when the rope slipped and burned a line across my palm. I hissed and clenched my fist.

De Lannoy was beside me before I realised he had been watching.

"Open it," he said.

I did.

He took my hand and examined the burn, his touch brisk, professional.

"You will lose skin," he said. "You will not lose function."

Then he did something that made my throat tighten in a way I did not understand. He tore a strip of cloth from his own sleeve and wrapped my palm, tying it with the same care he used when lashing a gun wheel.

"Why?" I heard myself ask.

His eyes lifted to mine. Rain ran down his face. He did not wipe it away.

"Because if you cannot hold a rope you cannot hold a sponge," he said. "And if you cannot hold a sponge you will die when a gun misfires."

It was the practical answer.

But it was not the full answer. I could see that in the steadiness of his gaze.

He let go of my hand.

"You hate me," he said, as if discussing the weather.

I did not reply. Silence had been my armour for weeks.

De Lannoy nodded slightly. "You should. Hatred is clean. It keeps you awake."

He glanced toward the sea, invisible behind sheets of rain.

"But hatred is also heavy," he continued. "If you carry it too long, it will drown you. I have seen men drown on dry land."

He looked back at me.

"Learn, and live," he said. "That is all I offer."

Then he walked away, leaving me standing in the rain with my palm wrapped in his cloth and my mouth full of words I did not want.

That night, when I lay on my pallet, I found myself remembering his earlier question at the gun line.

What is the range at two degrees elevation?

I stared at the darkness until my eyes ached, and I began to calculate.
