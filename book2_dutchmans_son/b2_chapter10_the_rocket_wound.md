# Chapter 10: The Rocket Wound

The first rocket wound I saw in Travancore arrived on a bullock cart.

It came under a torn canopy of palm leaves, with flies already circling. The cart wheels creaked in the fort gate, and the sound drew men the way blood draws dogs. Soldiers gathered, curious, then recoiled when the smell reached them.

Burned flesh has its own language. It does not smell like clean firewood or kitchen smoke. It smells like hair and fat and cloth melted into skin. It smells like something that should not exist.

The wounded man lay on his side, teeth clenched, eyes half-closed. His shirt had been cut away and the flesh of his shoulder and ribs was blistered and blackened in patches, as if someone had thrown boiling oil and then pressed hot iron into him for good measure.

This was not a musket wound.

This was not a cannon wound.

This was something else.

---

I pushed through the ring of men and climbed onto the cart.

The wounded man's breath rattled. When he inhaled, his ribs lifted unevenly. A smaller man might have screamed. This man made no sound. Pain had gone past noise and become a steady thing that lived in the body.

De Lannoy appeared beside me, as if he had been standing behind my shoulder all along.

He did not ask who the man was. He did not ask which god had been offended. He looked at the burns, the ragged tears in the skin beneath them, and he asked the only question that mattered.

"Where did this happen?" he said.

The escort captain, dusty and hollow-eyed, saluted. "North of Palakkad," he said. "On the road. We were bringing saltpetre from Coimbatore. We thought the passes were quiet."

Quiet, I thought, the way a tiger is quiet before it moves.

De Lannoy's gaze held on the man's shoulder.

Embedded in the burned flesh were small dark points, like seeds under skin. When I touched one gently with the tip of a knife, the man flinched so hard the cart shook.

Not seeds.

Fragments.

Shrapnel.

I had seen shrapnel once, long ago, in Ceylon, when a gun burst and the barrel turned into a swarm of knives. But this was different. These fragments were too uniform, too numerous. A gun bursting is an accident. This was design.

"Bring him inside," De Lannoy said.

Men lifted the wounded man carefully, as if afraid his body might fall apart, and carried him toward the infirmary room near the magazine.

As they moved, one of the men in the crowd crossed himself. Another muttered a Malayalam prayer. A third spat, as if spitting could drive bad luck away.

I followed the stretcher and tasted powder in my mouth though there had been no firing.

---

The infirmary was a small room with a low ceiling and a single shuttered window. It smelled of turmeric, old cloth, and sweat that had soaked into the floorboards. The fort's healer, a thin man with calm hands, was already boiling water in a brass pot.

De Lannoy spoke to him in Malayalam, quick and precise.

"We need the fragments," De Lannoy said, then switched to Dutch for my benefit. "If we can take them out, take them out."

The healer glanced at me, then at De Lannoy. He was used to strange orders from the foreign captain. He did not argue. He simply nodded and laid out his tools.

The wounded man opened his eyes.

His gaze found me and held on my face with dull recognition, as if he had seen me somewhere in a fever.

"Parangi," he whispered, the word shaped with contempt and need at the same time.

I felt the old sting in my chest and ignored it. Words were lighter than this man's pain.

"Hold him," the healer said.

Two soldiers took the man's arms. I put my hand on his uninjured shoulder, feeling the heat of his skin through my palm. His body trembled.

The healer washed the burns with cooled water. The wounded man's throat tightened and a thin sound escaped him, not a cry, more a cough forced out by pain.

Then the healer began to pull.

The first fragment came free with a wet sound.

It was not lead. It was iron, dark and jagged, no bigger than my fingernail. The healer dropped it into a small bowl with a sharp clink.

Another. Another. Another.

Each piece made the same sound when it hit the bowl, like coins that no one wanted.

The wounded man bit down on a cloth and shook. Sweat rolled down his temples. The cloth darkened with saliva and blood.

When the healer reached deeper, the man finally broke. He clawed at the soldiers holding him, a full-bodied animal panic, and one soldier nearly lost his grip.

I leaned in close and spoke in Malayalam, because it was the only language I had in this land that sounded like comfort.

"Breathe," I said. "Breathe and you will live."

The words felt foolish as soon as I said them.

The man stared at me, eyes wild, and then, with effort that looked like courage, he dragged in a breath.

---

When the healer had taken out as many fragments as he could reach, he stepped back, hands stained.

"There is more," he said, calm. "Too deep. If I chase it, I will kill him."

De Lannoy nodded, accepting the limits.

He turned to the bowl of fragments.

I picked up one with tweezers and held it to the light. The edges were sharp but not random. One side was slightly curved, as if it had been part of a tube.

I picked up another. Same curve.

I was looking at pieces of a casing.

Not a gun barrel.

A rocket.

The word came into my head with a cold certainty.

The messenger's story from yesterday stopped being a story and became metal in my hand.

I set the fragments down and looked at the wounds again, not as a healer would, not as a priest would, but as a gunner.

The burn patterns mattered. The clustering of shrapnel mattered. The way some fragments had entered at an angle and others straight on mattered.

The wounded man's body was an arithmetic problem written in flesh.

That thought should have revolted me more than it did.

Instead it steadied me.

That was when I understood something ugly about myself.

---

When the wounded man had been given a bitter potion to dull his pain, De Lannoy questioned the escort captain in the shed.

Hendrik came in, face tight. Caspar hovered near the doorway, pretending he had wandered in by accident.

De Lannoy unrolled the map again.

"Tell me exactly," De Lannoy said. "Where you were. How many. What you saw."

The captain swallowed. "We were on the road below the pass," he said, pointing with a dirty finger. "Two carts. Eight men. No soldiers, only guards. We heard nothing at first. Then the sound came."

He paused, as if embarrassed by how afraid he still felt.

"Like a demon," he said finally. "Like something screaming because it hates being alive."

Caspar's eyes flicked to mine, quick, and then away.

"And then?" De Lannoy said.

"Smoke," the captain said. "Fire. The first rocket hit the road in front of us and bounced. It bounced like a stone on water. It went under the lead cart and burst there. The cart lifted and fell on the oxen. The oxen screamed and broke their harness."

His hands moved as he spoke, involuntary, as if his body was still trying to dodge.

"Another rocket hit a tree and spun," he said. "It came at us sideways. It burst behind the second cart. That is when he was hit."

He nodded toward the infirmary.

"We fired our matchlocks," the captain said. "We fired into smoke. We did not hit anything. Then men came out of the smoke with bayonets. Bayonets, Parangi style. They did not run. They walked. They killed the two guards who tried to stand. The rest of us ran."

He looked at the floor.

"We abandoned the saltpetre," he said. "We abandoned the carts. We carried him, and we ran until our lungs felt like torn cloth."

De Lannoy's crop tapped the map once, not in anger, but in thought.

Hendrik spoke, controlled. "How many rockets?"

"Five," the captain said. "Maybe six. After the first two, I stopped counting. Counting did not help."

It was a soldier's confession.

De Lannoy looked at me. "What do you think?" he asked.

The shed felt suddenly smaller. I could feel all of them watching me, waiting for the foreign gunner to translate fear into something useful.

I picked up one of the fragments again.

"Iron casing," I said. "Not a gun burst. Deliberate. The shrapnel is too consistent."

Hendrik nodded slightly, his mind already moving toward counters, toward drills.

Caspar leaned forward, interested despite himself. "Can you make them?" he asked.

De Lannoy's eyes snapped to him. Not anger. Warning.

"You can make anything that burns," De Lannoy said. "The question is whether you can control it."

I turned the fragment between the tweezers.

"They do not need control," I said quietly. "Not perfect control. They need fear. A rocket that misses still screams. A rocket that skids still forces men to look away. It breaks formation."

The words sounded strange in Malayalam, but they were true in any language.

De Lannoy's gaze stayed on me.

"Write it down," he said.

It was an order. It was also permission.

---

That night I sat in the shed long after the gun yard had gone quiet.

I drew the wound in charcoal on a scrap of paper. I drew the clustering of fragments, the burns, the angles. I drew the curve of the iron casing as best I could, then wrote notes beside it in Dutch, because Dutch was the language I used when I wanted distance.

Approximate casing thickness.

Approximate powder charge.

Estimated range from scatter pattern.

None of it was certain. Rockets were unpredictable. That was the point. But the fragments told a story even when the flight path did not.

I should have felt only horror.

I felt horror.

I also felt a cold admiration, the way a man might admire a knife that is well made even as he watches it cut a throat.

That was the part of me I did not like to look at.

I heard footsteps outside and tensed, instinctive. Then Lakshmi's voice spoke my name, soft.

"Pieter," she called.

I stepped out of the shed.

Lakshmi stood in the moonlight with a shawl around her shoulders. Her hair was loose, dark against her skin. Behind her, the fort was a black shape against the sky.

"You did not come home," she said.

I wiped my hands on my cloth though there was no grease on them.

"There was work," I said.

Lakshmi's eyes moved to the paper in my hand. She did not ask to read it. She knew it was not meant for her. She knew I used writing the way some men used prayer.

"Work," she repeated, and the word carried a judgement.

She stepped closer and touched my cheek with her fingertips.

"You smell like burned flesh," she said.

The truth of it made my throat tighten.

I had washed my hands. I had rinsed my face. The smell was still in me, as if it had found a way into the pores.

Lakshmi's voice stayed steady.

"Do not bring that fire into the house," she said. "If it lives in you, it will try to live in our children."

I wanted to tell her that fire was already in the world, already moving south, and that a man could not keep it out by closing a door.

Instead I nodded.

Lakshmi took my hand and pulled me toward home.

Behind us, in the infirmary, a man groaned in his sleep, and the sound followed me like a rope tied around my ankle.
