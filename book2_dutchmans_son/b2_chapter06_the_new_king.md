# Chapter 6: The New King

A king's first weakness is always hope.

Hope makes men believe the future will be kinder than the past. It makes them forget that kingdoms do not care about goodness. They care about force, food, and the patience to outlast the next famine or invasion.

When Dharma Raja took the throne, the court was full of hope.

I watched it spread through the palace like perfume, sweet and unnecessary. Men who had feared Marthanda Varma's temper began to speak more loudly. Priests who had been careful with their words began to advise more boldly. Old families who had bowed and swallowed their hatred began to smile as if time itself had joined their side.

The guns on the wall did not care.

The first time I stood in Dharma Raja's presence properly, it was not at the coronation. It was in a smaller room, quieter, where decisions were made without drums.

The audience chamber smelled of sandalwood and warm oil lamps. The ceiling was low for a palace, carved beams dark with age, so the air held every whisper. A curtain hung over the doorway, thick cloth embroidered with gold thread that caught the lamplight and turned it into small fires.

Dharma Raja sat on a simple wooden seat with a cloth draped over it. There were no jewels on his hands. No sword at his hip. A scholar's posture, straight but not rigid. His eyes moved through the room with the careful attention of a man used to reading palm-leaf manuscripts.

De Lannoy stood to one side, close enough to be useful, far enough not to contaminate the sanctity of the moment. He wore his usual plain coat and carried himself like a man in uniform even when dressed in cloth. The cross he wore under his shirt was invisible, but I had learned that invisible things can still shape a room.

I stood behind De Lannoy, hands at my sides, trying to look like an officer and not like a captured boy who had learned to count.

A minister spoke first, listing problems in the smooth tone of a man who has never been shot at. Grain stores. Temple repairs. A dispute between two nobles about land rights. Complaints from merchants about duties.

Dharma Raja listened without interrupting. When the minister paused, the king asked a small question about numbers. How much rice had been stored in the last harvest. How much had been distributed during the rains. How much silver had been diverted to repair a temple roof.

The minister answered quickly, but the speed had a nervousness to it. Marthanda Varma had punished incompetence with violence. Dharma Raja punished it with attention.

Then Dharma Raja's gaze shifted to De Lannoy.

"How many guns at Udayagiri?" he asked in Malayalam.

De Lannoy answered without hesitation. The number, the calibre, the condition of carriages, the state of powder. His Malayalam was fluent, but his accent remained, a faint roughness in the vowels that reminded everyone he had once been an enemy.

Dharma Raja listened, then looked at me.

For a heartbeat, I felt the old instinct to lower my eyes. In the Company, you do not meet the gaze of men above you unless ordered. In Travancore, you do not meet the gaze of a king unless you want to be remembered.

But Dharma Raja's eyes held mine with calm curiosity.

"You are Pieter," he said.

The sound of my name in his mouth was strange. It made me feel briefly, absurdly, as if I had been recognised as a human being rather than a tool.

"Yes, Your Highness," I replied, in Malayalam.

The king's eyebrows rose slightly. "Your Malayalam is improving."

Heat climbed my neck. I lowered my eyes and bowed, letting the motion answer for me.

Dharma Raja's gaze moved to my hands. The powder stains, the calluses. A scholar's eyes noticing the marks of labour.

"De Lannoy tells me you have a head for numbers," he said.

I could feel De Lannoy's attention on me. Not pressure. Expectation.

"I can count," I said.

The minister looked faintly amused, as if the foreign gunner had spoken too simply in front of a king.

Dharma Raja did not smile, but his eyes warmed by a fraction.

"Then count for me," he said. "Count what it costs to keep a wall standing."

The minister opened his mouth, ready to offer an answer wrapped in polished words.

Dharma Raja raised one hand. The minister stopped.

The king's attention stayed on me.

I swallowed. My mouth tasted of sandalwood and fear.

"Rice," I said slowly. "Powder. Men who are paid on time. Carriages that do not rot. A magazine that stays dry. A fort that does not pretend the monsoon is only rain."

The minister's amusement vanished.

Dharma Raja nodded. "Good. You understand that walls are not stone. They are work."

He turned back to the minister.

"Send twice the usual money for powder and saltpetre to Udayagiri," he said. "I want the magazine full before the next rains."

"Your Highness," the minister began, "the temple renovations-"

Dharma Raja's voice stayed quiet. "The gods will not hold the wall when Mysore comes."

The room went still.

No one had said that name aloud yet. Mysore. It sat in the air like smoke.

Then the king looked away as if he had spoken about weather, not war.

"We will repair the temples," he continued, calm. "We will also repair the guns. Both are duties."

De Lannoy's mouth tightened. It might have been approval.

As we left the chamber, I realised my hands were trembling slightly.

Not from fear of punishment.

From the shock of being asked a question that mattered.

Outside, in the courtyard, the air felt different.

The palace was full of priests and scribes and men who smelled of perfumed oil rather than sweat. The fort was full of men who smelled of powder and damp cloth. I moved between those worlds now, neither fully belonging to either.

De Lannoy walked beside me in silence for a while. His boots made a steady sound on the stone.

When we reached the gate, he spoke.

"He listens," he said.

"Yes," I replied.

"That is his strength," De Lannoy continued. "It is also his danger. A man who listens can be talked into softness."

I thought of the minister's protest, the way he had tried to redirect money to temples, not powder.

"Will he be soft?" I asked.

De Lannoy's eyes lifted toward the northern hills. "The world will decide that for him."

He glanced at me. "And for you."

I did not like how true it sounded.

That night, Lakshmi listened to my account without interrupting.

We sat on the floor in our small house near the fort. A lamp burned in the corner, throwing the room into warm light. Rain ticked on the roof. Outside, frogs sang with the confidence of creatures that had never seen a cannon.

Lakshmi was mending cloth, her needle moving quick and sure. Our children slept behind a hanging cloth, their breathing soft. I could hear Willem's occasional sigh, as if even in sleep he was arguing with the world.

"He is a good man," Lakshmi said when I finished.

"Good does not stop cannonballs," I replied.

Lakshmi did not look up. "No. But good men make fewer enemies."

Marthanda Varma had made enemies as if collecting them was part of his strength. De Lannoy's stories of the prince hunted by his own family came back to me, the man who had survived by becoming a blade.

"He will still have enemies," I said.

Lakshmi tied off the thread and snapped it with her teeth. "Everyone has enemies. The question is whether you make them by accident or by choice."

Her words were simple, but they landed in me like a lesson.

In the Company, we were taught that enemies are expected. In Travancore, I was learning that enemies can also be manufactured, cultivated, fed.

Lakshmi set the cloth down and finally looked at me.

"Are you afraid?" she asked.

I could have lied. I had lied well for years. But Lakshmi had not married me for my lies.

"Yes," I said.

Lakshmi nodded, satisfied.

"Good," she replied. "Fear keeps you awake."

The phrase was so close to De Lannoy's that I almost laughed.

Lakshmi's mouth tightened. "Do not laugh. I have seen men die because they thought fear was shameful. Fear is a tool. Like your powder."

I looked down at my hands, at the stains that never fully washed out.

"The king asked me a question," I said quietly.

Lakshmi's eyes sharpened. "And that surprised you."

"Yes."

"It should," she said. "Marthanda Varma did not ask. He commanded. A man who asks is either weak or wise."

I stared at her. Lakshmi had never seen Marthanda Varma up close. She had only heard stories. Yet she spoke as if she had been in the palace with me.

That was her gift.

She understood people without needing to be told.

"Which is he?" I asked.

Lakshmi shrugged. "Both. Like all men."

She stood, stretched her shoulders, and walked to the hanging cloth that separated the sleeping children from the rest of the house. She pulled it aside and checked their faces, as if touching the future with her eyes.

"If the king is wise," she said without turning, "he will keep you close. He will keep De Lannoy close. He will keep men who know guns close."

"And if he is weak?"

Lakshmi lowered the cloth again and returned to sit beside me.

"Then we will still wake tomorrow," she said. "We will still feed the children. You will still go to the wall. The world does not stop because kings are afraid."

Her calm was not comfort. It was discipline.

I realised then that Lakshmi and De Lannoy had something in common.

They both understood that a kingdom is held by the work no one sings about.

Weeks later, I stood on the Udayagiri ramparts and watched the sea.

The cannon were clean. The powder was dry. The gunners drilled until their arms shook. The wall held its shape against rain and heat because men repaired it constantly, like stitching a wound that refuses to heal.

Below, traders moved along the road carrying pepper and cloth. Children ran between coconut palms. A priest walked toward the fort's small temple with a brass lamp in his hand.

It all looked peaceful, and peace is always a lie told between wars.

To the north, beyond the hills, there were other kingdoms. Other ambitions. Other men who were learning the same arithmetic of force that De Lannoy had taught me.

Hyder Ali was still only a rumour then, a name spoken in whispers, like a disease that has not yet reached your village.

But on that wall, with the sea wind in my face and the smell of powder in my memory, I understood something that the court's hopeful men did not.

An era had ended when Marthanda Varma's pyre was lit.

The new king sat on the throne and spoke of dharma.

And somewhere beyond the hills, the next war was already being built, one disciplined battalion at a time.

The cannons did not care what the king believed.

They waited, silent, for the moment they would be asked to speak again.
