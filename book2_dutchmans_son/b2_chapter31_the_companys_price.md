# Chapter 31: The Company's Price

A gun is honest.

It gives exactly what you give it. Too much powder and it bursts. Too little and it fails. You can measure it. You can predict it. You can respect it.

A ledger pretends to be honest.

It uses numbers to hide intention.

After Pollilur, the English Company's numbers began to walk into Travancore like soldiers.

---

The meeting was held in the same warehouse where I had once watched pepper sacks become ammunition.

Now the warehouse held more than pepper.

It held fear.

Raja Kesavadas stood by the scale again, his face calm, his posture controlled. His clerk waited with palm-leaf boards, ready to write whatever would become the king's obligation.

Across from him sat Mr Fraser, the Company agent, his coat dark, his handkerchief held to his nose as if pepper was still an insult.

Two Company officers stood behind him, young, clean, their faces too confident for men who had just watched a Company column burn at Pollilur.

One of them had a scar on his cheek now.

The narrow-faced lieutenant.

Caspar's handwriting in flesh.

He looked at me when I entered, eyes hard, and then looked away.

Fraser smiled as if nothing had happened.

"Dalawa," he said in Portuguese. "Difficult times."

I translated.

Kesavadas nodded.

"War," he replied. "It makes truth loud."

I translated.

Fraser's smile tightened.

---

Fraser spoke first of help.

The Company would increase powder supply.
The Company would send advisers.
The Company would share intelligence on Mysore movements.

He said each offer as if it were a gift.

Kesavadas listened as if the words were stones being weighed.

When Fraser finished, Kesavadas spoke, calm.

"The Company is generous," he said.

I translated into English as, "The Company is kind."

The same lie, repeated.

Fraser nodded, pleased.

"We do what we can," he said. "Of course, assistance requires certainty."

Certainty.

The new word for chains.

He unfolded papers and tapped a column.

"Travancore must commit to purchase Company powder exclusively," he said. "To avoid delays."

I translated.

Kesavadas did not react.

Fraser continued.

"Travancore must allow a permanent Company office at Padmanabhapuram," he said. "A small staff to facilitate coordination."

I translated.

The Brahmin priest at the edge of the room shifted, displeased. He disliked foreigners in royal air.

Fraser's voice stayed smooth.

"Travancore must permit Company troops to pass through its roads when needed," he said. "To ensure rapid response."

I translated.

Kesavadas' face stayed calm, but I saw his jaw tighten slightly.

Roads.

Once a Company army walks your roads, it begins to believe the roads belong to it.

Fraser looked at Kesavadas as if waiting for gratitude.

Then he spoke the sentence that mattered most.

"Travancore must contribute to the cost," he said.

The clerk's reed paused.

I translated.

Fraser's smile widened.

"Only fairly," he added. "A monthly subsidy. For the advisers. For the troops. For the protection."

Protection.

There it was again, the Company's favourite word for ownership.

I translated, and the Malayalam word tasted like tax.

Kesavadas leaned back slightly.

He did not say no immediately.

That was what frightened me.

Kesavadas was a man who knew the value of refusal.

If he was not refusing, it meant the numbers were doing violence.

---

Kesavadas spoke slowly.

"The Company lost a column at Pollilur," he said.

I translated.

Fraser's smile faltered for a fraction.

Kesavadas continued.

"Travancore held its Lines," he said. "Travancore held them with its own men and its own guns."

I translated.

Fraser's cheeks tightened.

Kesavadas placed his hand on the pepper scale as if grounding himself in something real.

"Why should Travancore pay for Company protection," he asked, "when Company protection could not protect Company men?"

I translated.

Silence filled the warehouse.

The Company officers behind Fraser stiffened. The lieutenant with the scar looked as if he wanted to speak, then remembered he was not allowed to.

Fraser recovered quickly.

"Pollilur was an anomaly," he said.

Anomaly.

The word meant, we will not admit that the world has changed.

Kesavadas nodded as if he accepted the word.

"Anomaly," he repeated.

Then he leaned forward.

"And the rockets?" he asked softly. "Are they also an anomaly?"

I translated.

Fraser's smile held, but it looked strained now.

"Mysore has adopted certain French tricks," he said.

Tricks.

As if innovation was a child's game.

Kesavadas' gaze stayed steady.

"Travancore will buy your powder," he said. "Travancore will listen to your intelligence. Travancore will cooperate when cooperation keeps our people alive."

I translated.

Fraser relaxed, sensing agreement.

Kesavadas continued.

"Travancore will not pay a monthly subsidy," he said. "Travancore will not accept Company troops on our roads without notice. Travancore will not allow a permanent office inside the palace precincts."

I translated, careful, smoothing the hardest edges.

Fraser's face tightened.

Kesavadas lifted one hand.

"However," he said.

Fraser's eyes gleamed.

Kesavadas spoke the word like a man choosing which finger to cut.

"Travancore will allow a Company office in the town," he said. "Outside the palace. A small staff."

I translated.

Fraser nodded, satisfied.

Kesavadas continued, voice calm.

"Travancore will allow your advisers to visit the Lines," he said. "Under escort."

I translated.

Fraser's smile widened.

Kesavadas added the final sentence.

"Travancore will pay for powder in pepper," he said. "At a fair rate. Not your rate."

I translated.

Fraser's smile tightened again.

The negotiation had ended where all negotiations end.

With compromise that feels like loss to both sides.

---

After the meeting, as Fraser gathered his papers and the clerk tied palm leaves into bundles that would become obligations, Kesavadas kept me behind.

The Company men left the warehouse with stiff politeness, their boots careful not to step in pepper dust as if dirt could stain empire.

When the last red wax seal vanished, Kesavadas looked at me.

"You see it," he said, eyes hard.

I nodded.

"They cannot beat Mysore alone," I said quietly. "So they will beat paper instead."

Kesavadas' mouth tightened.

"They will beat us with paper until we thank them for it," he said.

He gestured toward the pepper sacks.

"Every barrel of powder has a price," he continued. "Not in silver. In leverage."

He looked at me, eyes hard.

"You served a Company once," he said. "Tell me this. When a Company offers help, what does it want?"

The question was another test.

I answered with the only honesty that mattered.

"It wants to be needed," I said. "And once it is needed, it wants to be obeyed."

Kesavadas nodded.

"Good," he said. "Then do not let your fort become dependent."

I wanted to laugh.

Powder comes from elsewhere. Lead comes from elsewhere. Saltpetre comes from elsewhere.

Dependency is built into war.

But Kesavadas' point was clear.

Do not let the Company become the only door.

Do not let a wall become a chain.

---

On the ride back to Udayagiri, I passed the refugee camp again.

Children played in mud.
Women cooked rice in dented pots.
Men sat staring north as if their eyes could stop an army.

Fear had made them homeless.

Now paper was about to make the kingdom beholden.

At the fort, Hendrik was drilling gunners.

The rhythm of sponge and ram filled the yard, steady, familiar.

It would have comforted me once.

Now I saw the other rhythm underneath it.

Pepper weighed.
Powder bought.
Obligations written.

The paper was growing heavier than the gun.

And it did not even pretend to be honest.
