# Chapter 13: Caspar's Fire

Powder wants to burn.

It sits in barrels in the dark like a patient animal, waiting for the smallest excuse. A spark. A careless match. A lantern set down too close. A boy who thinks he is immune to consequences because consequences have not yet bitten him.

We spend our lives pretending we control it.

That is what makes men arrogant around guns. A cannon obeys drill. It obeys the sponge and the rammer and the rhythm of commands. It does not show its teeth until it does.

After Mysore began to smell like smoke, De Lannoy ordered the magazine filled.

More powder. More shot. More spare rope. More wedges.

More everything that can kill you if you forget it is waiting.

---

The powder arrived on ox carts from the east, guarded as if it were gold.

In a way, it was.

The barrels were stamped with marks from places I had only seen on maps. Coimbatore. Salem. Names that meant nothing to the men in the yard, but meant routes, and distances, and time. The kind of time you do not have when an army begins to move.

Hendrik supervised the unloading with the cold precision he brought to drill.

"No lanterns near the barrels," he snapped. "No iron nails in the planks. No smoking, not even in the outer yard. If I smell tobacco I will have your tongue cut out."

The men laughed uneasily, because Hendrik was young enough that they still expected threats to be performance.

I did not laugh.

I had seen what powder can do when it stops being patient.

Caspar leaned against the shed post and watched the carts roll in as if it was all beneath him. He rolled a nut between his fingers, quick and idle, and his gaze flicked from barrel to barrel, bored.

That was his way when he was worried.

De Lannoy came down to the yard late, walking slower than he used to, his joints stiff in the damp heat. He watched the new barrels stacked in the magazine corridor and said nothing at first.

Then he looked at me and spoke in Dutch.

"Too much," he said.

He did not mean too much powder.

He meant too much faith in storage. Too much belief that a full magazine is safety rather than risk.

"We need it," I said.

"We need it alive," he replied. "Powder that explodes is not powder. It is funerals."

He turned to the Travancore captain and repeated the instruction in Malayalam, quick and sharp. More guards. No lamps. No careless hands.

Then he left, as if he had said all that could be said.

---

The fire started at midday.

The yard was loud with ordinary work. A carriage wheel being tarred. A gun crew practising sponge and ram without firing. A mule braying as someone tightened a strap too hard.

I was in the shed with a powder table spread before me, trying to calculate how long our increased stock would last if the king doubled the drills again. Numbers steadied me. They always had.

Then a sound cut through the yard, wrong and high.

"Fire!"

The shout came from the magazine corridor.

For a heartbeat, my mind refused it. Fire in a fort is always possible. Fire in a village is ordinary. Fire near a powder magazine is a kind of ending.

I was on my feet before thought caught up.

Outside, men were running toward the magazine, then stopping short as if they had hit a wall.

Smoke curled from the magazine doorway, thin and grey at first, then thicker, darker, carrying the sharp sting of burning cloth and the bitter tang of powder.

A guard stood at the door, eyes wide, hands shaking. He had a bucket in one hand and did not know whether to throw it or run.

Hendrik was there, barking orders, but his voice had a crack in it.

"Back," he shouted. "Back, you fools. Get away from the corridor. Get to the wall, now."

Men froze, caught between obedience and the instinct to stare at disaster.

Someone tried to push past Hendrik toward the door, and Hendrik slammed him back with his forearm.

"Do you want to die here?" he roared. "There will be nothing left of you to bury."

That was when De Lannoy appeared.

He did not run. He did not shout. He came out of the inner yard at a measured pace, crop in hand, his face unreadable.

He looked at the smoke and then at the men, and in that glance he took command.

"Buckets," he said in Malayalam. "Not one. Not two. Fifty. Now."

He pointed the crop at the well.

"Form a chain," he said. "From the well to the door. No running. If you run, you spill. If you spill, you feed the fire."

His voice stayed calm. That calmness steadied the yard more than any shouting could have.

Men moved. Hands grabbed buckets. A line began to form, ragged at first, then tightening as Hendrik and the Travancore captain snapped it into shape.

De Lannoy stepped toward the magazine door.

Hendrik grabbed his arm.

"Father," he said, and for once the word was not hidden behind discipline.

De Lannoy did not look at him. "Let go," he said.

Hendrik's fingers loosened.

De Lannoy walked to the door, stopped, and listened.

That was what made him terrifying. In a moment when every nerve screamed run, he listened, as if he could hear the size of the fire in the sound it made.

Inside the magazine, something crackled.

Not the sharp crack of a gun firing.

The dry hungry crackle of cloth and wood burning.

De Lannoy looked back at me.

"If it reaches the barrels," he said in Dutch, quiet enough that only I heard, "we will not have time to pray."

I nodded. I had already done the arithmetic.

A magazine explosion does not kill men.

It erases them.

---

Caspar pushed through the crowd.

He did not say anything. He did not ask permission. He moved with the sudden focus of a man who has finally found something that makes him feel alive.

Hendrik stepped in front of him.

"Stay back," he said, voice hard. "This is not a joke."

Caspar looked at his brother and smiled, a quick flash of teeth.

"Of course it is not a joke," he said. "That is why it is interesting."

Then he shoved Hendrik aside and headed for the door.

"Caspar!" Hendrik shouted.

De Lannoy's head turned slightly, and for a moment I saw something in his face.

Fear.

Not for himself.

For his son.

Caspar reached the door as the first bucket arrived.

A gunner in the chain thrust it toward him, hands shaking.

Caspar took it and threw it into the doorway without hesitation.

The water hit something inside and hissed.

Smoke billowed out thicker, and Caspar stepped forward into it.

Men shouted. Someone grabbed at his sleeve and missed.

Caspar disappeared into the smoke like a man stepping into a storm.

---

I moved without deciding.

Not into the doorway. I was not brave like Caspar. I was careful like a man who had lived long enough to understand that courage can be waste.

But I moved close enough to see.

Inside the magazine corridor, a stack of empty packing crates had caught fire. The flame was small, contained, but it was licking upward toward the shelves where the new powder barrels had been stacked too close.

The smell was wrong. The wood smelled like ordinary burning. Under it was the sharper smell of spilled powder, a thin trail on the floor that glimmered like black sand.

If the flame found that trail, it would run.

Caspar was on his knees in the smoke, beating at the crates with his hands, slapping flame as if it were an insult.

He should have used cloth. He should have used wet blankets.

He had not thought.

His palms hit the burning wood and he jerked back, a sharp involuntary motion.

Then he hit it again.

He had a bucket beside him now. He scooped water with his bare hands and flung it at the base of the fire, not enough to drown it but enough to slow it.

"Barrels!" he shouted into the corridor, voice hoarse. "Move the barrels. Now. Do not stand there looking stupid."

The men closest to the door hesitated.

Not from cowardice.

From calculation.

Every gunner knows the distance a magazine blast can throw stone. Every man in the yard was doing the same silent math.

If I go in and it explodes, my wife will be a widow and my children will become beggars.

Caspar looked back at them through the smoke, eyes bright.

"If it explodes, you die anyway," he shouted. "You will just die outside like polite men."

That broke something in them.

Two gunners surged forward, cloth wrapped around their hands, and grabbed the nearest powder barrel.

They moved like men carrying a sleeping child, careful and fast at the same time.

Caspar shoved the burning crates away from the spill trail, pushing them with his forearm as if pain was irrelevant.

He caught the trail of powder with a handful of water, turning it into black paste.

The paste did not burn.

The air hissed, thick with steam and smoke.

Outside, the bucket chain began to work properly. Water flowed hand to hand, steady now. Men stopped running. They started obeying.

I watched the fire shrink under water and force, and in that watching I saw something with a clarity that made my stomach tighten.

This was what De Lannoy had seen in me at Colachel.

Not skill.

Not loyalty.

Instinct.

The ability to move when other men freeze.

That ability saves forts.

It also destroys men.

---

The fire died slowly, stubbornly.

Not all of it. Not at first.

One crate flared again when a wet board shifted and exposed a pocket of embers. Caspar slapped it out with his bare hand and made a sound that might have been laughter and might have been pain.

By the time the smoke thinned enough to see the magazine shelves properly, Caspar's hands were red and blistered. The skin on his palms had gone slick in places, as if it had been boiled.

He did not look at his hands.

He looked at the shelves.

The powder barrels were wet. Not soaked, not ruined, but wet enough that Hendrik swore under his breath.

Powder hates water. It clumps. It spoils. A wet magazine is an expensive mistake.

But a blown magazine is a kingdom's death.

De Lannoy stepped into the corridor at last, once the fire was nothing but blackened wood and steam.

He moved slowly, because he was old and because haste in a magazine is how men die.

He looked at the damaged crates, the wet powder trail, the soot on the ceiling.

Then his gaze went to Caspar.

Caspar stood there, chest heaving, smoke in his hair, his hands held slightly away from his body as if he did not trust them.

De Lannoy said nothing for a long moment.

Hendrik started to speak, anger and relief tangled in his voice.

"He went in like a fool," he said. "He could have killed everyone."

Caspar looked at his brother, eyes narrow.

"Yes," he said. "And I did not."

De Lannoy lifted his crop and tapped Hendrik's chest lightly.

"Enough," he said in Malayalam.

He stepped closer to Caspar.

For a moment I expected praise. I expected a father's hand on a son's shoulder. I expected words that might soften Caspar's face and give him a reason to live that was not danger.

De Lannoy did not give him that.

He took Caspar's wrist gently and turned his hand palm up.

The blisters were already rising, pale against red skin.

De Lannoy's mouth tightened.

"You have hands like a gunner," he said, voice quiet. "You must keep them."

Caspar tried to pull his wrist away.

"It is nothing," he said.

De Lannoy held on, firm now.

"It is not nothing," he said.

He released Caspar's wrist and turned to the healer who had arrived, breathless, with cloth and salve.

"Treat him," De Lannoy ordered. "Now."

Then he walked out of the magazine without looking back.

It was the closest thing to tenderness he allowed himself.

---

By evening, the yard smelled of wet ash.

The gunners moved quietly, sobered. Men who had watched death almost happen do not speak loudly for a while. They glance at each other differently. They touch their children harder when they go home.

Hendrik had the damaged powder barrels rolled out to the sun and the seals checked. He had scribes note losses. He had men scrape soot from the ceiling. His mind moved immediately to repair.

Caspar vanished.

That was his pattern too.

He appeared when danger gave him a shape, then disappeared when the shape dissolved and left only feeling behind.

I found him after dark in a shed by the outer wall where the gunners sometimes drank when they wanted to forget they were mortal.

A small lamp burned there, shielded, the flame enclosed. No one would dare open fire in a fort after a day like this.

Caspar sat on an upturned crate with a cup in his good hand.

Arrack.

It smelled of sugar and rot.

He drank as if he had been thirsty his whole life.

When he raised the cup, his burned hand trembled so hard the liquid sloshed.

He noticed my eyes and curled his fingers inward, hiding the tremor.

"Come to lecture me?" he asked, voice too casual.

I sat on another crate and said nothing at first. Smoke still clung to my hair. My throat still tasted of ash.

"You did well," I said finally.

Caspar snorted. "I did not die," he replied. "That is not the same thing."

"It is sometimes the same thing," I said.

He stared at the cup.

"When I ran in," he said quietly, "I did not think of anything. Not my father. Not Hendrik. Not the fort. Not even myself."

He flexed his fingers and winced, quick and involuntary.

"I only thought, this is fire, and I hate it," he said. "Fire takes what it wants."

His voice roughened.

"It took men at Colachel," he continued. "It took our powder. It took my father's sleep. It took my mother's laughter."

His eyes lifted to mine.

"It will take us too," he said. "One day. It always does."

I did not contradict him. Contradiction is cheap comfort.

Caspar drank again, then set the cup down carefully, as if his hand could not be trusted.

"Do not tell my father about the shaking," he said abruptly.

There it was.

Not fear of death.

Fear of being seen as weak.

"He already knows," I said.

Caspar's mouth twisted. "He knows everything. He pretends he does not."

He held his burned hands in the lamplight, studying the blisters as if they belonged to someone else.

"Hendrik thinks discipline is a wall," he said. "He thinks if he builds it high enough, nothing gets in."

He looked up again, the restlessness back in his eyes.

"I think discipline is just a way to die neatly," he said.

He laughed once, sharp and bitter.

"And I do not want to die neatly," he said. "If I die, I want it to mean something."

His burned fingers clenched, then loosened.

In that movement I saw the cost of his courage.

The fire had not killed him.

It had entered him.

---

When I left the shed, the fort was quiet.

The stars were sharp above the wall, cold and indifferent. The backwater below the fort lay black and still.

In the gun yard, the magazine door stood closed, and for the first time in my life I felt grateful for a heavy wooden door.

I went home and found Lakshmi awake, sitting in the doorway with a lamp beside her, waiting.

She touched my hair and smelled the smoke.

"Fire," she said.

I nodded.

Lakshmi's gaze went to my hands, checking without asking.

"Not you," she murmured.

"Caspar," I said.

Lakshmi's mouth tightened. "The reckless one."

"The brave one," I replied.

Lakshmi looked at me, and in her eyes I saw something that made my chest feel tight.

Pity.

Not for Caspar's burns.

For the hunger beneath them.

"Bravery is expensive," she said quietly. "It always demands payment."

She reached for my hand and held it, steady.

"Make sure he does not pay with his whole life," she added.

Outside, the fort's walls held the night.

Inside them, we were storing powder and pretending we controlled fire.
