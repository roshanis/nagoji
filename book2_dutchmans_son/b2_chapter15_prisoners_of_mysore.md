# Chapter 15: Prisoners of Mysore

I had been a prisoner once.

That memory never left. It sat behind my eyes like smoke, thin most days, thicker when I was tired, choking when I smelled wet rope or heard men speak Dutch in anger.

Prisoner is a word that sounds simple.

In truth it is a room inside the mind. It is the knowledge that your body is no longer yours. It is the humiliation of waiting for someone else to decide whether you are useful.

When the Mysorean prisoners were brought into Udayagiri, I understood them too well.

---

They came at dusk, escorted by Travancore cavalry, their hands tied with coir rope.

There were five of them, and one was dead before he reached the gate. His head lolled on his chest, chin slick with blood. The rope kept him upright as if the fort did not know what to do with a corpse that still walked.

The living four did not speak.

That was what struck me first.

Bandits talk. They curse. They brag. They spit defiance because defiance costs nothing when you have already decided you will die.

These men held their silence like a discipline.

They wore cloth stained with travel and sweat, but their belts were tight, their knots clean. Their hair was bound. Their beards were trimmed. One man, older than the rest, stood with his shoulders back even with rope biting his wrists. His gaze moved over the fort walls with the same attention a gunner gives a battery.

He was measuring.

Hendrik met them in the yard with a face like stone.

"Where were they taken?" he asked the escort captain.

"Near the northern road," the captain replied. "Scouts. Rocket men."

The word rocket made the gunners in the yard mutter. Men turned their heads away as if the prisoners carried fire in their mouths.

The older prisoner heard the word in Malayalam and his eyes sharpened. He did not flinch. He did not look ashamed.

He looked proud.

De Lannoy arrived late, moving slowly, his limp worse in the evening damp. He looked at the prisoners as if they were cannon to be evaluated.

Then he spoke to me in Dutch.

"Question them," he said. "Not with shouting. With listening."

He turned to Hendrik and spoke in Malayalam.

"Feed them," he ordered. "Water first."

Hendrik's mouth tightened. He wanted to punish. He wanted the fort to feel in control. Feeding prisoners felt like softness.

De Lannoy gave him a look that ended the argument.

Hendrik snapped an order. A bucket of water was brought.

The prisoners watched it as if it might be poison.

I stepped forward with a ladle and held it out to the older man first.

He hesitated, then drank, slow and careful.

When he finished, he looked at me.

"Parangi," he said in a low voice.

The word again.

Foreigner.

Outsider.

He said it without contempt, almost with interest, as if he was trying to understand what I was.

"Yes," I replied in Malayalam. "And you are Mysore."

His mouth twitched slightly. "We are Hyder Sahib's men," he said.

Hyder.

Hyder was not a king, not by blood, not by old law. Yet his soldiers spoke his name as if it made him inevitable.

---

We took them into the shed, away from the yard's staring eyes.

The shed was my refuge and my prison both. It held maps, range tables, powder records. It held the quiet work of preparation. It also held the truth that preparation is never enough.

The prisoners were made to sit on the floor.

The dead man was laid outside.

The older prisoner watched me as I sat opposite him on a low stool. His wrists were still tied, but his posture stayed straight.

"Your name," I said.

He hesitated, then answered.

"Abdul Karim," he said. "*Havildar*."

Sergeant.

A man who makes other men obey.

That explained the straight back.

"How long have you served?" I asked.

"Since I had hair on my face," he replied.

He glanced at my coat, at the way I held myself.

"And you?" he asked. "How long have you served your king?"

It was not a question meant for politeness. It was a probe.

I answered carefully.

"Long enough," I said.

His eyes narrowed. He understood evasion. Sergeants live on it.

"Why were you on our road?" I asked, shifting him back.

Abdul Karim looked at the floor as if deciding which truth to offer.

"We were watching," he said. "Hyder Sahib wants to know where powder moves."

The simplicity of it chilled me.

Not temples.
Not plunder.

Powder.

I thought of the pepper warehouse and Fraser's papers.

Every man with power was watching the same thing.

---

"Tell me about your army," I said.

One of the younger prisoners spat, small and angry. Abdul Karim shot him a glance that shut him up.

"Why should we tell you anything?" the younger man snapped in Malayalam. His accent was northern, rougher, not coastal.

Abdul Karim spoke without looking at him. "Because we are hungry," he said. "Because we are alive. Because talk is lighter than rope."

He looked back at me.

"Ask," he said.

So I did.

"Who trains you?" I asked.

Abdul Karim's eyes flicked sideways, as if checking whether any of his men would be shamed by the answer.

"Frenchmen," he said finally.

Hendrik had told me that word would come sooner or later. French officers drifted through Indian courts like smoke. They taught drill and demanded pay. They called it honour when it suited them and called it necessity when it did not.

I kept my face still.

"How?" I asked.

Abdul Karim leaned forward slightly, as if the question pleased him.

"They make us stand in lines until our legs stop being ours," he said. "They make us load and fire until our hands move without thought. They beat men for looking away. They beat men for breathing wrong. They beat men until discipline enters the bones."

He said it without complaint.

He said it like a man describing a forge.

"Volleys," he continued. "Not men firing when they feel brave. Whole ranks, together. One sound. One smoke. Then bayonet."

Bayonet again.

The younger prisoner looked away. Bayonets are close work. They leave no room for romance.

"We were told Indians cannot stand in line," Abdul Karim said, and for the first time I heard contempt in his voice. "We were told we would run when cannon fired."

He lifted his bound hands slightly.

"We stand," he said. "We do not run."

He looked at me as if daring me to deny it.

I did not.

---

"And the rockets?" I asked.

The shed seemed to tighten.

One of the prisoners, a thin man with burn scars on his forearm, swallowed hard. His eyes went distant, as if he could smell smoke that was not there.

Abdul Karim nodded toward him.

"He is a rocket man," he said. "Ask him."

I shifted my gaze to the thin man.

"Your name?" I asked.

"Sadiq," he murmured.

"How are they used?" I asked.

Sadiq licked his lips. "To break men," he said.

Abdul Karim watched him, face unreadable.

Sadiq continued, voice low.

"Rockets are not guns," he said. "Guns are straight. Rockets are angry."

He held up his scarred forearm.

"They scream," he said. "They make horses forget training. They make men look up."

He looked at me, and I saw something like pride fighting something like fear.

"We do not aim for one man," he said. "We aim for where men stand close. We aim for neatness."

Neatness.

The word landed in me like a stone.

"How many in a team?" I asked.

"Ten," Sadiq said. "Sometimes more. An officer. Men to carry. Men to light. Men to fetch new tubes."

There it was.

Doctrine.

Not a novelty.

A system.

"How far do they fly?" I asked.

Sadiq shrugged slightly. "Far enough," he said. "Sometimes they go where we want. Sometimes they go where God wants."

He paused.

"But even when they miss," he added, "they make men move."

That was the heart of it.

Mysore did not need accuracy to win.

It needed disruption.

---

I turned back to Abdul Karim.

"And your cavalry?" I asked.

Abdul Karim's mouth tightened in a way that looked almost like affection.

"Our cavalry is not for showing," he said. "Not for charging and dying like heroes."

He glanced toward the window slit, toward the yard where Travancore horsemen were untying their mounts.

"We wheel," he said. "We strike, we pull away, we strike again. We do not waste horses."

He said it as if wasting horses was a sin.

I thought of the old stories of Maratha charges, of glory measured in speed and blood. Abdul Karim spoke like a man who measured glory in survival.

Hyder's army, in his telling, was not a collection of brave men.

It was a machine.

---

When I had asked what I could, I sat back and let silence fill the shed.

Silence is useful.

Men talk to fill it.

Abdul Karim watched me, then spoke without being prompted.

"You are not Dutch," he said.

The statement landed in me like a slap.

"I was born Dutch," I replied.

He shook his head slightly. "Dutch men do not sit in this fort," he said. "Dutch men sit behind water and papers. They do not smell powder."

His gaze held mine.

"You are a gunner," he said. "That is your country now."

For a moment I could not breathe properly.

He had said it so simply, as if identity was a function, not a faith.

He glanced toward the door where the dead man lay outside.

"He died because we were slow," Abdul Karim said quietly. "Hyder Sahib will punish our officer for it."

"Punish?" I repeated.

Abdul Karim nodded. "A man who fails is removed," he said. "An army that is not feared is not an army."

I thought of Travancore, where failure could mean a whipping, or exile, or Marthanda Varma's temper in the old days. De Lannoy had built discipline here with fear too, but there were limits to it. Travancore still remembered that soldiers were men, not coins.

Mysore, in Abdul Karim's voice, sounded different.

It sounded hungry.

---

We returned the prisoners to a guarded room with water and rice.

Hendrik watched them go with a face that wanted violence.

"They speak too freely," he muttered in Dutch. "They should be made to fear."

De Lannoy, who had been listening from the doorway without making himself known, stepped forward.

"They already fear," he said. "Not you."

Hendrik stiffened.

De Lannoy's gaze moved to the yard, to the walls, to the distant trees beyond the ditch.

"They fear the man who trained them," he said. "That is why they are dangerous."

He looked at me.

"Write what you heard," he ordered. "Then burn nothing."

It was his way of saying, do not soothe yourself with belief.

That night I wrote until my hand cramped.

Infantry drill. Volley rhythm. Bayonet work.
Rocket teams. Ten men. Aim for neatness.
Cavalry wheel and strike.

I wrote it in Dutch, because Dutch was the language of my old Company's account books, and I could not stop myself from treating enemy doctrine like an inventory.

When I finished, I sat in the dark shed and listened to the fort settle into night.

In the distance, beyond the trees, the world was quiet.

Quiet is always temporary.

Abdul Karim's words stayed with me.

You are a gunner. That is your country now.

If that was true, then Mysore was about to invade my country.
