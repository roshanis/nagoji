# Chapter 5: Lakshmi

I did not marry for love at first.

That is a hard thing to admit, because it makes the heart sound like an account book. But I was a man trained by a company that believed everything could be measured, and I had been remade by a kingdom that believed everything could be used. I learned early that survival has its own kinds of intimacy.

When Lakshmi entered my life, I noticed her the way I noticed a new battery on the wall. Not with romance, but with attention. Something had changed in the fort's pattern, and a man who lives by pattern learns to look closely.

---

I first saw her in the gun yard after a mistake.

It was not my mistake. It belonged to a boy who had been too eager to prove himself and too careless with powder. The gun had cracked, the crew had scattered, and a man had left the yard with his arm wrapped in cloth soaked through with blood.

The injured gunner's name was Kelu. He was a Nair like most of the fort's soldiers, quick-tempered and proud. I had never spoken to him beyond the words of drill. He was one of the men who watched me with narrowed eyes, who never laughed when the other gunners joked about my accent.

When the gun cracked, Kelu did not run. He grabbed the trail as if his body could hold iron steady. The recoil tore him anyway. He screamed once, loud enough to silence the whole yard, and then clamped his teeth together so his pride would not spill out again.

They carried him to a small room near the magazine, where injuries were cleaned if the gods were kind and men died if they were not.

De Lannoy put me back to work immediately. He always did. When blood is on the ground, the first duty is to make sure there is no more.

"Cover the powder," he snapped in Malayalam. "Move the barrels. Check the vents. Now."

I obeyed, hands moving fast, mind running ahead through consequences. If the cracked gun had thrown sparks into the open charges, the yard would have become a butcher's stall.

When the danger was contained, I went to the doorway of the injury room, drawn by a sound I did not recognise at first.

It was not prayer. It was not sobbing. It was not the low animal moan men make when pain has hollowed them out.

It was singing.

Low, rhythmic, almost a murmur. A woman's voice, steady as a drumbeat, cutting through the stink of blood and sweat.

Inside, Lakshmi knelt beside Kelu.

She was washing his wound with boiled water that had cooled enough not to scald. Her hands were quick and sure. She did not flinch when Kelu jerked. She did not scold him. She simply held his forearm with one hand and poured with the other, and kept singing under her breath as if the song was a rope that could keep a man from falling into the dark.

Kelu's face was grey with pain. When she looked up at him, he swallowed hard and blinked, like a boy pretending he had not nearly died.

She spoke to him in a tone I had never heard in the fort. Not an officer's command. Not a man's brag. Not a priest's instruction.

A mother's tone.

Kelu muttered something, bitter. I caught only one word: *Parangi*.

Foreigner.

Lakshmi's eyes flicked toward the doorway.

They found me at once.

I had learned not to meet men's eyes too directly. In the Company that could be read as insolence, and in Travancore it could be read as challenge. But Lakshmi did not have a soldier's habit of avoiding what was in front of her. Her gaze held mine with unembarrassed clarity.

Her forehead had a small mark of sandal paste. Her hair was oiled and braided, the braid looped over her shoulder. Her blouse was plain, her sari darkened by rain and work. She wore no jewellery except a thin chain around her neck and a pair of brass bangles that clicked softly as she moved.

In that moment she looked at me the way De Lannoy looked at a gun.

Not judgment. Assessment.

She said something to Kelu, sharp enough that he shut his mouth. Then she returned her attention to the wound, still singing.

I stood at the doorway longer than I should have, ashamed of my own curiosity. Then I turned and went back to the yard.

For the rest of the day, the singing stayed in my head.

---

After that, I saw her everywhere.

Not because she had suddenly become important to the fort, but because my eyes had learned to find her. She came with baskets of bandages and small jars of ointment. She came when a fever swept through the barracks after the rains. She came when a man's hand was crushed by a wheel, when a boy burned his fingers on a match, when an officer's wife gave birth too early and there was nothing to be done but hold the infant and wait for the tiny chest to stop moving.

She did not belong to the fort. She was not a soldier's wife, not yet. She was from a Nair household in the villages near Udayagiri, a family that supplied rice and coconut oil and men for the king's service. Her uncle had a minor post in the fort administration. Her brother, Kelu, served on the guns.

That is how she arrived, through blood and duty, not through romance.

I began to learn her habits.

She never walked quickly unless someone was dying. She never wasted words on men who wanted pity. She used humour the way a surgeon uses a blade, sparingly and only when it would do more good than harm. When the fort's gossip women whispered that she was too bold, she let them whisper and kept working.

Once, when a young gunner tried to flirt with her in crude Malayalam, she flicked his ear hard enough to make him yelp, then handed him a bucket and told him to scrub the floor where men had vomited. The other gunners laughed. The young gunner blushed and scrubbed.

I watched and found myself almost smiling.

It frightened me. Smiling had been rare since Colachel.

---

We did not speak properly for months.

My Malayalam was still clumsy, full of Dutch angles. Lakshmi understood my words but pretended not to when she wanted to punish my pride. If I asked for water, she would hand me a cloth and tell me to wipe my own sweat first. If I tried to thank her, she would tilt her head and ask, too sweetly, whether foreign tongues had no better phrases.

When she spoke Dutch, it was worse. Her mouth refused the hard consonants. She made the words sound like they had been softened in water.

"Pieter," she would say, and it would come out like "Pitar".

The other gunners mocked me for it. Lakshmi ignored them.

One afternoon, after drill, I found her alone in the shade by the well, washing blood from cloth. The water turned pink and then clear again as she wrung and rinsed and wrung.

I hesitated at the edge of the shade, unsure whether approaching her would be another kind of arrogance.

Lakshmi glanced up. "If you have come to stare, stare properly," she said. "Do not hover like a guilty dog."

The words stung. The tone made them bearable.

I stepped closer.

She dipped the cloth again and wrung it out. "You load a gun like a man who has decided he will not die," she said without looking at me.

The words snagged in my chest. I watched the pink water spiral in the bucket and said the first honest thing that came.

"I have already died once," I said. "At Colachel."

Lakshmi looked up then, and for a moment the fort disappeared. There was only her gaze and the wet cloth in her hands and the sound of the well rope creaking.

"Men who die once die twice," she said. "The first time in battle, the second time when they stop living."

It was not a proverb I had heard before. It might have been one she invented on the spot. Lakshmi was capable of that. She could make wisdom the way she made bandages, out of what was available.

"Are you living, Pieter?" she asked.

The question landed harder than it should have. It forced my mind away from numbers and powder tables and back into the raw, unfinished parts of myself.

My mouth opened and nothing came. Lakshmi shrugged, as if the silence was answer enough.

She went back to washing.

I stood beside her and, without thinking, reached for one of the cloths and began to wring it out.

Lakshmi's eyes flicked to my hands.

"Foreign hands are useful too," she said.

That was the first kindness she ever gave me, and she disguised it as an insult.

I understood then that I would not survive this land by becoming local. I would survive it by being useful, by learning its rhythms, by letting it reshape me without surrendering entirely.

Lakshmi understood that before I did.

---

The marriage did not begin with a proposal. It began with a negotiation.

It came to me through De Lannoy, as most important things in my life did.

He called me to his room one evening when the monsoon clouds sat low and the fort smelled of damp stone. He did not offer toddy. When De Lannoy did not offer toddy, it meant the conversation was not friendly.

"You need roots," he said.

I stared at him. "I have a gun crew."

De Lannoy's expression did not change. "You have a gun crew today. Tomorrow you have a different crew. Men die. Men transfer. Men betray. Roots are not soldiers."

"What are roots, then?" I asked, irritated.

De Lannoy picked up a small paper from his desk and slid it toward me.

It was written in Malayalam, with a few Dutch names inserted like foreign bodies in a wound.

I recognised my own name.

"You have been here five years," De Lannoy said. "You are useful. The king will not kill you. That does not mean this land will accept you. Not fully."

His finger tapped the paper.

"There are men in the court who believe you remain a danger because you have no ties. No family, no house, no obligations that can be used to keep you in line. A foreign gunner with no chains is still a foreign gunner."

I felt my mouth go dry. "So they want to put me in chains."

De Lannoy nodded. "Yes. Softer chains."

I looked down at the paper again. "What is this?"

"A marriage offer," De Lannoy said.

I looked up sharply. "To whom?"

De Lannoy's eyes were flat. "Lakshmi."

The name hit me like a cannon recoil. Not because I had been secretly dreaming of her, but because I had not allowed myself to imagine she could belong to me. Lakshmi was local in a way I would never be. She walked into the fort without fear. She spoke to men like they were children and made them obey. She carried herself as if she had always belonged here.

I was still a Dutch boy in my head, smelling salt wind and smoke.

"Her family will never accept it," I said immediately.

"Her family has already been speaking to Ramayyan," De Lannoy replied. "They accept it enough to consider it."

That should have been comforting. It was not. It made the offer feel less like romance and more like strategy.

"And what do they want in return?" I asked.

De Lannoy gave a small, almost invisible smile. "They want you to convert."

There it was. The price.

I felt something hot rise in my chest. Anger, yes. Also fear. Also the old stubborn pride of a boy who had nothing left except the last few things he could still refuse.

"No," I said.

De Lannoy watched me. "You are Lutheran. Is that still true?"

The question was not about doctrine. It was about identity.

I traced the cross on my chest when afraid. The prayers no longer came easily. The fort smelled of oil and damp paper, not churches and candles.

"I do not know what I am," I said.

De Lannoy nodded. "Good. That is honest."

He leaned forward slightly. "But you know what you are not. You are not Hindu. Do not become Hindu on paper because a family wants a clean story. Clean stories are for priests. Soldiers live in mud."

I stared at him. De Lannoy was Catholic. He had kept his chapel and his Latin and his rosary in a king's fort. He understood the stubbornness of faith even when faith was frayed.

"If I refuse," I said, "the marriage is dead."

"Not necessarily," De Lannoy replied. "Lakshmi is not her uncle. She is not her priest. She is herself."

His voice softened, just a fraction.

"Go and speak to her," he said. "Not like an officer. Like a man."

---

I found Lakshmi by the well again, because the well was where the fort's masks came off. Men who swaggered on the wall came to the well to drink like animals. Women who watched their mouths in halls came to the well to mutter truths into water.

Lakshmi was tying up bundles of cloth, her hands moving quick and efficient. She glanced up when I approached.

"If you have come to bleed, do it somewhere else," she said.

I swallowed. My tongue felt thick.

"I have come because De Lannoy sent me," I said.

Lakshmi's hands paused. Her eyes narrowed slightly. "So. It is time."

The directness made me dizzy.

"You know?" I asked.

Lakshmi tied the last knot and set the bundle down. "The fort gossips as well as it drills," she said. "Yes, I know. My uncle thinks it will make our family safer. The priests think it will make my household cleaner. Your Dutch pride thinks it will make you less foreign."

She stepped closer, close enough that I could smell the coconut oil in her hair.

"I do not care what they think," she said.

The words should have been reassuring. They were not. They sounded like a blade being drawn.

"What do you care about?" I asked.

Lakshmi looked at my face as if reading it. Then her gaze dropped to my hands, the calluses from rope and iron, the powder stains that never fully washed out.

"I care that you do not lie," she said. "If you marry me and pretend to be Hindu, you will be lying every day. You will be lying to my mother, to my gods, to your own ghosts. And you will resent me for it."

I felt the truth of it settle in my bones.

"I will not convert," I said.

Lakshmi nodded. "Good."

I blinked, surprised. "Good?"

"Good," she repeated. "Let them be angry. Anger is honest. Better than pretending."

She picked up the bundle again and started walking toward the infirmary.

I followed without thinking. "Then why marry me?"

Lakshmi did not look back. "Because I have watched you for years," she said. "I have watched you become useful. I have watched you stop flinching when men call you *Parangi*. I have watched you measure powder like prayer. I have watched you carry wounded men without making speeches about mercy."

She paused at the doorway and finally looked at me.

"And I have watched you be alone," she said. "Alone is a dangerous way to live. Alone men break. Alone men become cruel."

The words landed softly and still hurt.

"If you marry me," Lakshmi continued, "you will not be alone. You will be something else. Not Dutch. Not Nair. Something that will make everyone uncomfortable."

Her mouth tightened. It might have been amusement.

"That suits me," she said.

---

The ceremony was small, because large ceremonies are for people who belong.

Lakshmi's uncle wanted Brahmin priests. The priests wanted me to take a Hindu name and submit to the rituals of cleansing. De Lannoy wanted to laugh at them all and drink toddy in his chapel.

In the end it was Lakshmi who decided.

We stood in her family's courtyard under a grey morning sky. A lamp burned in a niche. A few elders watched with faces set hard against disapproval. Kelu stood nearby, his arm still stiff, his eyes unreadable.

I had expected him to object. He had called me *Parangi* with contempt. He had watched me in the gun yard with the suspicion men reserve for dogs that might bite. But when Lakshmi told him she would marry me, he had said only: "You have decided." Not a question. Not approval. Just acknowledgment that his sister was not a woman who could be told what to do.

Now he stood at the edge of the courtyard, neither blessing nor cursing. His silence was the closest thing to acceptance I would receive from her blood.

Lakshmi's mother did not speak to me. She looked past me as if I was a pole holding up a roof.

Lakshmi, however, looked at me as if she had chosen me deliberately.

An elder woman placed a cloth in Lakshmi's hands and another in mine. There were words spoken, not Sanskrit, not Dutch, but Malayalam, practical and direct. Promises, obligations, warnings. No one pretended it was pure. No one pretended it was blessed by every god in the land.

Lakshmi's uncle muttered that the priests would not approve. Lakshmi replied, calmly, that priests approve of whatever keeps them fed.

I did not understand every word, but I understood enough.

At the end, Lakshmi took my hand.

Her fingers were warm and dry. Not a soldier's hand. Not soft either. A hand that had wrung blood from cloth and held feverish children and steadied men who wanted to die.

She squeezed once.

That was our marriage.

No conversion. No new name. No cleansing.

Only a decision made in full knowledge of what it would cost.

---

The first weeks after, the fort watched us the way it watched the sea.

Some men were openly contemptuous. A Dutch gunner with a Nair wife, as if the world had turned upside down. Some women whispered that Lakshmi had ruined herself. Some priests refused to take offerings from our household. Some officers smiled too politely.

De Lannoy treated it as nothing. He continued to drill my crew. He continued to punish carelessness. He continued to pray in his chapel as if the world could talk itself hoarse outside the door.

One evening, after drill, he found me standing by the wall staring out at the wet green hills.

"Do you regret it?" he asked.

I saw Lakshmi in our small house near the fort, lighting a lamp, humming under her breath as she boiled rice for our evening meal. Her voice cut through pain and made men listen.

"No," I said.

De Lannoy nodded. "Good. Do not seek forgiveness, Pieter. Seek usefulness. Forgiveness is for priests. Usefulness keeps walls standing."

He walked away, leaving me with the sound of his boots on stone.

That night, Lakshmi sat beside me and spoke of nothing important. The price of rice. The new boy in the gun crew who could not count. Kelu's stubborn refusal to rest his arm.

In the middle of it, she reached up and touched my chest, where a cross hung under my shirt.

Her fingers paused, gentle.

"Does your god mind?" she asked.

I opened my mouth and realised I did not have an answer.

Lakshmi's hand dropped.

"Mine do not mind," she said. "They have seen worse men than you."

It was the closest thing to blessing I had ever been given.

In the weeks that followed, I found myself still tracing the cross when afraid, but with less desperation. The gesture no longer felt like a plea for rescue. It felt like a memory of who I had been, carried quietly into the person I was becoming.

Lakshmi did not ask me to stop.

She only asked me not to lie.

That was the first real vow I ever learned how to keep.
