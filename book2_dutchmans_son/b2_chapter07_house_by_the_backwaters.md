# Chapter 7: House by the Backwaters

In the mornings, before the fort began to shout, the backwaters were quiet enough to hear fish breathe.

Lakshmi would wake first, as she always did. She moved through the house with the soft confidence of someone who knows exactly where each object belongs. She lit the lamp, boiled rice water, checked the children's faces for fever, and stepped outside to look at the sky as if the clouds could be interrogated into honesty.

I woke later, to the smell of ginger and smoke and damp earth. For a moment, half asleep, I would forget where I was. Not Batavia. Not Ceylon. Not the sand of Colachel. This green place that had swallowed me and taught me to count in its language.

Then I would hear the fort's morning gun, a single shot fired not in anger but in discipline, and memory would return like a blade sliding into its sheath.

I would wash, strap on my sword, and become Captain Pieter again, the foreign gunner who understood the king's walls.

But in the morning, in our small house by the water, I was only a husband and a father, and those roles frightened me more than cannon ever had.

---

Willem asked his question on a day when the air smelled of pepper.

Merchants had laid out black peppercorns to dry on mats near the road, and the wind carried their sharp scent into everything. It clung to cloth and hair. It sat at the back of the throat like a warning.

Willem was eleven now. Old enough to begin serious training. Old enough to notice the way men looked at our household, the way their eyes slid from my face to Lakshmi's and then away as if avoiding an infection.

He sat on the threshold with a wooden stick in his hands, carving at it with his knife the way I carved at problems when I did not yet know how to think them through.

Lakshmi was inside, grinding spices. The stone made a steady sound, a rhythm that had nothing to do with war.

Willem did not look up when he spoke.

"Am I Dutch?" he asked.

The question was simple. It was also impossible.

I stood in the courtyard with my boots half on, one foot bare on the packed earth, the other trapped in leather. I had been about to leave for drill. The fort would not wait for a man's private crisis.

Still, I did not move.

"Why do you ask that?" I said.

Willem scraped his knife along the stick again. "The boys at the fort call me *Parangi kutty*," he said. "Foreign boy. When they are angry they call me worse things. When they are feeling kind, they ask me to say Dutch words so they can laugh at my mouth."

I felt heat rise under my collar.

"Who?" I demanded.

Willem shrugged, trying to look indifferent. It did not work. Pride and hurt showed through his face the way a bruise shows under skin.

"Everyone," he said.

Lakshmi's grinding stopped.

She appeared in the doorway, wiping her hands on her sari, her eyes sharp.

"Names do not matter," she said at once, too quickly. A lie spoken out of fear for her child.

Willem looked at her, then back at me. "They matter to them," he said. "They matter to me."

I crouched beside him, ignoring the way my knees complained. I was still young enough to move quickly, but not young enough to do it without consequence.

"You are Willem," I said. "You are my son. You are your mother's son. You belong to her people by blood and to me by choice."

Willem frowned. "That is not an answer."

He was right. It was a sentence designed to sound wise while avoiding the edge.

Lakshmi came closer. She sat on the threshold beside Willem and touched his hair, smoothing it back.

"You are Travancorean," she said. "This is your land. Your tongue is Malayalam. Your bones will be buried here."

Willem turned his head slightly, as if resisting comfort.

"Then why do they call me foreign?" he asked.

Lakshmi looked at me. Her eyes held accusation, not against me, but against the world.

I understood then that this was the price we had agreed to pay without naming it.

No conversion. No clean story. No priest's blessing that could make people forget what they saw.

We had chosen the in-between, and our children would live there too.

"Because your face reminds them that the world is larger than they want to admit," I said quietly. "Because some men need to make others small so they can feel safe."

Willem stared at me, processing. Then he asked the question that cut closer.

"Do you want me to be Dutch?" he said.

The pepper wind blew through the courtyard. Somewhere in the distance, a conch shell sounded near a temple.

I thought of Batavia, of my father speaking of Amsterdam as if it was paradise, of my mother humming songs that were not Dutch, of the Company ships that smelled of tar and sweat and ambition.

I thought of the prison straw under my cheek after Colachel.

I thought of De Lannoy's voice: war is arithmetic.

And I thought of Lakshmi's hand on my chest the night we married, touching the cross under my shirt without flinching.

"I do not want you to belong to a place you have never seen," I said. "I want you to belong to yourself."

Willem frowned, unsatisfied, but the sharpness in his shoulders eased slightly. Children accept imperfect answers because they must.

Lakshmi stood and picked up the grinding stone again with unnecessary force, as if crushing spice could crush the world's cruelty.

"Eat," she told Willem. "Then go to your training. If boys call you foreign, make them regret wasting breath."

Willem's mouth tightened into something like a smile. He rose and went inside.

I remained crouched for a moment, listening to the spice stone grind, listening to my own blood.

The fort's drumbeat began in the distance.

The day would not pause for a father's uncertainty.

---

I went to the fort as usual, but Willem's question sat in my mind like an unspent charge.

Gunnery drills require attention. A moment of distraction can kill a crew. I forced my mind onto numbers, onto angles, onto the clean logic of iron.

Still, as the men loaded and fired, I kept seeing my son's face.

Am I Dutch?

At midday, De Lannoy sent for me.

It was not unusual. He always had something to correct, some habit to break, some calculation to refine. I expected a lecture about powder storage or crew discipline.

Instead, he offered me a cup of coffee.

Coffee was still new in these lands then, a bitter drink that merchants prized and priests condemned as an indulgence. De Lannoy drank it without apology. He had never cared much about priests.

"Sit," he said.

I sat.

De Lannoy watched me over the rim of his cup. "You look like a man who has misfired and is waiting for the barrel to burst," he said.

I hesitated, then realised there was no point in hiding. De Lannoy knew the fort's gossip before it formed.

"My son asked me if he is Dutch," I said.

De Lannoy's eyes softened slightly. Not sympathy. Recognition.

"And what did you tell him?"

"That he is himself," I replied.

De Lannoy snorted. "That is the answer of a man who wants to sound wise and feels foolish."

I felt irritation flare. Then I realised he was right.

De Lannoy set his cup down.

"Bring your son here one day," he said. "Let him see my wife. Let him see my house."

I blinked, surprised.

De Lannoy rarely spoke of his home life. It existed, but he kept it separate from the fort the way he kept his chapel separate from the king's rituals.

"Why?" I asked.

De Lannoy looked toward the small chapel door. "Because he should understand that belonging is not granted by priests," he said. "It is carved out, like a gun embrasure, against resistance."

He stood. "Come," he said. "Now."

---

De Lannoy's house sat near the fort, close enough that he could reach the walls quickly, far enough that the sound of drill did not enter every room.

It was larger than mine, because De Lannoy had power in a way I did not. It was also strangely plain, as if he did not trust comfort.

Margaret met us at the doorway.

She was not young any longer. The sun of this coast had darkened her skin, and the years had carved faint lines at the corners of her eyes. She wore a sari, not European dress, but around her neck a small cross rested against her collarbone.

She looked at me once, then at De Lannoy.

"You have brought your shadow home," she said in Portuguese.

De Lannoy replied in the same language, his mouth still shaped by Europe even after years of Malayalam. "He is not my shadow. He is his own problem."

Margaret's eyes flicked to mine. "You hear that?" she asked, amused. "Even in his own house he pretends he is alone."

De Lannoy ignored the comment and walked inside.

Margaret gestured for me to follow.

The house smelled of beeswax and old wood and something sweet simmering on a fire. In one corner, a small altar held a cross and a candle. In another, a lamp burned before a small image of a local deity, because Margaret had grown up among different faiths and had learned not to insult the land that fed her.

It was the first place I had seen that held both without pretending they were the same.

Margaret noticed my gaze.

"You look relieved," she said.

"I did not expect this," I admitted.

Margaret's mouth tightened into a smile that held no softness.

"My father did not expect it either," she said.

She poured toddy into small cups and handed one to me. The drink was sharp, sweet, and a little sour, like every compromise in this kingdom.

"He refused De Lannoy at first," Margaret said, as casually as if discussing weather. "A defector. A Frenchman. Disgraced. A man who turned his coat and served a Hindu king. My father said my blood would be polluted by shame."

De Lannoy's voice came from the back room, dry. "He said worse than that."

Margaret laughed. "Yes. He did. In three languages."

She sat on a low bench and looked at me with sudden seriousness.

"When the king heard," she continued, "he was ready to march on Anchuthengu and burn the English factory down around my father's account books. That is what Marthanda Varma was like. He did not separate private insult from public authority. If someone refused what he wanted, he made refusal dangerous."

I remembered De Lannoy's words on the day of the king's death. He would have marched for a marriage.

Margaret's eyes hardened as she spoke.

"The ministers talked him down," she said. "They told him it would anger the Europeans, complicate trade, invite trouble. They told him he could not afford another war for a woman's marriage."

She lifted her cup. "As if wars are ever fought for honest reasons."

I drank without knowing how to respond.

Margaret leaned forward slightly.

"My father relented," she said. "Not because he loved me enough to want me happy. Because he feared the king. Because he understood that the king's anger could reach even a European factory."

She paused. Then her voice softened, a rare thing.

"And then I married this stubborn man," she said, nodding toward De Lannoy. "And we were happy. Happier than any of them expected. Happier than my father deserved."

From the back room, De Lannoy called, "Do not make me sound like a saint."

Margaret replied, "I would never insult you that way."

The exchange was intimate in a way that made my chest tighten. Not romance. Not softness. A shared language of survival.

Margaret looked at me again.

"You have children," she said.

"Yes."

"Do they belong?" she asked, blunt.

I thought of Willem's question.

"I do not know," I admitted.

Margaret nodded, satisfied. "Good. That is the beginning of truth. Everyone else will pretend they know, and their pretending will make your children bleed."

She stood and walked to the altar, adjusting the candle with a practised hand.

"Tell your son this," she said without turning. "Belonging is not a gift. It is not a priest's blessing. It is not a name. It is the work you do every day until the land has no choice but to admit you are part of it."

Her words sounded like De Lannoy's, and I realised that Margaret had learned the same arithmetic in a different arena.

De Lannoy returned to the room then, a cloth-wrapped object in his hands.

He set it on the table and unwrapped it.

A small wooden horse, carved roughly, the kind a child might play with.

"For Willem," he said.

Margaret's eyes flicked toward him, amused. "For Willem," she echoed. "Not because you care about children."

De Lannoy glared. "Because the boy will be a soldier one day. Soldiers should have something made of wood before they have something made of iron."

He pushed the horse toward me.

"Take it," he said. "And tell your son that I was foreign too, once, in the way that matters. I lost it. I did not die. He will not die either."

I picked up the horse. The wood was smooth where hands had worn it.

"Thank you," I said.

De Lannoy waved the words away as if gratitude was wasteful.

On the way out, Margaret touched my sleeve lightly.

"Your wife," she said. "Lakshmi. She is strong."

"Yes," I replied.

Margaret's gaze sharpened. "Then listen to her when she tells you the truth. Do not make your children carry your uncertainty like a sack of stones."

I nodded, feeling both chastised and helped.

Outside, the fort's drums began again.

I walked back to my house by the backwaters with a wooden horse under my arm and the taste of toddy and pepper in my mouth, and I understood something I had not understood before.

My life here was not temporary. It was not an exile waiting to end.

It was a construction, like a wall, built by stubborn hands in monsoon rain.

That night, I placed the wooden horse beside Willem's sleeping mat.

In the morning, he would find it and ask questions.

And I would try, again, to answer without lying.
