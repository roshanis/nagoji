# Blood and Thrones, Book 2: The Dutchman's Son

## Working Title: The Dutchman's Son

### Core Premise

Pieter van der Berg was sixteen years old when the Dutch army marched on Travancore and was destroyed at Colachel. Captured and trained by Eustachius De Lannoy, he becomes an artillery officer in the army he once fought against. Now in his thirties and forties, he serves under the aging De Lannoy during the reign of Dharma Raja, witnesses his mentor's death, and watches as a new threat rises from the north - Hyder Ali of Mysore, whose rockets and disciplined armies make the Dutch look like amateurs.

This is the story of a man caught between worlds - European by birth, Travancorean by choice - as the old order crumbles and a new, more dangerous era begins.

### Series Position

- **Book 1, Marthanda Varma (1730s-1753):** Horse of the Servant - Nagoji Sawant's transformation from prisoner to general, the defeat of the Dutch, the building of Travancore.
- **Book 2, Dharma Raja (1758-1782):** The Dutchman's Son - Pieter van der Berg's journey from captured soldier to artillery commander, the death of De Lannoy, the rise of Hyder Ali.
- **Book 3, Tipu Sultan (1782-1799):** Tiger's Heir - Bhalerao's story, Tipu's invasion, the siege of Seringapatam.

### Time Period

1758-1782, covering:
- The reign of Dharma Raja (Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma, r. 1758-1798)

- The First and Second Anglo-Mysore Wars
- With flashbacks to Colachel (1741) and the post-war years

### Narrator

**Pieter van der Berg**, telling his story in first person past tense.

His voice is:
- Thoughtful, observational - the outsider who sees what natives miss
- Tinged with melancholy - a man who can never fully belong anywhere
- Technically precise - an artilleryman who thinks in trajectories, angles, windage, and powder weights
- Reads battlefields in arcs of fire; describes people with the same clinical eye he uses for gun emplacements
- Increasingly weary as the old world dies around him
- Fluent in multiple languages, comfortable in multiple cultures, at home in none

## Major Characters

### The Narrator

**Pieter van der Berg**
- Born 1725 in Batavia (Dutch East Indies) to a Dutch father and Eurasian mother
- Raised Lutheran - taught to distrust Catholics, especially the French and Spanish
- Joined the VOC army at 14, sent to Ceylon, then to the Malabar coast
- Sixteen years old at the Battle of Colachel (1741) - captured, not killed
- Initially resented De Lannoy: a Frenchman, a Catholic, a traitor to Europe
- De Lannoy recognised his aptitude for mathematics and gunnery despite the boy's hostility
- Slow thaw over years - respect for competence before affection for the man
- Remains Lutheran, but marries Lakshmi, a local Nair woman, without conversion
- Their household becomes a quiet scandal: a Christian gunner in a Hindu king's service, with a Hindu wife and children who belong fully to neither world
- Now in his thirties to fifties during the main action (1758-1782)
- Senior artillery officer at Udayagiri, De Lannoy's trusted subordinate
- Father of three children - caught between Dutch heritage and Travancorean identity
- Witnesses De Lannoy's death and must carry on his legacy
- The last link between the Dutch era and what comes after

### The Mentor

**Eustachius De Lannoy**
- Flemish, French-speaking, Catholic - foreign even among the Dutch he commanded
- In his twenties at Colachel, in his forties at Marthanda Varma's death, in his sixties by 1777
- Pieter's mentor, father figure, and model for transformation
- The young Lutheran Pieter saw him as doubly treacherous: papist and Frenchman
- Won Pieter's respect through competence, patience, and refusing to take offence
- Still sharp but aging, aware his time is ending
- Passes his knowledge to Pieter and to his own sons
- Remains Catholic to the end - neither Dutch nor Travancorean priests ever fully claim him
- Dies in 1777, leaving a void that cannot be filled
- His death marks the true end of an era

### De Lannoy's Family

**Margaret De Lannoy** (De Lannoy's wife)
- Daughter of the English Company factor at Anchuthengu (Anjengo)
- Her father refused the match at first: De Lannoy was a defector, a Frenchman in the factor's eyes, and disgraced in European eyes
- When Marthanda Varma heard, he was ready to march on the factory, but his ministers talked him down
- In the end, the father relented and gave his daughter
- The union was happy, affectionate, and steady
- Mother of his children, keeper of his household
- Represents the domestic side of transformation

**Hendrik De Lannoy** (elder son)
- In his 30s-40s during the main action
- Artillery officer like his father, disciplined and capable
- Will inherit command of Udayagiri's guns
- Pieter's colleague and sometimes rival

**Caspar De Lannoy** (younger son)
- In his 20s-30s during the main action
- Brave to the point of recklessness, brilliant under pressure
- Drinks and gambles off duty, not from cowardice but from restlessness and grief
- Cannot find his place in peace; feels most alive under fire
- Pieter tries to steady him as De Lannoy steadied Pieter
- A warning that courage is not the same as belonging

### Pieter's Family

**Lakshmi** (Pieter's wife)
- Local woman from a Nair family
- Married Pieter despite family objections
- Strong, practical, the anchor of his life in Travancore
- Gives him three children and a reason to stay

**The Children**
- Mixed heritage - Dutch father, Nair mother
- Caught between worlds like their father
- Represent the future - what will become of those who are neither one thing nor another?

### The Rulers

**Marthanda Varma** (dies 1758)
- Appears briefly at the start, passing the torch
- The giant whose shadow stretches over everything

**Dharma Raja** (Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma)
- Nephew of Marthanda Varma, reigns from 1758
- Scholarly, pious, patron of arts - not a warrior king
- Must navigate threats his uncle never faced
- Relies on De Lannoy, then on those De Lannoy trained
- His relationship with Pieter is more distant than Marthanda Varma's was with De Lannoy

**Raja Kesavadas** (Dalawa)
- The brilliant chief minister
- Political genius who keeps Travancore balanced between Mysore and Britain
- Works closely with the military commanders

### The Old Guard (from Book 1)

**Ananthan Pillai** (formerly Nagoji Sawant)
- Now elderly, semi-retired cavalry commander
- Pieter knows him as a legend, interacts occasionally
- Represents the first generation of outsiders-become-Travancorean
- His story connects to Pieter's - both transformed by Travancore

**Revathi Bayi**
- Elder stateswoman, still sharp and political
- Pieter deals with her on military matters
- She remembers the old days, provides continuity

### The New Threats

**Hyder Ali**
- Sultan of Mysore, military genius
- Rises from soldier to ruler through cunning and force
- His army - rockets, European-trained infantry, disciplined cavalry - is unlike anything India has seen
- Not a character Pieter meets, but a presence that grows throughout the book
- The shadow on the northern horizon

**The British**
- East India Company officers appear as allies, rivals, threats
- Pieter, as a European, has complex relationships with them
- They represent a new kind of colonialism - not trade but conquest
- Some are decent; others are the future oppressors

- De Lannoy teaches him to read a battlefield in arcs and angles
- The discipline of powder - measuring charges, timing fuses, respecting what kills
- The first time he sights a gun properly, he feels the world narrow to a line
- De Lannoy's lesson: "Artillery decides battles. Infantry holds ground. Cavalry exploits. Remember the order."

**Chapter 5: Lakshmi**
- Pieter marries Lakshmi, a Nair woman, without conversion
- Her family objects; priests object; the fort gossips

- Willem asks: "Am I Dutch?" Pieter has no good answer
- The children speak Malayalam as mother tongue, will never see Europe
- The chapel at Udayagiri remains De Lannoy's private island of faith
- Pieter, Lutheran by upbringing and name, living in a Hindu world, finds he belongs to neither
- De Lannoy's household nearby: his wife, the factor's daughter, and the quiet power of a marriage the king once nearly went to war for

**Chapter 8: The Sons of De Lannoy**
- Hendrik and Caspar introduced through a gun drill - loading, aiming, firing in sequence
- Hendrik times his crew like a clock; Caspar improvises and still hits the mark

#### Chapters 9-16

**Chapter 9: News from Mysore**
- Reports of a soldier who has seized power in Mysore
- De Lannoy's assessment is simple: "This one is different."

**Chapter 10: The Rocket Wound**
- Refugees bring stories, and bodies burned in a way cannon does not burn
- Pieter studies the damage like scripture, fascinated and horrified
- The wounds are different - shrapnel patterns, blast burns, the randomness of it
- He sketches the injuries, calculates the probable range, estimates the payload
- A gunner's mind cannot help but admire what a gunner's heart fears

**Chapter 11: English Faces**

- Every gunner knows the math: a magazine explosion kills everyone within fifty yards
- Men freeze, calculating whether to run or save what can be saved
- Caspar runs into the smoke without thinking, beats out flames with his bare hands
- He drags burning barrels clear, organizes a bucket chain, saves men and powder both
- Pieter watches and sees what De Lannoy must have seen in him once: the instinct that precedes thought
- Afterwards Caspar drinks harder, as if courage needs a payment
- His hands shake for days; he hides them when his father visits

**Chapter 14: Pepper and Lead**
- Pieter sees how war is funded and delayed, paid for in pepper and promises
- The Company offers protection and takes measurements, both at once

**Chapter 15: Prisoners of Mysore**
- Pieter questions Mysorean captives and hears discipline where he expected bravado
- They describe infantry drilled in the French style - ranks, volleys, bayonet charges
- Cavalry trained to wheel and strike, not to charge headlong and die gloriously

**Chapter 16: The First Mysore War**
- 1767-1769 - Hyder Ali fights the British and their allies
- Reports of British infantry squares holding against cavalry, then breaking under rockets
- Squares can stop cavalry charges, but they cannot stop iron tubes that scream from the sky
- Travancore touches the edge of the war and feels how sharp it is
- Pieter drills his gunners harder, imagining targets that move faster than any he has faced

### Part Three: The Dying of the Light (1770-1777)

De Lannoy's final years. The defensive lines take shape. Pieter senses that the man who remade him is running out of time.

#### Chapters 17-24

**Chapter 17: The Old Man's Burden**
- De Lannoy in his sixties, still sharp, the body failing where the mind will not
- He speaks more openly now, as if his silences are no longer useful

**Chapter 18: The Chapel**
- De Lannoy never converted; he remains Catholic in a Hindu king's service
- Pieter asks whether belonging is a place, a faith, or simply work done well

**Chapter 19: The Dutch Shadow**
- Letters and rumours of a Dutch world shrinking, losing its grip
- Pieter realises the Company does not intend to become like the Dutch

**Chapter 20: The Wall Takes Shape**
- The Nedumkotta is surveyed and extended, a line cut across the land
- Pieter maps artillery arcs - interlocking fields of fire, dead zones, enfilade positions
- He learns to think like an engineer: walls are not just barriers but platforms for guns
- Every bastion placed to cover its neighbour; every gun sited to sweep the approaches
- De Lannoy approves the plans with a nod: "You have learned to see what is not yet there."

**Chapter 21: Night on the Lines**
- Monsoon work under lantern light, mud sucking at feet, men cursing and praying
- A small raid tests the unfinished works - Mysorean scouts probing for weakness
- Pieter commands a battery in wet darkness, firing by instinct when visibility fails
- Grapeshot at close range, the terrible sound of iron meeting flesh
- The raiders withdraw; Pieter counts the bodies and calculates his accuracy

**Chapter 22: Hendrik's Command**
- Hendrik steps forward as heir, disciplined and cold
- Pieter must accept being the bridge, not the crown

**Chapter 23: Lakshmi's Wisdom**
- Lakshmi refuses Pieter's self-pity with practical tenderness
- "You think too much about where you came from. Think about where you are."

**Chapter 24: The Last Order**
- 1777 - De Lannoy dies, leaving instructions as plain as gun drill
- Pieter takes the weight of the fort on his shoulders and feels older at once

### Part Four: The Heir of Nothing (1777-1782)

After De Lannoy. The Second Anglo-Mysore War burns hotter. Pieter and the De Lannoy sons must hold together what their father built, while the Company tightens its grip.

#### Chapters 25-32

**Chapter 25: The Funeral**
- Catholic prayers and local rites in the same soil
- Pieter realises the funeral is also a handover of power

**Chapter 26: The Heir of Udayagiri**
- Hendrik takes formal command, Pieter becomes the indispensable shadow
- Caspar grows more restless, searching for a war that is not yet here

**Chapter 27: Caspar's Choice**
- A duel, a scandal, a near-disaster forces discipline to show its teeth
- Caspar refuses to beg for mercy or hide behind his father's name
- He volunteers for the most dangerous posting on the northern works

**Chapter 28: Pollilur's Echo**
- 1780 - news of Pollilur reaches Travancore like a sickness
- European drill broken by Indian rockets - the impossible made real
- Pieter interviews survivors with shaking hands, reads reports that read like nightmares
- The story: Colonel Baillie's force formed squares, textbook perfect, bayonets bristling
- The squares held against cavalry charges - they always held, that was the point
- Then the rockets came, iron tubes trailing fire, exploding among the packed ranks
- Men who survived cavalry broke under the screaming, the randomness, the fire from above
- Squares became graves; discipline became a way to die in neat rows
- The rockets weren't just weapons - they were proof that Indian innovation could defeat European discipline
- Everything Pieter believed about military superiority dies in a single afternoon's telling
- He rewrites the Udayagiri defenses that night: dispersal, cover, counter-battery positions
- A square is a target. He will not give Mysore targets.

**Chapter 29: The Lines Tested**
- Mysorean raiders probe the borders in force - cavalry, infantry, rocket teams
- Pieter's new doctrine tested: gunners dispersed, firing from covered positions
- No squares - infantry in loose formation behind the wall, taking cover, shooting from loopholes
- The rockets fall where squares would have been; the empty ground absorbs them
- Counter-battery fire seeks the rocket crews; Pieter has trained his gunners to aim for the flash
- The wall holds because men hold it, bleeding in the mud, but fewer than at Pollilur

**Chapter 30: Refugees Again**
- Waves of people flee south, carrying stories that sound like prophecy
- Pieter sees how fear moves faster than any army

**Chapter 31: The Company's Price**
- The British offer help and demand access, advisers, supplies
- Pieter watches the ledger grow heavier than the gun

**Chapter 32: The Tiger Dies**
- 1782 - Hyder Ali dies
- Relief lasts a single breath; Tipu inherits the war
- Pieter stands on the wall and looks north, knowing the worst may still be ahead

---

## Epilogue: The Torch Passes

Pieter, now in his late fifties, writes his account. He knows he will not live to see the end of the story. But he has done what he can - maintained the walls, trained the gunners, kept faith with De Lannoy's memory.

Years ago, a report crossed his desk: the old cavalry commander Ananthan Pillai - the legendary Nagoji Sawant, whom Pieter never knew well but always respected - had taken in a Maratha fugitive. A man with a brand on his forehead that marked him as a temple-robber and murderer. Ananthan's wife Revathi insisted, the report said. The branded man worked in their stables, at first.

Pieter remembers it now because he hears the same name again in a dispatch from the northern marches. Bhalerao. The branded one. Not a stable hand any longer.

Pieter wonders what Travancore will make of him in the years ahead. Another outsider. Another man with blood on his hands seeking something he cannot name.

Travancore takes what it needs. It took De Lannoy. It took Nagoji. It took Pieter.

Perhaps it will take Bhalerao too.

The wheel turns. The story goes on.

## Historical Notes

### Key Events to Incorporate

1. **Death of Marthanda Varma (1758)** - Transition to Dharma Raja
2. **Rise of Hyder Ali (1760s)** - From soldier to Sultan of Mysore
3. **First Anglo-Mysore War (1767-1769)** - Hyder vs. British coalition
4. **Construction and extension of Nedumkotta** - The Travancore Lines, a 48km defensive wall
5. **Death of De Lannoy (1777)** - End of an era
6. **Second Anglo-Mysore War (1780-1784)** - Hyder's greatest victories
7. **Battle of Pollilur (1780)** - Mysorean rockets devastate British forces
8. **Death of Hyder Ali (1782)** - Tipu Sultan succeeds him

### The Dutch in Travancore

After Colachel (1741), several Dutch soldiers chose to stay in Travancore:
- Some converted; some remained Christian and married locally
- They formed a small community of "country-born" Europeans
- Their children were mixed heritage, often serving in the military
- By the 1770s-80s, they were dying out or assimilating completely
- Pieter represents this transitional generation

Note: Surviving records of De Lannoy's family and successors in Travancore service are sparse. Hendrik and Caspar are fictional names, chosen as plausible, representing the continuation of his household and military legacy.

### De Lannoy's Origins

Eustachius De Lannoy was Flemish (from the Southern Netherlands, modern Belgium):
- French-speaking, Catholic - distinct from the Dutch Calvinist/Lutheran majority
- The VOC employed soldiers from across Europe; religious and national tensions simmered
- Dutch Protestants viewed Catholics with suspicion, especially after the religious wars
- Pieter's Lutheran hostility toward De Lannoy reflects real divisions within the Company's forces
- De Lannoy's foreignness among the Dutch may have made his later transformation easier

### Mysorean Rockets

Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan pioneered military rockets:
- Iron-cased rockets with greater range and stability than European equivalents
- Used en masse to break enemy formations
- Terrifying psychological weapon
- Later influenced British rocket development (Congreve rockets)

### Infantry Squares and European Tactics

The infantry square was the dominant European defensive formation:
- Hollow rectangle with bayonets facing outward on all sides
- Designed to stop cavalry charges - horses will not charge into a bristling wall of steel
- Required strict discipline: if men broke formation, the square collapsed
- Effective against cavalry but vulnerable to artillery and, crucially, to rockets
- At Pollilur (1780), Baillie's squares held against cavalry, then shattered under rocket bombardment
- The square's weakness: concentrated men make concentrated targets

### Artillery in 18th Century India

Artillery was the decisive arm of warfare:
- Types: field guns (mobile), siege guns (heavy), mortars (high-angle fire)
- Grapeshot for close defence - essentially giant shotgun blasts
- Canister for even closer work - tin cans full of musket balls
- The gunner's art: calculating range, elevation, windage, powder charge
- Rate of fire mattered as much as accuracy - a well-drilled crew could fire 2-3 rounds per minute
- De Lannoy's innovation: training local gunners to European standards

---

## Thematic Elements

### Continuity with Book 1

1. **Transformation** - Pieter's journey mirrors Nagoji's
2. **Travancore as crucible** - The kingdom that remakes outsiders
3. **Mentor relationships** - De Lannoy to Pieter as Ramayyan was to Nagoji
4. **The cost of belonging** - What is lost when you become something new
5. **European powers** - Dutch giving way to British

### Setup for Book 3

1. **Hyder Ali's legacy** - The threat that Tipu will inherit
2. **The Nedumkotta** - The walls Pieter helps build will be tested
3. **Bhalerao's arrival** - Can be foreshadowed or shown at the end
4. **The next generation** - What happens to those who are neither one thing nor another

### Unique Themes for Book 2

1. **The dying of the light** - Watching an era end, a mentor die
2. **Courage without belonging** - Caspar as counterpoint to Pieter's harder-earned integration
3. **Technology and war** - The rockets, infantry squares, the mathematics of killing
   - European drill (squares, volleys, bayonets) meets Indian innovation (rockets, mobility, terror)
   - Pieter's technical mind grapples with weapons that break all his assumptions
   - The Nedumkotta as defensive answer: walls, artillery arcs, dispersal instead of concentration
4. **The European perspective** - Seeing India through eyes that are both inside and outside

## Voice Notes

### Pieter's Distinctive Voice

Unlike Nagoji (passionate, physical, transforming) or Bhalerao (dark, self-loathing, desperate), Pieter is:

- **Observational** - He watches and records, the outsider's eye
- **Technical** - Artillery training shapes his thinking
- **Melancholic** - He knows he doesn't fully belong anywhere
- **Philosophical** - More inclined to reflection than action
- **Multilingual** - Thinks in Dutch, speaks Malayalam, no longer prays at all
- **Spiritually adrift** - Raised Lutheran, remains Lutheran in name, envies De Lannoy's Catholic certainty

### Sample Voice

*"I have lived in Travancore for forty years, and I am still not certain what I am. The Dutch would call me a deserter, a traitor, a man who forgot his blood. The Travancoreans call me Pieter, and when they are angry they call me *Parangi*, as if a word could make me a foreigner again. My children have skin the colour of tea with milk, and they speak Malayalam as their mother tongue, and they will never see Amsterdam or Batavia or any of the places my fathers came from. What does that make them? What does that make me?*

*De Lannoy said it did not matter. He said we become what we do, not what we were born. I hated him when he said it - hated his French accent, his papist certainties, his calm acceptance of a world I was still fighting. Now I watch his coffin lowered into Travancorean soil, and I envy him. He knew what he believed. He never stopped being Catholic, never stopped being himself. He simply added Travancore to what he already was.*

*I subtracted. Lutheran boy to Hindu man, and somewhere in between I lost the part of me that knew how to pray.*

*Perhaps De Lannoy was right. Perhaps becoming is enough. Or perhaps we are all just pretending, wearing masks that grow so familiar we forget they are masks at all."*

## Chapter Count

32 chapters across 4 parts, covering approximately 25 years (1758-1782), plus an epilogue and flashbacks reaching back to 1741.

This gives roughly:
- 8 chapters per part
- 2,500-4,000 words per chapter
- Total: 80,000-120,000 words for Book 2

---

## Development Notes (Drafting Recommendations)

1. **Timeline clarity**: Book 2 ends at **1782 (Hyder's death)**. Chapter 32 and epilogue acknowledge the war continues - Tipu inherits the throne and the conflict. Clean hinge point; Book 3 picks up the thread.
2. **Lutheran-Catholic tension**: Pieter's Lutheran upbringing gives his early chapters texture. He distrusts De Lannoy not just as a captor but as a papist Frenchman - doubly foreign. The slow thaw from resentment to respect to love is one of the book's emotional cores.
3. **De Lannoy's faith**: Keep De Lannoy Catholic to the end; his chapel life and funeral rites become a recurring reminder that Travancore uses outsiders but never fully absorbs them. Pieter, who abandoned Lutheranism for Hinduism, envies De Lannoy's certainty.
4. **Caspar's arc**: Keep him brave on-page. Let his drinking and gambling read as aftermath and restlessness, not cowardice, and give him at least two clear moments where his courage saves lives (the Udayagiri powder accident in Ch 13, then his choice to take the most dangerous posting in Ch 27).
5. **Anchor set pieces**: Military technicality should drive suspense:
   - Ch 10: Pieter examining rocket wounds, sketching injuries, calculating payload
   - Ch 13: Caspar's Fire - the mathematics of magazine explosions, the instinct that saves
   - Ch 21: Night battle on Nedumkotta - grapeshot in darkness, firing by instinct
   - Ch 28: Pollilur - the failure of infantry squares, Pieter rewriting doctrine overnight
   - Ch 29: New tactics tested - dispersal vs. concentration, counter-battery fire
6. **Book 3 handoff**: Bhalerao appears via report in the epilogue - Pieter learns that Ananthan Pillai has taken in a branded Maratha fugitive. Readers of Book 1 recognise Ananthan; new readers won't be confused. Travancore is the constant, not any single character.
