# Chapter 9: News from Mysore

News has a smell.

In Batavia it smelled of salt and clove, carried on the backs of sailors who had not washed in weeks. In Ceylon it smelled of cinnamon and wet rope. In Travancore it came on the pepper boats, wrapped in the sharp sweetness of spice and the sour stink of fish, and it came on the tongues of men who had walked too far and slept too little.

The first time I heard Hyder Ali's name spoken in Udayagiri, it did not sound like a king's name. It sounded like a soldier's name, short and hard, the kind of name you shout over cannon fire when you want a man to move.

De Lannoy did not look up from his slate when the messenger said it.

I did.

---

It was a day of drills, the kind that left men hungry and irritable and convinced they had been made to suffer for no reason.

Hendrik ran the battery like a clock. Sponge. Load. Ram. Prick. Prime. Aim. Fire. Each command snapped out, each movement answered by hands that had learned to obey without thinking. The gun crews sweated through their cloth and kept their eyes on Hendrik's fingers, waiting for the next signal.

Caspar stood behind the second gun with his arms folded, watching as if he were bored. Boredom was his disguise. When he was bored he was dangerous, because he was looking for something that could make him feel alive.

I moved along the line, checking vents, checking wedges, listening for the small sounds that meant a carriage bolt had loosened. A gun tells you what it needs if you have the patience to hear it.

The messenger arrived in the middle of a firing sequence, which was either brave or foolish. He pushed through the gun yard with his head bowed against the smoke, coughing as if the powder had insulted him.

He was not one of our men. His cloth was travel-stained, his feet cracked. A strip of white bandage wrapped his forehead, and dried blood had turned the cloth brown at the edge.

He had come fast.

Hendrik saw him first. His hand went up and the yard froze. The gun crews held their positions, sponges still in barrels, rammers still against shot, as if time itself had been ordered to stop.

The messenger walked straight to De Lannoy.

De Lannoy stepped out from the shade of the shed, crop in one hand, slate in the other. He looked the man up and down, assessing injuries the way he assessed guns.

"Who sent you?" he asked in Malayalam.

"The *Dalawa*," the messenger replied, voice hoarse. "From Padmanabhapuram. Raja Kesavadas."

At that name, De Lannoy's attention sharpened.

He glanced at me. "Pieter. Come."

I followed him into the shed. Hendrik came too, expression tight. Caspar drifted after us like smoke, pretending he had only followed out of curiosity.

The gun yard resumed behind us, the next volley cracking, then rolling into echoes against the fort walls.

---

The shed smelled of chalk and old powder, of leather straps and oiled wood. It was where De Lannoy kept his maps and his tables, his measurements and his quiet plans. It was the closest thing he had to a private world.

The messenger sank onto a low stool without being invited. Travel had hollowed him out. His hands shook as he reached for the water De Lannoy pushed toward him.

He drank and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

"Speak," De Lannoy said.

The messenger drew a breath that sounded like it hurt.

"Mysore is changing," he said. "They say the Raja is still there, still on the throne, but the throne is only a chair now. The man who sits beside it gives the orders."

De Lannoy's eyes narrowed. "Name."

"Hyder Ali," the messenger said.

Caspar made a small sound of impatience. "We have heard names from Mysore before," he said in Malayalam, casual but dismissive. "Kings, ministers, generals. They fight each other. They drink. They die."

The messenger looked at him, then back at De Lannoy. "This one does not drink," he said. "Or if he does, he does it in private."

Hendrik's mouth twitched, as if he was about to laugh and decided it was not safe.

The messenger continued.

"He was a soldier," he said. "They say he rose from nothing. A man of the saddle, not the court. He fought for the Raja and won, and now the Raja cannot say no to him."

De Lannoy pulled a map toward him, the parchment worn at the folds. It was not a Dutch map. Dutch maps were proud things, full of lines and names and the illusion that drawing a coast meant owning it. This map had been copied by local scribes and corrected by De Lannoy's own hand, practical and ugly, a map meant to keep men alive.

He placed a finger on the rough shape of Mysore.

"What has he done?" De Lannoy asked.

The messenger swallowed. "He drills his men," he said. "Every day. He pays them on time. He punishes thieves. He builds magazines and keeps them dry. He has taken forts that held out against others for years."

That last detail mattered more than the name. Forts do not surrender to speeches. They surrender to hunger, or fear, or gunpowder applied with patience.

De Lannoy's finger moved down the map, tracing the routes south.

"How far?" he asked.

"Not to us yet," the messenger said. "But he has moved west and north. He has swallowed little kingdoms the way fire swallows dry grass. The smoke is rising. The other powers are watching and pretending they do not smell it."

De Lannoy leaned back slightly.

Hendrik spoke, cautious. "And the Company?"

The messenger shrugged. "The Company smiles," he said. "They have always smiled. They send letters. They make alliances with men who will betray them and then act surprised when it happens."

Caspar snorted.

De Lannoy did not.

"You saw this yourself?" he asked the messenger.

The messenger nodded, then hesitated, as if deciding whether to speak the next part.

De Lannoy waited. He was good at waiting. He had built a kingdom's army out of patience.

"I was with a caravan north of Palakkad," the messenger said finally. "Pepper and cardamom going up, iron coming down. We were not soldiers. We were men with knives and prayers, and we believed the road would let us pass if we kept our heads down."

His fingers tightened around the cup.

"We were wrong," he said. "Hyder's men took the road as if it belonged to them. They stopped every caravan, searched every bale. They were not bandits. Bandits take what they can carry. These men took what they wanted and wrote down what they left behind."

He looked at De Lannoy, eyes fever-bright.

"They were organised," he said. "They had officers who could count."

De Lannoy's gaze flicked to me for a moment, as if he could not help comparing.

The messenger went on.

"A poligar's men tried to stop them at a narrow stretch of road," he said. "He had a wall and a ditch and a hundred men with matchlocks who had never been paid properly. He thought the road would make him strong."

His voice roughened as he remembered.

"Hyder's infantry came in ranks," he said. "Not charging, not shouting, just walking forward as if they had all agreed to die on the same step. The poligar's men fired. Smoke covered them. Men fell. The next rank stepped over the bodies and kept walking."

I pictured it without wanting to. A line of muskets. The rhythm of feet. The way disciplined men move through fear by turning it into habit.

"The poligar's cavalry charged," the messenger said. "They thought horses could solve what walls could not."

Caspar's eyes sharpened. He liked cavalry. He liked the simplicity of speed and steel.

"Hyder's men did not break," the messenger said. "They opened. They let the horses come into the gap. Then they closed again behind them, and the cavalry found itself in a pocket of smoke and bayonets."

Hendrik inhaled softly. Bayonets. A European word, a European method. Local armies had always had spears. Bayonets were spears welded to guns, a promise that a man could kill at distance and then kill again up close.

"And then," the messenger said, and his hands began to shake again, "the rockets came."

The word landed in the shed with a small thud, as if someone had dropped an iron weight.

"Describe them," De Lannoy said.

The messenger swallowed twice. "Iron tubes," he said. "As long as a man's forearm. Lashed to bamboo. Men carried them like bundles of firewood until an officer shouted, then they knelt and touched flame to the fuse."

His eyes darted as if he could still see it.

"They screamed," he said. "Not like a gun. Like an animal. They flew low, bouncing when they hit the ground, skidding and spinning. One went into the ditch and burst there, and the ditch became a pot of boiling blood. Another hit a horse in the belly and the horse opened, like a sack cut with a knife."

Caspar's jaw tightened. Hendrik's face stayed still, but his knuckles went white where his hand rested on the map.

I felt my stomach turn, not from squeamishness but from recognition.

The messenger was describing a weapon that did not behave like cannon or musket. Cannon balls are predictable. Muskets are inaccurate but simple. Rockets, if they were truly being used like this, were something else. Chaos harnessed. A weapon that made fear part of its mechanism.

"The poligar's men ran," the messenger said. "Not because they were cowards. Because the sound made their legs move. Men ran and looked back and ran again. The cavalry tried to wheel away, but the horses could not see through the smoke. They trampled their own men in the ditch."

His voice dropped.

"The road was full of blood and broken carts," he said. "Hyder's men walked through it and did not hurry."

Silence filled the shed.

Outside, the gun yard's thunder sounded suddenly childish, like boys playing at war.

De Lannoy looked down at the map as if it had become a different object.

When he spoke, his voice was quiet.

"This one is different," he said.

He did not say it with fear. He said it with the calm of a man recognising a new kind of weather.

He looked at Hendrik, then at Caspar, then at me.

"We have fought kings," he said. "We have fought merchants. We have fought the vanity of Europe."

His crop tapped the map once, near Mysore.

"Now we may have to fight a soldier," he said. "A man who will learn from every mistake we make."

That evening, when I returned to my house by the backwaters, Lakshmi was cutting fish on a flat stone in the yard. The smell of salt and blood rose in the humid air. Our children played with a wooden wheel near the steps, arguing in a mixture of Malayalam and the Dutch I had taught them in moments of foolish sentiment.

Lakshmi looked up when she saw my face.

"Bad news," she said.

She had already read it on my face.

I sat on the step and watched the backwater shift under the last light, the surface broken by small ripples from unseen fish.

"Mysore," I said.

Lakshmi's knife kept moving, steady. "Mysore is far," she said.

For a moment I wanted to believe her. Distance is comforting. It lets men pretend war belongs to other people's lives.

I pictured the messenger's rockets, the way he had described them skidding and screaming, the way a ditch could become a pot of boiling blood.

"Far is not the same as safe," I said.

Lakshmi set the fish aside and rinsed her hands. She sat beside me, close enough that our shoulders touched.

"De Lannoy is worried," she said.

I nodded.

Lakshmi watched the children, her expression unreadable. "Then it is true," she said quietly. "When the old lion worries, the jungle is changing."

She did not ask for details. She did not ask me to promise anything. She knew promises are for men who control the future.

She simply put her hand on mine, warm and solid, and kept it there until the light faded.

In the dark, across the water, a night bird called once, sharp and lonely.

I lay awake long after Lakshmi and the children slept.

I tried to turn the messenger's account into numbers. How many men. How many rockets. How much powder. How far they could travel in a day.

Numbers usually steadied me.

That night they did not.
