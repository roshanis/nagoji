# Chapter 27: Caspar's Choice

Grief does not make men noble.

It reveals what they already are.

After De Lannoy was buried, Hendrik became colder. He poured his grief into orders and drill, as if the fort could be held together by discipline alone.

Caspar became louder.

He drank more openly, laughed more sharply, picked fights with anyone who looked at him too long.

He was trying to feel alive in a world that had taken his father and replaced him with paper.

The scandal began in a drinking shed.

Most scandals do.

---

The shed by the outer wall had always been a place where gunners went to forget the weight of iron.

It was not officially permitted.

It was tolerated.

A fort is like a gun. If you keep it too tight, it bursts.

That night the rain had stopped, and the air smelled of wet earth and cheap arrack.

Caspar sat on an upturned crate with a cup in hand, his shoulders loose, his eyes too bright. Two gunners sat with him, laughing at something that was not funny enough to deserve the laughter they gave it.

I should not have been there.

I went because Lakshmi's words about bridges were still in my head, and I knew that if Caspar broke, it would crack the whole family.

I sat at the edge of the shed and watched him drink.

Caspar noticed me and grinned.

"Come to drag me back to virtue?" he asked in Dutch.

"Come to make sure you do not set yourself on fire," I replied.

Caspar laughed, and the laugh was too sharp.

"Fire is honest," he said. "People are not."

Then the Company lieutenant walked in.

He wore no red coat. He wore plain cloth, but his posture was uniform. He had the same narrow face I remembered from years before, the mouth that looked permanently dissatisfied.

He had been with Hawkins once. Now he had returned with a new assignment and the same hungry eyes.

He scanned the shed and saw Caspar.

His gaze lingered.

Then he smiled.

"Well," he said in English, loud enough for everyone to hear, "the Frenchman's whelp drinks like an Englishman."

The gunners did not understand the words, but they understood the tone.

Caspar's grin did not change. Only his eyes did.

"I am not French," Caspar replied in English, his accent rough but clear. "And I am not your dog."

The lieutenant laughed.

"No," he said. "You are something else. Half made."

The words landed in the shed like a match dropped near powder.

I felt my stomach tighten.

Caspar set his cup down slowly.

"Say it again," he said.

The lieutenant shrugged, careless.

"Half made," he repeated. "Half European, half native. A man without a proper place. Your father defected. You inherited his shame."

Silence filled the shed.

Even the gunners felt it.

Caspar stood.

He moved with a smoothness that meant danger.

"My father built your Company's nightmares," he said quietly. "You should choose your words carefully."

The lieutenant smiled again, and the smile was the smile of a man who had never been hit hard enough to learn caution.

"Your father built the king's walls," he said. "Now he is in the ground. The Company is still here."

He leaned in slightly.

"It is the Company's time now," he said. "Men like you will learn where you belong."

Caspar's hand moved to his belt.

I stood too fast, the crate scraping.

"Caspar," I said, warning.

He did not look at me.

He stepped closer to the lieutenant.

"Outside," Caspar said.

The lieutenant's eyes gleamed.

"Gladly," he replied.

Men moved out of the way, instinctively. Even drunk gunners understand when a blade is coming.

They stepped into the night.

---

The coconut grove outside the fort wall was dark, the ground slick with damp leaves. The moon was a pale smear behind clouds.

The lieutenant drew his small sword with a flourish meant for an audience.

Caspar drew his blade without flourish.

Not a small sword.

A heavier fighting blade, the kind De Lannoy had always insisted on carrying even when European officers called it crude.

Caspar held it loosely, as if it were part of his hand.

The lieutenant glanced at the weapon and laughed.

"Savage steel," he said.

Caspar did not answer.

He stepped forward and cut.

Fast.

The lieutenant barely parried. The clang of metal sounded loud in the wet air.

The lieutenant's smile vanished.

He backed a step, then lunged, trying to recover pride with aggression.

Caspar moved aside and struck the lieutenant's sword arm with the flat of his blade, hard enough to make the man yelp.

The lieutenant stumbled, eyes wide now.

Caspar could have ended it then.

He did not.

He did not want a corpse.

He wanted recognition.

The lieutenant raised his sword again, breathing hard.

Caspar shook his head slightly, almost sad.

"You talk too much," he said.

Then he stepped in and cut the lieutenant's cheek.

Not deep.

Enough to draw blood.

Enough to mark.

The lieutenant froze, hand rising to his face, fingers coming away red.

The sight of his own blood seemed to surprise him.

Caspar lowered his sword.

"Go back to Madras," he said quietly. "Tell them you met a half-made man."

The lieutenant's eyes burned with humiliation.

He lifted his sword again.

And then Hendrik's voice snapped through the grove.

"Stop."

Torches flared. Travancore soldiers poured into the grove, spears leveled. Hendrik walked at their head, face pale with fury.

He looked at the lieutenant's bleeding face, then at Caspar's sword.

Then he looked at me.

For a moment I saw betrayal in his eyes.

Not because I had planned it.

Because I had failed to prevent it.

Hendrik's voice stayed calm.

"Put down the blade," he ordered Caspar in Malayalam.

Caspar held the lieutenant's gaze for another heartbeat, then lowered his sword to the ground.

The lieutenant's chest heaved. He looked at Hendrik as if expecting apology.

Hendrik gave him none.

"You," Hendrik said to the lieutenant in Portuguese, cold and precise, "will return to your camp now."

The lieutenant opened his mouth.

Hendrik raised his hand, and the lieutenant stopped, startled by the authority in the motion.

"If you speak of this in Padmanabhapuram," Hendrik continued, "you will speak of your insult as well as your wound."

The lieutenant's eyes narrowed.

He understood the threat.

He swallowed, nodded stiffly, and walked away into the dark, one hand pressed to his cheek.

Hendrik turned to Caspar.

"Inside," he said.

Caspar did not move.

"No," Caspar replied in Dutch.

Hendrik's jaw tightened. "Do not make this worse," he hissed.

Caspar's eyes flashed.

"Worse?" he said. "He called our father a traitor in your fort. He called me half made. You want me to bow?"

Hendrik stepped close, voice low.

"I want you to understand that your pride is not more important than the fort," he said.

Caspar's laugh was bitter.

"Your fort," he corrected.

The words were a knife.

Hendrik's face went hard.

"Yes," he said. "My fort. My responsibility. And you have just threatened it."

He gestured to the soldiers.

"Tie him," he ordered.

The soldiers hesitated.

Caspar's eyes widened, not in fear, in fury.

"Do it," Hendrik snapped.

The rope came out.

Caspar did not fight it.

That was what surprised me.

He stood still as they tied his wrists, his face expressionless.

He was making a choice.

Not to beg.

Not to plead.

Not to hide behind his father's grave.

He would accept punishment.

He would not accept humiliation.

---

Hendrik held him in the fort guard room overnight.

In the morning, Hendrik summoned Kesavadas' messenger and wrote a report in careful Malayalam.

Company lieutenant insulted.
Duel prevented from becoming death.
Fort discipline compromised.

Hendrik wrote as if he were building a wall out of words.

Then he called Caspar out into the shed.

Caspar's face was bruised where the rope had rubbed. His eyes were clear, sober, and full of something like relief.

Hendrik stood behind the table, the appointment letter still folded in his coat as if he needed to feel it.

"You will apologise to the Company lieutenant," Hendrik said, voice flat.

Caspar stared at him.

"No," he replied.

Hendrik's jaw tightened.

"Then you will be confined," he said. "And you will be stripped of duty. You will not carry a blade in this fort again."

Caspar's mouth twitched, almost a smile.

"You think that will punish me?" he asked. "You think taking war away will make me smaller?"

Hendrik leaned forward slightly.

"It will make you harmless," he said.

Caspar's eyes flashed.

"Harmless is death," he said.

Silence filled the shed.

Then Caspar spoke again, slower.

"Give me the Lines," he said.

Hendrik stared at him.

Caspar continued.

"Put me on the northern works," he said. "The most exposed section. The place raiders test first."

He lifted his bound wrists slightly.

"If you want me punished, make me useful," he said. "Give me mud and rain and watch duty. Give me the part of the wall that bleeds."

Hendrik's gaze held on him, hard.

"You are offering this so you can find danger again," Hendrik said.

Caspar nodded.

"Yes," he admitted. "And so you can tell Kesavadas you did not spare me."

He met Hendrik's eyes.

"I will not beg," he said. "But I will work."

The sentence surprised me.

Work.

De Lannoy's language.

Hendrik looked at Caspar for a long time.

Then he glanced at me.

The glance held a question.

Can he be trusted?

I thought of Caspar running into smoke.
Caspar bleeding for a fort.
Caspar unable to live in peace.

"He will hold a post," I said quietly. "If the post gives him something real to hold."

Hendrik turned back to Caspar.

"You go north at sunset," he said.

Caspar exhaled, a small release.

"And if you disgrace us again," Hendrik added, voice cold, "I will not send you to mud. I will send you away."

Caspar nodded.

"I understand," he said.

Hendrik stepped around the table and cut the rope from Caspar's wrists himself.

It was a gesture that was not mercy.

It was command.

Caspar rubbed his wrists once, then straightened.

"No apology?" he asked, and there was humour in it now, lighter.

Hendrik's eyes narrowed.

"No apology," Caspar answered for him.

He turned to me.

"Bridge," he said, and the word sounded less like an insult now. "Come see me off."

That evening, as Caspar walked out of Udayagiri with a small detachment of spearmen and a pack mule carrying his gear, he looked more alive than he had since his father's burial.

He was going to the wall that bleeds.

Hendrik watched from the parapet, face unreadable.

I stood beside him and understood the shape of the choice Hendrik had made.

He had punished his brother without breaking him.

He had sent his fire north where it might burn the enemy instead of the fort.

And he had done it without leaning on his father's name.

That was command.

Not paper.

Not seals.

Decisions that cost.
