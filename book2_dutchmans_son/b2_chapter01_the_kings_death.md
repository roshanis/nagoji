# Chapter 1: The King's Death

The cannons spoke at dawn.

I counted them from the ramparts of Udayagiri - twenty-one guns, fired at measured intervals, their thunder rolling across the green hills toward the sea. The king was dead. Marthanda Varma, who had built this kingdom from blood and genius, who had broken the Dutch and humbled the old nobility, who had made Travancore into something that mattered - he was gone.

I had served him for seventeen years. I had never spoken to him directly, not once. He was the king, and I was a captured Dutch gunner who had been permitted to live. The distance between us was measured in more than rank. And yet, standing on those walls as the smoke drifted across the morning sky, I felt something like grief.

Perhaps it was not grief for him. Perhaps it was grief for the world he had made, which would now have to survive without him.

My name is Pieter van der Berg. I was born in Batavia in the year of our Lord 1725, the son of a Dutch trader and a woman whose blood was mixed in ways my father never discussed. I joined the Company's army at fourteen, was shipped to Ceylon at fifteen, and was marching with the Dutch expedition against Travancore at sixteen.

That was in 1741. The Battle of Colachel, they called it later, though at the time it felt less like a battle than a slaughter. I remember the Travancorean lines emerging from the morning mist, more of them than we had expected, better armed than we had believed. I remember the sound of our formation breaking, the screams of men I had trained with dying in the mud. I remember running, and then not running, and then waking in chains with a wound in my side that should have killed me.

I was sixteen years old. I expected to die.

Instead, I met Eustachius De Lannoy.

---

But that is an old story, and today is a day for new ones. The king is dead. Long live the king.

I found De Lannoy in the chapel, as I knew I would. He knelt before the small altar he had built decades ago, his white hair falling past his shoulders, his lips moving in prayers I could not hear. Catholic prayers, spoken in Latin, in a Hindu kingdom where he had lived longer than he had ever lived in Europe. The contradictions of his life were written in that small room - the cross above the altar, the oil lamp burning in the corner, the Malayalam inscriptions on the walls.

I waited until he crossed himself and rose. His joints creaked with the effort; he was seventy-two years old, and the years had not been gentle.

"You heard the guns," he said. It was not a question.

"All of Travancore heard the guns."

"Yes." He moved to the window, looking out at the fort he had built, the walls he had designed, the cannon emplacements I now commanded under his supervision. "I remember when he was young. Marthanda Varma. Before he was king, before he was legend. He was just a prince then, hunted by his own family, fighting for a throne that seemed impossible to claim."

"You helped him claim it."

"I helped him build an army. He claimed the throne himself." De Lannoy's voice was soft, distant. "He was not a kind man. He was not even a good man, by most measures. He killed his enemies without mercy. He broke the old families that had ruled these lands for centuries. He did things that would damn him in any church I know."

"And yet?"

"And yet he built something. Something that will outlast all of us." De Lannoy turned to face me. His eyes, pale blue faded almost to grey, held mine. "That is what matters in the end, Pieter. Not whether we were good or kind or merciful. Whether we built something that endures."

I thought about that. I was thirty-three years old, no longer young, not yet old. I had a wife and three children. I had a rank and a purpose. I had a life in this strange green land that was nothing like the life I had imagined when I was a boy in Batavia.

"What happens now?" I asked.

"Now? Now the nephew becomes king. Dharma Raja, they will call him. He is not his uncle - he is scholarly, pious, more interested in temples than in wars. But perhaps that is what Travancore needs. His uncle built the walls. Perhaps the nephew can fill them with something worth defending."

The coronation came a week later.

I watched from the edges of the crowd, one more soldier in a sea of soldiers, as Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma was crowned Dharma Raja of Travancore. The ceremonies were elaborate, ancient, conducted by priests who chanted in Sanskrit while elephants swayed and drums thundered and the nobility of the kingdom prostrated themselves before their new master.

He was younger than I expected - perhaps thirty, with a scholar's soft hands and a contemplative expression that seemed out of place amid all the martial splendor. When he spoke, his voice was quiet, almost gentle. He spoke of dharma, of righteousness, of the duty a king owes to his people. He did not speak of war or conquest or the enemies who ringed Travancore on every side.

"He is not a warrior," I said to De Lannoy, who stood beside me.

"No. He is something else." De Lannoy's expression was unreadable. "His uncle was a sword. Perhaps the nephew is meant to be a shield."

"Can a shield hold against what is coming?"

De Lannoy did not answer. But I saw his eyes drift northward, toward the mountains that separated Travancore from the kingdoms beyond. Somewhere beyond those mountains, a soldier named Hyder Ali was building an army unlike anything India had ever seen.

The old king was dead. The new king was crowned. And the world was changing in ways none of us fully understood.

---

That night, I returned to my quarters in the fort and found my wife waiting for me.

Lakshmi was Nair, from a family that had served Travancore for generations. We had been married for twelve years, against the wishes of her family and the raised eyebrows of the Dutch community that no longer existed. She had given me three children - two boys and a girl - and she had given me something more valuable than children: a reason to stay.

"You have been with De Lannoy," she said. It was not a question. She always knew.

"The king is dead. We were... remembering."

"Remembering." She handed me a cup of something warm - rice water flavoured with ginger, a southern remedy for troubled minds. "You Dutch remember too much. Always looking backward, never forward."

"I am not Dutch anymore."

"You are not Travancorean either." Her voice was gentle, not accusing. We had had this conversation many times, in many forms. "You are something in between. Like our children."

I looked toward the room where the children slept. Willem, the eldest, was eleven now - old enough to begin training, old enough to ask questions about his father's past that I did not know how to answer. Anna was eight, with her mother's dark eyes and her father's restless curiosity. Little Thomaswas five, too young to understand anything except that his father sometimes looked sad for reasons he could not explain.

"What will happen to them?" I asked. "When we are gone, when De Lannoy is gone, when there is no one left who remembers what we were?"

"They will become what they become. Just as you did. Just as everyone does." Lakshmi sat beside me, her warmth familiar and comforting. "You think too much, husband. The king is dead. Another king has taken his place. The sun will rise tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that. The world goes on."

"The world is changing."

"The world is always changing. That does not mean we must change with it."

But we do, I thought. We change whether we want to or not. Travancore had changed me from a Dutch soldier into whatever I was now - not Dutch, not Travancorean, something that had no name in any language I knew. My children would change into something else again, something even further from what I had been.

Was that loss? Or was it simply the way of things?

I did not know. I am not sure I know even now.

*The king was dead. I had served him for seventeen years without ever speaking to him, and now he was gone, and another man sat on his throne.*

*I did not know then what was coming. None of us did. We thought the wars were over, the kingdom secure, the future assured. We did not know about Hyder Ali's rockets or Tipu's dreams of conquest. We did not know that the walls we had built would be tested as they had never been tested before.*

*We knew only that an era had ended, and another was beginning. We knew only that we were caught between what we had been and what we might become.*

*Travancore takes what it needs, De Lannoy had told me once. It had taken him, a Dutch commander who became a Travancorean legend. It had taken me, a captured boy who became an artillery officer with a Nair wife and mixed-blood children.*

*What would it take next? What would it make of us?*

*I did not know. But standing on the walls of Udayagiri, watching the smoke from the funeral pyres drift across the sky, I sensed that the answer would not be gentle.*

*The old king was dead. The new age was beginning.*

*God help us all.*
