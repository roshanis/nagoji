# Chapter 11: English Faces

The first time an Englishman called me brother, I wanted to hit him.

Not because he had insulted me. He had done the opposite. He had smiled, and put his hand on my arm as if we had shared a childhood, as if we had prayed in the same church, as if I had not watched English ships take Dutch ports while our officers wrote polite protests and pretended paper could stop cannon.

He had meant it as comfort.

That was what made it dangerous.

---

They arrived at Udayagiri in a palanquin and on horseback, under a white cloth canopy like men who feared the sun was a weapon aimed personally at them.

The Travancore escort rode hard, spears upright, cloth tied tight against sweat. The English rode stiffly, as if their bodies had been built for colder air. Their red coats were bright enough to be seen from the wall, a moving stain against the green.

I watched from the parapet as they approached the gate.

English officers look younger than they are. Their faces are pale, their cheeks soft with food, their eyes quick with calculation. They are trained to hide fear behind manners. They are trained to treat a smile as a kind of armour.

The fort guards looked them over with the wary contempt soldiers reserve for men who think cloth can replace steel.

De Lannoy did not come to the wall. He waited in the yard below, in the shade of the gun shed, as if he had learned that men who arrive with ceremony must not be rewarded with too much attention.

He sent for me instead.

When I climbed down from the wall, the smell of the yard hit me, familiar and grounding. Powder residue. Oiled rope. Damp wood. Sweat and iron.

The English brought different smells. Wool. Stale wine. Leather polished for inspection. They carried the scent of ships even on land, tar and salt trapped in their cloth.

---

They were led into the gun yard with a show of courtesy that was also a show of control.

The Travancore captain of the gate walked beside the senior Englishman, smiling politely. Behind them came two more English officers, a clerk with ink-stained fingers, and a thin Indian interpreter whose eyes darted between faces as if looking for a safe place to rest.

The senior officer introduced himself in careful Portuguese.

"Major Hawkins," he said, bowing slightly. "Honourable Company's service."

His accent was poor. The vowels slid around like fish. But the effort was deliberate. Portuguese still ruled the coast's trade tongues, and the Company liked to believe language itself could be conquered by will.

De Lannoy answered in Portuguese too, smoother, older, the Portuguese of a man who had spoken it in factories and chapels and under cannon smoke.

"Captain De Lannoy," he replied. He did not give his first name. He never did with Europeans. Names are doors. He kept his closed.

Hawkins looked relieved to find a European voice answering him. His gaze slid over De Lannoy's coat, his posture, his face.

Then his eyes found me.

I saw the moment of recognition, and something else behind it.

Asset.

Lever.

Possible weakness.

Hawkins' smile widened.

"Dutch," he said, switching awkwardly into English, as if he could not resist showing he possessed the newer language too. "By God, I thought so. I knew it by the nose."

The clerk laughed dutifully.

The Travancore captain smiled without understanding.

The Indian interpreter watched my face carefully, as if he expected me to explode.

I did not.

I bowed and kept my hands still.

De Lannoy glanced at me, a small look that meant, be useful.

Hawkins held out his hand.

In that moment I saw two possible lives.

One was the life the Company offered, always. A European among Europeans. A man who could speak the right words and drink the right toasts and pretend his hands had not been remade in a foreign gun yard.

The other was the life I had chosen, even if I had never admitted it aloud. A house by the backwaters. A wife whose hands smelled of fish and turmeric. Children who spoke Malayalam with the careless confidence of the born.

Hawkins' hand waited.

I took it.

His grip was soft.

"Brother," he said, and his eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

The word sat on my skin like oil.

---

They had come, officially, to discuss an alliance.

Unofficially, they had come to measure.

They walked the wall line as if it was already theirs. They tapped stone with knuckles, glanced down at the ditch, asked questions about powder stores with the casual tone of men asking about weather. Hawkins smiled often. His junior officers smiled too, but their smiles did not reach their eyes.

One of them, a lieutenant with a narrow face and a mouth that looked permanently dissatisfied, leaned close to me as we watched a gun drill.

"Is it true," he asked in English, "that the king pays this Frenchman like a prince?"

He said Frenchman as if it were the same as traitor.

I answered in English, measured. "He is paid as an officer. He has built the king's army."

The lieutenant's eyebrows rose. "A Dutchman defending a Frenchman. Remarkable."

His gaze flicked toward my hands. The calluses. The faint powder stain that never quite left the nails.

"And you," he said. "What are you paid, van der Berg?"

There are questions that are not questions. They are hooks.

I kept my eyes on the gun crew as they rammed home the charge.

"Enough," I said.

He smiled again. "Enough is seldom enough for a man with talent."

The gun fired. The recoil slammed back. The lieutenant flinched despite himself, and then recovered with a laugh.

"Magnificent," he said, as if he had expected the gun to obey his appreciation.

---

In the shed, De Lannoy spread his maps and powder tables and let the English look.

He did not give them everything. He never gave everything. He offered enough to satisfy their pride, enough to keep them talking, enough to make them believe they were extracting secrets.

Hendrik stood behind his father, expression controlled. Caspar lingered near the doorway like a bored dog.

Hawkins asked about cannon.

"How many eighteen-pounders on the west battery?" he asked in Portuguese.

De Lannoy answered in Malayalam to the Travancore captain instead of to Hawkins, forcing Hawkins to wait for translation. It was a small cruelty, and a useful one. It reminded the Englishman whose land he stood on.

The Travancore captain answered Hawkins politely, and then Hawkins turned to me.

"Your Malayalam is excellent," he said in English. "Quite remarkable for a Dutchman."

I said nothing.

Hawkins continued as if we were already friends.

"We have need of men like you," he said. "Men who can speak to natives and still think like Europeans."

Still.

The word was a knife.

I translated a sentence for the Travancore captain and felt my jaw tighten. De Lannoy watched me from the corner of his eye.

Hawkins leaned closer.

"You should come to Madras," he said softly. "We pay properly. We promote properly. A man does not have to spend his life as a servant of heathen kings."

I heard the contempt under the politeness. He did not hate Travancore. Hate is too honest. He simply assumed it was temporary, a local inconvenience that would eventually be corrected by Company order.

I thought of Lakshmi.

If Hawkins had seen her, he would have smiled again. He would have called her picturesque. He would have spoken of her as if she was part of the scenery, like palm trees and elephants.

I looked at him and answered with the only weapon I had in that moment, truth delivered flatly.

"My children are here," I said. "My wife is here."

Hawkins' smile did not falter. It only changed.

"Ah," he said. "Entanglements."

He said it kindly, as if my life was a mistake he forgave me for making.

"Those can be managed," he continued. "Arrangements can be made. We have chaplains. We have settlements. Your children could be educated properly."

Properly.

Another knife.

I saw, in a flash, the future he offered. My son in an English coat, taught to be ashamed of his mother. My daughter taught to speak English first and Malayalam second, as if one tongue was clean and the other was dirt.

My hands clenched, then forced themselves to relax.

De Lannoy spoke then, in Portuguese, sharp enough to cut through Hawkins' soft voice.

"Major," he said, "if you have come to talk, talk to the king. If you have come to buy men, go to the markets."

Hawkins laughed, as if De Lannoy had made a joke.

"Of course," he said. "Of course. Purely professional."

He patted my shoulder lightly, as if sealing our private understanding.

The touch made my skin crawl.

---

When they left the shed, they asked to see the powder magazine.

De Lannoy refused.

He did it politely. He did it with reasons. He did it as if he were protecting the English from danger, because powder is temperamental and a careless spark can make heroes out of fools.

Hawkins accepted the refusal with a smile that was too smooth.

"Naturally," he said. "Naturally. One must be cautious."

But I saw the way his eyes tracked the wall thickness as we walked. I saw the way his clerk wrote down numbers he should not have been able to obtain. I saw the way the dissatisfied lieutenant studied our gun crews as if counting how many could be bribed.

The Company did not always arrive with cannon.

Sometimes it arrived with notebooks.

---

They were lodged that night in Padmanabhapuram, and the fort breathed easier when their red coats disappeared from the gate.

In the yard, men began to talk again. The gunners spat and made jokes about English stomachs and English noses. Caspar mimicked Hawkins' Portuguese accent until even Hendrik's mouth twitched.

De Lannoy did not laugh.

He stood with me under the eaves, watching the last smoke drift away from the guns.

"They want you," he said in Dutch.

It was not an accusation.

It was a warning.

I stared at the darkening yard. "They think I am one of them," I replied.

De Lannoy's face stayed still. "And what do you think?"

The question was simple, and it had no safe answer.

I thought of the Englishman's hand on my arm. Brother.
I thought of my children's voices mixing languages without shame.
I thought of the rocket fragments in the bowl.

"I think," I said slowly, "that they are polite because they have not yet decided whether they will need to kill us."

De Lannoy's mouth tightened. It might have been approval, or grief.

"Good," he said. "Keep thinking like that."

He turned back toward the shed.

"Tomorrow," he added, "we drill twice."

---

That night, at home, Lakshmi listened while I spoke.

She did not interrupt. She did not gasp at the idea of English offers. She did not ask whether I was tempted.

When I finished, she took a pinch of salt and rubbed it into the fish as if salt could fix what words could not.

"They looked at you like a thing," she said finally.

She understood predation. Every woman does.

"Yes," I admitted.

Lakshmi nodded, as if the answer confirmed what she already knew.

"Then you must learn to be a thing that bites," she said.

She said it calmly, the way she said everything that mattered.

Outside, the backwater was dark and still.

Somewhere beyond the trees, in places I could not see, men were counting too.
