# Chapter 23: Lakshmi's Wisdom

When I came home from the Lines, my boots were full of mud and my head was full of bitterness.

Mud can be washed away.

Bitterness sinks in.

Lakshmi met me at the door and did not ask questions at first. She only took one look at my face and walked back inside, as if she had already decided what kind of evening it would be.

The house smelled of cooked rice and fish drying near the hearth. A lamp burned in the corner, its flame small and steady. Our children were on the floor with a wooden wheel, rolling it back and forth and arguing in the careless way only children can argue, as if the world will always have time for play.

Willem looked up when I entered.

"Father," he said, and there was hesitation in his voice now, as if he had learned that his father's return carried moods as well as stories.

Anna ran to me anyway, and pressed her damp hair against my coat.

"You smell like rain," she said, delighted.

Little Thomas stared at my boots and made a face.

"You brought the swamp," he announced.

I almost laughed.

Almost.

Lakshmi pointed at my boots.

"Outside," she said.

I obeyed.

I sat on the step and pulled the boots off, the mud sucking at leather. I scraped the worst of it away with a piece of wood and set the boots by the door, as if leaving the mud there would also leave the day's thoughts.

It did not.

When I came back inside, Lakshmi had already placed food on a leaf plate and set a cup of water beside it.

"Eat," she said.

Her voice was not gentle. It was practical.

I ate, because hunger is not improved by self-pity.

Lakshmi watched me for a while, her eyes steady, and then she spoke.

"Hendrik spoke to you," she said, watching my face.

I swallowed a mouthful of rice that tasted of nothing.

"Yes," I admitted.

Lakshmi nodded.

"He made you feel small," she said.

The words hit with uncomfortable accuracy.

"He reminded me of what I am," I said, trying to make it sound like philosophy instead of hurt.

Lakshmi's mouth tightened.

"Do not make your pain elegant," she said. "It is still pain."

The children quieted slightly, listening. Lakshmi looked at them and softened her voice by a fraction.

"Go to the back room," she told them. "Play there."

Willem hesitated, eyes flicking between us. Then he gathered the wooden wheel and shepherded Anna and Thomas toward the sleeping room.

When the curtain fell closed behind them, the house seemed to exhale.

Lakshmi sat opposite me and picked up a piece of fish, breaking it with her fingers.

"Tell me," she said.

So I did.

I told her about the whip in the mud.
I told her about Hendrik's calm voice.
I told her the sentence that had lodged under my ribs.

Do not mistake the bridge for the crown.

When I finished, I expected sympathy.

Sympathy is what I had learned to expect from women in European stories.

Lakshmi did not give me that.

She chewed the fish slowly, then swallowed, then looked at me as if deciding whether I was being foolish on purpose.

"You want the crown?" she asked.

The question was so blunt it made my face heat.

"No," I said quickly. "I do not want to command."

Lakshmi raised one eyebrow.

"Then why are you sulking like a boy whose toy was taken?" she asked.

The words stung.

They also made something in me loosen, because the sting was honest.

"Because," I said, and my voice sounded smaller than I wanted, "I have done the work. I have held the guns. I have learned the maps. I have bled in this land. And still, when the weight passes, it will not pass to me."

Lakshmi stared at me for a long moment.

Then she leaned forward slightly.

"Listen to me," she said.

Her voice was quiet now, and that quiet carried more force than shouting.

"You think too much about where you came from," she said. "Think about where you are."

The sentence landed in the room like a stone.

I opened my mouth to argue, and Lakshmi lifted her hand.

"Where you came from is a Company that would have left you in a ditch," she continued. "Where you came from is a church that would call my children bastards. Where you came from is men who count pepper and call it honour."

She pointed toward the back room where our children whispered.

"Where you are is a house that you built with your hands," she said. "Where you are is a land that lets you eat, and work, and raise children, even if it looks at you sideways."

Her eyes held mine.

"Where you are is me," she added, and her voice softened, not into sweetness, but into something more dangerous.

Truth.

I felt my throat tighten.

Lakshmi reached across the mat and took my hand.

Her fingers were warm and callused from work. Not soft. Not decorative.

"You are angry because Hendrik will be the name," she said. "And you will be the hands."

I did not deny it.

Lakshmi squeezed my hand.

"Names are for priests," she said. "Hands feed children."

She paused, then added, "And bridges keep people from drowning."

The last line surprised me.

I stared at her.

Lakshmi's mouth twitched, the smallest hint of a smile.

"Do you think a crown is heavy?" she asked. "Try being a bridge. Everyone walks on you. No one thanks you. But if you break, they all fall into the water."

She released my hand and sat back.

"So do not break," she said simply.

The words were not romantic.

They were a command.

And they were the closest thing to comfort she had ever given me.

---

Later, when the children were asleep, Lakshmi and I sat on the step and listened to the backwater.

The rain had eased. Frogs called. Somewhere a night bird cried once, sharp and lonely.

Lakshmi leaned her head against my shoulder, a rare gesture, and I felt the weight of her trust settle on me.

Not a crown.

A different weight.

The weight of being needed.

In the dark, I could see the outline of the fort wall against the sky.

I thought of Hendrik, walking the line with his hands clasped behind his back, building fear into men like mortar.

I thought of Caspar, hungry for meaning, burning himself to feel alive.

I thought of De Lannoy, fraying slowly, leaving his work behind.

And I thought of Lakshmi's hands in mine.

Hands feed children.

Bridges keep people from drowning.

Perhaps that was belonging.
