# Chapter 2: Smoke at Colachel

Salt wind always carries a warning.

The men who had grown up in Batavia's humid heat did not know that. They complained about the grit in their teeth and the way the sea air made the powder go sour if you were careless. They cursed the palms and the glare and the strange green coast that refused to look like the Indies they thought they understood.

The older soldiers from Zeeland and Amsterdam knew better. They tasted that wind and kept their mouths shut. A sea that smells of iron and rotting weed is a sea that has watched too many men die.

I was sixteen years old and did not yet know how to read weather properly. I learned at Colachel.

---

We camped on sand that never cooled.

The day before the battle, we had dragged our guns into position by sweating oxen and sweating men, ropes cutting into palms, wheels sinking and jerking as if the earth itself resisted our arrogance. The officers shouted in Dutch and bad Portuguese. The sepoys answered in languages I did not recognise. Somewhere beyond them, in the palm shadow, local guides watched with eyes like shutters.

Our expedition had come from Ceylon with confidence packed into every crate. We had sailed down with orders, silver, and the certainty that the petty kingdoms of the Malabar coast would fold the way they always folded when a European company pressed hard enough. We had a governor's signature. We had a factor's promises. We had cannon, disciplined infantry, and a commander who had fought in Europe.

That commander was Eustachius De Lannoy.

Even then he did not belong among us.

He spoke Dutch with a Walloon drawl that stretched vowels and softened consonants until the language sounded foreign in his mouth. The Zeelanders winced when he gave orders. The men from Amsterdam called him "the Frenchman" as if it were a curse, though he was Flemish and would correct them coldly when he heard it. He crossed himself before meals. He kept a small rosary hidden in his coat and pretended not to know that the other officers laughed about it when he was out of earshot.

In the Company, a Catholic could rise if he was useful. He could command if he won. But he would never be invited fully into the room. The wars of religion were a century past, but the hatred lingered like smoke in old cloth.

I had been taught to distrust men like him. My father had been a trader, my mother a woman whose ancestry was spoken of only in hints, and in our household Lutheran certainty had been one of the few clean lines. Catholics were the enemy in Europe, the corruptors of the Portuguese and Spanish, the men who brought priests into trade the way a surgeon brings a knife into flesh.

When De Lannoy inspected our guns, I watched him the way you watch a loose rope in a storm. Useful until it snaps, and then fatal.

He paused by my gun that afternoon, a six-pounder mounted on a creaking carriage. I was the youngest on the crew, small enough to crawl where older men could not, quick enough to move powder and shot without needing to be kicked.

"You," he said, pointing with his riding crop.

I stiffened, waiting to be blamed for something. Part of me hoped he would give me a reason to hate him more openly.

"What is the range at two degrees elevation, standard charge, with this bore and barrel length?" he asked, as if we were in a classroom rather than a war camp.

I blinked. The other men shifted, impatient. I knew how to load, how to swab, how to stand clear of the recoil. I did not know the mathematics.

"I do not know, sir," I said.

His eyes narrowed. Not anger. Calculation. The same look a merchant gives a bolt of cloth, assessing worth.

"Six hundred yards," he said. "Give or take for wind and powder quality. You should know that. Every man on a gun crew should know the numbers, not just the motions." He tapped the barrel with his crop. "War is arithmetic. The rest is noise."

Then he moved on, leaving me with the taste of shame and salt. I told myself his accent made him sound like a schoolmaster, and that schoolmasters were not to be respected. It was a child's thought. I was a child.

That night I lay awake under a canvas that stank of damp and old sweat. I listened to the sea and told myself the next day would be like the drills. We would form, fire, advance, and the locals would run. I told myself the Company did not lose to men in cotton and bare feet.

In the morning, the cannons taught me humility.

---

At dawn the coastline looked almost gentle.

Mist lay over the palms. The sea was a dull pewter, ruffled by wind that tugged at flags and turned the campfires into ribbons of smoke. Our men stood in line, bayonets fixed, coats already stained with sweat. The guns were loaded. The powder casks were covered with cloth to keep the damp out. Drummers beat a steady rhythm that made the heart believe in order.

De Lannoy rode along the line once, slow, his expression unreadable. He did not give a speech. He did not promise glory. He only pointed with his crop and adjusted distances, shifting a gun a foot to the left, moving a squad half a pace back as if he could see the battle already and was correcting it before it happened.

Ahead, beyond the dunes, the Travancorean line formed.

They did not look like the scattered levies our factors had described. They were not a handful of spear men trembling behind palm trunks. They came in blocks, ranks deep, matchlocks and muskets held with practised hands. Their flags moved above them, bright against the grey morning. Between their infantry, I saw guns, more than we had expected, their barrels catching the first light.

The first time I heard their drums, I understood we were not the only ones who believed in order.

Someone near me muttered a prayer. It might have been Catholic. It might have been Lutheran. In the mouth of a frightened man, the difference does not matter.

The Travancorean guns spoke first.

There was no formal challenge, no polite exchange of opening volleys the way European manuals pretended war should begin. One moment the morning was full of wind and drumbeats, the next it was full of iron.

The ball that took the head off the man two places to my left made a sound I have never forgotten. It was not a heroic sound. It was a wet crack, like a ripe fruit smashed on stone, followed by a spray that painted the sand dark.

Men screamed. Drummers stumbled. Someone dropped his match.

We fired back.

Our guns roared, and for a moment I felt relief. The familiar recoil, the smoke, the way the barrel jumped and settled. The world narrowing to a simple sequence: sponge, load, ram, prime, fire. Arithmetic. Noise.

Then their second volley came in and tore through our line again.

The Travancorean gunners did not fire wildly. They fired with purpose. They had ranges. They had angles. They had officers who knew what they were doing. Through the smoke, I caught glimpses of their crews - swabbing, loading, ramming, priming - and they moved faster than we did. Someone had drilled them. Someone had taught them the arithmetic.

I thought of De Lannoy's question, his calm voice reciting numbers I had not bothered to learn. Six hundred yards. The Travancorean guns were hitting us from further than that.

One of our guns took a hit on the carriage and flipped sideways, the barrel rolling in the sand like a dead animal. The crew scattered. A man tried to grab the trail and was crushed under the wheel.

Our infantry tried to advance, bayonets out, a square of disciplined cloth marching into smoke.

The smoke thickened until I could barely see the next gun.

Orders became fragments. "Hold." "Forward." "Reload." "Jesus." "Godverdomme."

The sea vanished behind a curtain of powder. The palms became ghosts. The air tasted of sulphur and salt and panic.

I ran ammunition until my arms shook.

Shot, then powder, then wadding. I counted the steps between the powder cask and the gun because counting gave the mind something to cling to.

On the third run, I slipped in blood and fell hard on my knees. The sand was warm. The blood was warmer.

I looked up and saw De Lannoy through the smoke.

He was on foot now, his horse gone, his coat torn at the sleeve. He stood near the centre of the line, shouting orders that were swallowed by cannon thunder. He pointed, corrected, rallied. He moved like a man trying to hold back a tide with his hands.

For the first time, I saw fear on his face.

Not cowardice. Not panic. Fear as information. Fear as recognition.

This was a battle we could lose.

And in that moment, blood on my hands and sand in my teeth, I hated him. Hated the papist who had led us here. Hated the Frenchman whose arithmetic had failed. I did not yet understand that the failure was not his, that no amount of calculation could have saved us from our own arrogance. I only knew that a Catholic had brought good Lutheran boys to die on a heathen beach, and that felt like reason enough for hatred.

---

It ended the way most battles end.

Not with a clean moment of decision, not with a flag lowered and a formal surrender. It ended with collapse.

Our left flank buckled first. Travancorean cavalry, light and fast, appeared out of the smoke and cut into men who could not see them until steel was already inside the ribs. Our infantry tried to turn and present bayonets, but turning under fire is never orderly. A line becomes a knot. A knot becomes a rout.

Someone shouted to fall back.

Someone shouted to stand.

Men did both, and in doing both they did neither.

I remember a face, a boy like me, eyes wide behind powder-black lashes, his mouth opening to speak. A ball took him mid-sentence and threw him backwards as if he was a doll.

I remember the smell of burning coir as a hut caught fire near the dunes.

I remember stumbling over a body and realising it was still warm, still moving, still trying to breathe with half a chest.

Then I remember pain.

It was a hard, blunt pain in my side, like being hit by a club. I looked down and saw blood soaking my coat. I had not even heard the shot that found me. That is how battle teaches you your own smallness. It does not announce itself. It simply takes.

I tried to keep moving. My legs obeyed for a few steps, then did not.

The sand rose to meet me.

Somewhere above, men ran. Feet thudded. A horse screamed. The world shook with cannon fire.

I lay on my back and watched smoke drift across the sky, grey on grey. A palm frond fluttered like a torn flag.

I thought of Batavia, of canals and tiled roofs I had never seen, of my mother humming in a language that was not Dutch. The memory felt like someone else's life.

Then a shadow fell across me.

I tried to raise my knife. My hand moved an inch and stopped.

A man stood over me with a curved sword and a cloth wrapped around his head. His skin was dark, his eyes brighter than the morning. He looked at me with something like disgust, then spat beside my head.

He said something in Malayalam. I did not understand the words. I understood the tone.

Two more men came. They hauled me up by the shoulders and dragged me toward the rear, my boots leaving furrows in the sand. Each jolt sent fire through my side. I bit down on my tongue until I tasted blood and metal.

We passed bodies. Dutch bodies. Travancorean bodies. Men were equal in death, lined up on the same sand.

As they dragged me, I saw De Lannoy again.

He was on his knees in the sand, hands bound, his face smeared with soot. A Travancorean officer stood behind him, speaking calmly, as if they were discussing trade rather than defeat. De Lannoy's jaw was clenched. His eyes were fixed on the horizon, where Dutch ships sat useless in the grey sea.

He did not look at me.

I hated him for that too. For the battle, for the defeat, for the way he knelt there like a man already calculating his next move while boys like me bled into the sand. The papist. The Frenchman. The traitor who would sell his sword to anyone who paid.

I did not know then that I would become exactly like him.

---

I woke in a room that smelled of damp stone and rotting straw.

For a moment I thought I was in Batavia again, fevered in my mother's arms. Then pain dragged me back. My side throbbed. My mouth was dry. My wrists ached where rope had rubbed them raw.

There were other men in the room, groaning, coughing, praying. The wounded smell of human beings packed together in heat and fear is the same in every prison.

The light came through a small opening high in the wall. Through it I could hear birds, bright and indifferent.

Someone had cleaned the wound and packed it with cloth. Someone had decided I was worth keeping alive.

I did not know why.

Days blurred. They brought rice water and a thin gruel that tasted of smoke. They dragged the worst wounded out and did not bring them back. At night, rats came bold as officers and ran over our legs.

Once, a priest entered. Not a European priest. A Brahmin with ash on his forehead and a voice like dry leaves. He looked at us as if we were cattle. He spoke to a guard, pointed at two men, and those men were taken away.

I did not see them again.

When the door closed, someone began to sob, a low animal sound that made the hair on my arms rise.

I learned to measure time by artillery.

Not battle artillery, but training. Every morning, somewhere above, guns were fired. Not in anger. In drill. The sound was steady, disciplined, intentional. This fort, whoever owned it now, still believed in mathematics.

On the seventh day, the door opened and a familiar voice spoke my name.

"Pieter van der Berg."

I pushed myself up, dizzy, and turned.

De Lannoy stood in the doorway.

He did not wear a Dutch coat. He wore local cloth, but he carried himself with the same straight-backed precision. Two Travancorean soldiers stood behind him. They did not hold him. They guarded him.

For a moment my mind refused to accept what my eyes were telling it.

He looked at the room, at the men, at the blood-stained straw. His face did not soften. Pity was not one of his tools.

His eyes stopped on me.

"Stand," he said.

I tried. My legs shook. I got to my feet anyway, because a boy in the Company learns quickly that you obey officers even when your body argues.

De Lannoy stepped closer. He studied my face as if it was a map.

"You were on the guns," he said.

"Yes, sir."

"You have hands that move quickly, and you count without realising you are counting." His gaze dropped to my fingers. "You will work for me."

The words hit like a second wound.

"Work?" I managed.

"Work," he repeated. "Not chains. Not the rope. Not the knife." His voice lowered, as if the walls might be listening. "Learn, and live. That is the offer. It is the only offer."

Behind him, one of the Travancorean soldiers shifted his spear.

De Lannoy kept his eyes on mine.

"Decide," he said.

My stomach twisted. Pride rose, hot and useless. So did fear, cold and clean.

Outside, a cannon fired, the sound rolling through stone like distant thunder.

I thought of the sand at Colachel, of bodies lined like broken dolls, of the moment the world collapsed into smoke.

I swallowed. My mouth tasted of straw and blood.

"Yes," I said.

De Lannoy nodded, as if confirming a calculation he had already made.

"Good," he replied. "Come."

And I followed the man I had hated - the papist, the Frenchman, the traitor - out of the prison and into the life I did not yet understand.

The Lutheran boy stayed behind in that cell. He died there, I think, with the others who could not bend. What walked out was something else. Something that would learn to sit in a Catholic's chapel, marry a Nair woman, and serve a Hindu king. Something that would forget how to pray in any language.

Something that would become exactly what it had despised.

But that was later. That morning, I only knew that I was alive, and that alive was better than the alternative.

I followed De Lannoy into the sunlight, and I did not look back.
