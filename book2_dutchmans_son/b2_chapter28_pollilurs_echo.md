# Chapter 28: Pollilur's Echo

In 1780, Pollilur reached Travancore as a sickness.

At first it was a rumour, carried by merchants who had never seen a battlefield but could smell panic on the roads. They spoke of an English Company column destroyed. Of a defeat so complete that even Madras had gone quiet.

Then came the dispatch.

Paper, again.

Paper that felt heavier than cannon.

---

The courier arrived at Udayagiri at midday, his horse lathered, his own face grey with exhaustion.

He carried a packet sealed in red wax with the English Company's mark.

Hendrik broke the seal in the shed and read the first lines.

His face did not change, but I saw his fingers tighten on the paper.

He handed it to me without speaking.

The letter was in English, written in a hurried hand, the kind of hand that has been forced to write while men are still dying somewhere nearby.

Colonel Baillie's detachment destroyed near Pollilur.
Company infantry squares broken.
Heavy casualties.
Rockets employed in great number.

I read the lines twice.

The shed felt too small.

Outside, the fort yard continued.

Men laughed.
Guns were cleaned.
A boy carried water.

The world was behaving as if a truth had not just arrived that should have changed everything.

Hendrik watched my face.

"Tell me," he said in Dutch.

So I did.

As I translated, I heard my own voice sound wrong, as if I were reading a death sentence in a language that could not fully hold it.

When I finished, Hendrik was silent for a long moment.

Then he looked at the courier.

"Did you see it?" he asked in Portuguese.

The courier swallowed.

"I did not," he said. "But I brought a man who did."

He gestured toward the yard.

Two sepoys stepped into the shed carrying another man between them.

The man was wrapped in cloth stained with old blood.

His face was burnt on one side, the skin tight and shiny. His left eye was swollen shut.

He smelled of smoke that had been in him for days.

The sepoys lowered him onto the floor.

The wounded man tried to sit up, pride fighting pain.

"I can speak," he rasped in Malayalam.

His accent was coastal.

He was not a Tamil from Madras.

He was one of ours.

That detail hit me harder than the dispatch.

If Pollilur could reach into our blood, then the war was already here.

---

His name was Raman.

He was a havildar in Company service, a man who had learned European drill and carried it in his bones.

He looked at Hendrik, then at me, eyes fever-bright.

"You are the Parangi gunner," he said, voice hoarse. "The one who serves the king."

I nodded.

Raman swallowed and began to speak, and as he spoke I realised he had been holding the story inside him like a burning coal. He needed to put it somewhere else.

"We marched to join the main force," he said. "Colonel Baillie. We were late. The sun was cruel. The men were thirsty. We were carrying powder and provisions in carts, and the wheels sank in sand."

His voice tightened.

"Hyder's men watched us," he continued. "We knew they were there. We could smell them."

He paused, breathing hard, then forced himself onward.

"They attacked in the morning," he said. "Cavalry first. They came like a wave."

His uninjured hand moved, making the shape in the air.

"We formed square," he said, and there was a reverence in his voice, the reverence of a man speaking of the one thing he trusted.

"Perfect square," he added, as if precision could save.

He looked at me, eyes intense.

"You know square," he said.

"Yes," I replied.

Raman nodded. "Bayonets out. Officers inside. Drums beating. We fired volleys. The cavalry could not break us. They circled. They charged again. They fell."

His voice lifted for a moment, pride rising.

"We held," he said.

Then his face changed.

The pride drained away like blood from a cut.

"Then the rockets came," he whispered.

The shed went still.

Even the courier stopped breathing.

Raman's eyes went distant, as if he was no longer in Udayagiri but back in that dry heat with smoke in his lungs.

"They came in hundreds," he said. "Not a few. Not scouts. Teams. Lines of men lighting fuses like they were lighting lamps."

His hand trembled.

"They screamed," he said. "The sky screamed."

He swallowed hard.

"The first rockets fell outside the square," he continued. "They burst in sand. Iron flew. Men were hit in legs. In arms. We tightened. Officers shouted to hold."

He laughed then, a thin broken sound.

"Hold," he repeated. "Hold is what they always say."

His voice dropped again.

"Then one rocket came over the corner," he said. "It did not miss. It came into the square."

I felt cold spread down my spine.

Raman's breath hitched.

"It hit a powder cart," he said. "A cart inside the square. We kept it inside because we thought it was safe."

His eyes filled, but no tears fell.

"The cart exploded," he whispered.

The word exploded was too small for what he described.

"The square became fire," he said. "Men became fire. The bayonets were still pointing out, but inside was burning."

He closed his good eye briefly, and when he opened it the look in it was the look of a man who has seen a truth that cannot be unseen.

"We could not breathe," he said. "Smoke trapped. Screaming trapped. The officers shouted to hold formation while the formation was burning."

He shook his head.

"Then the cavalry came again," he said. "Not to break the square. To push the burning men."

His voice cracked.

"We tried to open," he said. "We tried to run. But a square is a cage. The men in the middle died first because they had nowhere to go."

He stared at the floor.

"Discipline became a way to die neatly," he said.

The sentence landed in me like shot.

I had heard echoes of it before in rumours and wounds.

Now it was spoken by a man whose skin had been burned by that neat death.

Raman lifted his gaze to Hendrik.

"Colonel Baillie died," he said. "Many officers died. Some ran. Most of us ran. Not because we were cowards. Because we were on fire."

He looked at me again.

"The rockets did not have to hit every man," he said quietly. "They only had to hit enough."

Enough.

The word again.

---

When Raman finished, the shed was silent.

Hendrik's face was pale.

The courier stared at the floor.

I felt my hands shaking and forced them still by gripping the edge of the table.

I had admired the square once.

I had seen it as a symbol of European discipline, a proof that training could overcome fear.

Now I saw it as a target.

A perfect shape for rockets to find.

I looked at the rough map of the Lines pinned to the shed wall.

I saw, suddenly, every place where we had been tempted to build neatness.

Neat ranks.
Neat drills.
Neat confidence.

All of it was a gift to Mysore.

Raman coughed, a wet ugly sound.

Blood flecked his lip.

The healer, who had been waiting near the door, stepped forward with water and cloth.

Raman drank, then grabbed my wrist weakly.

"Do not form square," he whispered.

His fingers were light on my skin, but the urgency was heavy.

"Do not give them targets," he said. "Do not let men stand close when the sky can burn."

I nodded, because there was nothing else I could do.

---

That night I rewrote the fort's doctrine.

Not in speeches.

In orders.

Gunners dispersed. Covered positions. Traverses between batteries to break blast.
Infantry drilled to take cover, not to stand proud.
No tight formations on open ground.
Rocket crews targeted first. Aim for the flash of launch. Counter-battery fire without hesitation.

Hendrik came into the shed before midnight and found me writing.

He read my notes without speaking.

When he finished, he looked at me.

"This is not European drill," he said.

"Europe does not own discipline," I replied.

Hendrik's jaw tightened.

"My father built this fort with European knowledge," he said.

"He built it with what worked," I said. "If it stops working, we change."

Hendrik stared at the paper as if it were an insult.

Then, slowly, he nodded.

"Do it," he said.

He turned to leave, then stopped at the door.

"Raman," he said, voice low, almost reluctant. "Will he live?"

I hesitated.

"I do not know," I admitted.

Hendrik's shoulders tensed, then settled.

"Then keep him alive if you can," he said.

It was the closest Hendrik came to tenderness.

He left the shed.

I sat alone with the paper, the ink still wet.

In the distance, beyond the wall, the jungle was quiet.

But now I could hear rockets in that quiet.

Not the sound itself.

The possibility.

Pollilur had not happened in Travancore.

But its echo had reached us.

And I knew, with a certainty that tasted like smoke, that the Lines would be tested.
