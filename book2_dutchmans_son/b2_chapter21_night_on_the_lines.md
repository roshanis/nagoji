# Chapter 21: Night on the Lines

Monsoon work is a lesson in humiliation.

In the dry season, men build walls like they are writing their names into the earth. They stand tall. They shout. They talk about endurance and pride.

In the rains, the land reminds you that it does not care about pride.

Mud sucks at your feet and steals your boots.
Lantern light turns every raindrop into a flashing blade.
Powder clumps if you breathe on it wrong.
Rope goes slick.
Wood swells and warps.

And still the wall must be built.

---

I spent three nights that month at the Lines, sleeping under canvas that leaked, waking to the sound of men cursing softly as they dug.

The ditch had deepened. The earthen rampart had grown taller. Stakes had been driven into the ground at angles meant to break a charge and slow a ladder. Covered magazines were being built, small and precious, because I would not allow powder to sit in open air after what fire had almost done to us.

The gunners hated it.

They hated carrying barrels under tarpaulins. They hated guarding magazines instead of firing guns. They hated the way I insisted on slow careful handling even when rain made everything slippery.

They did it anyway.

Discipline is not love.

It is habit learned in fear.

On the third night, the habit was tested.

---

The attack began with silence.

Not a dramatic silence.

The ordinary silence of rain swallowing sound.

Men dug. Lanterns swung. A sentry walked the half-finished parapet, his spear tip glinting when lightning flickered behind clouds.

I was in a small covered gun position on a newly raised bastion, two six-pounders set behind a rough earthwork, their barrels oiled and covered when not in use.

Hendrik had wanted heavier guns on the line, but the ground was still settling. A heavy cannon on wet earth is a promise to sink.

Six-pounders were light enough to be moved.

Light enough to be fired quickly.

That night, speed mattered more than weight.

The gun crew with me was young. Their faces shone with rain and sweat. One boy held the slow match under a leather cover to keep it from hissing out.

I listened to the rain and tried to imagine what the jungle looked like beyond the ditch.

You cannot see far in monsoon night.

You see only what comes close enough to kill you.

Then a lantern in the ditch line flickered and went out.

A second later, a sentry's shout cut through the rain.

"Men!"

The shout turned into a gurgle.

Then came the sound of bodies struggling in mud.

And then a torch flared in the dark, sudden and bright.

It moved fast, low to the ground.

Not a labourer's torch.

A raider's.

---

The men came out of the rain like a swarm.

Not hundreds. Not an army.

Scouts.

Thirty, maybe forty, moving in a loose rush, their cloth dark, their faces indistinct. They carried swords and matchlocks, and a few carried bundles on their backs that could have been tools or could have been rockets.

They aimed for the unfinished section where the ditch was shallower and the palisade was still being raised.

They knew the line.

They had been watching.

My mouth went dry.

I shouted in Malayalam.

"To the guns. Now."

The boy with the slow match fumbled and nearly dropped it. I grabbed his wrist hard enough to steady him.

"Hold it," I hissed. "Like you want to live."

The crew moved, suddenly awake.

Sponge.
Load.
Ram.

Their hands were slick. The rammer nearly slipped. I forced myself not to shout. Shouting does not dry hands.

Outside, men were screaming in the ditch, and in those screams I heard the sound that matters most in a fight.

Panic.

Panic spreads faster than fire.

---

The raiders reached the ditch.

Some jumped in and began to scramble up the far side, slipping in mud.

Others threw bundles into it, trying to fill it quickly.

One man carried a clay pot with a cloth wick. He hurled it toward the palisade.

It shattered and oil splashed, slick and black, and for a moment the rain could not wash it away.

Then flame caught, stubborn, alive even in wet air.

That flame gave me what I needed.

Light.

I swung the six-pounder slightly, aiming not for one man but for the knot of bodies trying to climb the ditch.

"Grape," I ordered.

The gunner's eyes widened.

Grapeshot at this range was not war.

It was slaughter.

"Grape," I repeated, voice hard.

The gunner obeyed, hands moving fast.

The canvas bag of iron balls slid into the barrel.

The boy with the match leaned in, face tense, eyes blinking against rain.

I felt the whole crew hold its breath.

"Fire," I said.

The match touched the vent.

The gun spoke.

In monsoon night, a cannon flash is like lightning made by men.

The recoil slammed back. The carriage jolted, wheels skidding in mud.

The sound rolled down the line and into the jungle, and for a moment everything was visible.

Men in the ditch, mouths open.
Faces twisted in surprise.
Hands gripping wet earth.

Then the grapeshot hit.

The sound was different from a round shot.

Round shot makes a clean brutal impact.

Grapeshot makes a tearing sound, like iron fists punching into meat and bone.

The knot of bodies in the ditch collapsed inward.

Some men fell without a sound.

Some screamed and tried to crawl over the dead.

The ditch filled with movement, then with stillness.

The raiders hesitated.

Hesitation is a gift.

I took it.

"Again," I ordered.

The crew moved like a machine, fear turning them faster.

Sponge.
Load.
Ram.

The boy's hands shook so hard he spilled powder. I slapped his hand away and used my own fingers to wipe the spill, smearing it into mud.

Not tonight.

Not here.

We primed and fired again, aiming lower, sweeping the ditch line.

The second blast shredded the men who had been climbing and the men who had been pushing from behind.

The raiders broke.

Not all at once.

In small pieces.

A man turning away.
A man dragging another.
A torch dropped into mud, hissing out.

They ran back into the rain.

---

On the unfinished section, Travancore spearmen surged forward, shouting, stabbing down into the ditch at men who still moved.

The raiders fired matchlocks blindly as they retreated. One ball struck the palisade with a dull thud. Another hit a labourer in the shoulder and spun him around. He fell into mud and did not get up.

For a moment I thought I heard a rocket scream.

It might have been imagination.

It might have been wind through bamboo.

In monsoon night, everything sounds like a threat.

Then the sound faded, and only rain remained.

The raiders vanished into the jungle as quickly as they had appeared.

They had not come to win.

They had come to taste the wall.

To see whether it would bleed.

It had.

But it had not broken.

---

When the firing stopped, the darkness returned with a weight that felt physical.

Lanterns were relit along the line, their flames sheltered with trembling hands.

Men moved in the ditch, pulling bodies out, checking for breath, dragging the wounded toward the shelter where the healer waited with boiled water and cloth.

The ditch water was red-brown, rain and earth and blood mixing into one colour.

I climbed down from the bastion and walked the ditch line.

My boots sank. Mud sucked at my heels. The smell of powder hung in the air, sharp against wet earth.

The first body I saw was a young man, no older than my eldest son, his eyes open, his mouth filled with mud. An iron ball had taken him in the throat.

I stared at him longer than I should have.

A gunner's mind cannot help counting.

One discharge. Six-pounder. Grape load.
At this range, the pattern is tight.
The ditch becomes a funnel.

I could see, in my head, the spread of iron, the angles, the way bodies had collapsed where the shot cloud had been thickest.

I hated myself for that clarity.

I also knew the clarity was why the wall had held.

Hendrik arrived with rain on his hair, his face pale in lantern light.

"How many?" he asked.

I looked down the ditch.

"Seventeen," I said.

Hendrik's jaw tightened. "Ours?"

"Three," I replied. "One labourer. Two spearmen."

Hendrik nodded, satisfied in a way that made my stomach twist.

Numbers are comforting to men who want to believe war is manageable.

Caspar appeared then, dripping wet, sword in hand, as if he had run from wherever he had been sleeping the moment the first gun spoke.

His eyes went to the ditch, to the bodies, to the torn mud.

He did not make a joke.

That was how I knew it had reached him.

"They came to learn," he said finally, voice low.

I nodded.

Caspar's gaze moved to the wall line, still half built, still fragile.

"Then we must teach them something worth remembering," he said.

It was the first time he had spoken like a man who understood war was not only about feeling alive.

It was also about keeping others alive.

---

Later, when the bodies had been dragged away and the ditch had been scraped and the palisade fire had been smothered, I stood on the bastion again and looked into the rain.

The jungle beyond the cleared line was black and silent.

Somewhere inside it, men were walking back to Mysore with wet clothes and empty hands.

They would tell their officers what they had seen.

Guns under cover.
Grapeshot.
Men who fired fast in rain.

They would come back with a better plan.

That was what made Hyder different.

He learned.

As I stood there, I realised I was learning too.

Not about rockets.

About myself.

I had fired grape into men in a ditch and then counted bodies like a clerk.

I had measured death by accuracy.

The rain washed my face, cold and steady, and it did not cleanse anything.
