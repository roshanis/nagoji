# Chapter 16: The First Mysore War

War reaches you before the army does.

It arrives as rumours in a market. As a missing merchant. As a price that suddenly rises. As a letter carried by a man whose horse has foam on its flanks.

By the time the banners appear on the horizon, the war has already been living in your house for months.

The First Mysore War reached Travancore that way.

Not with cannon.

With paper.

---

In 1767, an English Company courier rode into Padmanabhapuram with dust in his hair and arrogance in his posture.

He brought letters sealed in red wax and spoke as if he were delivering gifts.

Hyder Ali had moved east, the courier said. He had threatened Company interests. The Company and its allies would respond. Allies were expected to cooperate.

Expected.

The word carried the shape of the future.

Raja Kesavadas received the courier with court politeness and dismissed him with promises that sounded like agreement and meant nothing of the sort.

But even in refusal, war leaves fingerprints.

Within weeks, English Company soldiers began to appear on roads near Travancore, marching north and west, their red coats flashing through green like warning flowers. Sepoys followed, brown faces under Company officers' commands, the sound of their boots and drums carrying through villages that had known only temple bells.

One afternoon an English Company detachment camped in a field two miles from Udayagiri, and Hendrik rode out to observe them.

He took me with him.

"You speak their tongue," he said, as if that explained everything.

It did not.

---

They had set up their camp with the neatness of men who believed neatness was a form of control.

Tents in rows. Cooking fires contained in shallow pits. Sentries posted at measured distances. A flagpole set up in the centre like a declaration.

Major Hawkins was there, his smile polished, his boots clean despite the mud.

"Captain De Lannoy's man," he greeted me, as if I belonged to De Lannoy the way a tool belongs to a hand. "Good to see you again, brother."

The word again.

I bowed and kept my face still.

Hawkins guided us toward the drill ground with the pride of a man showing off a machine.

"We will demonstrate for you," he said. "So you can see what proper infantry can do."

Proper.

He said it without malice.

That made it worse.

The sepoys formed ranks, muskets on shoulders, bayonets fixed. Their faces were set, disciplined, but I could see fear in the corners of their eyes. Fear is always present. Discipline is what you build around it.

The Company officers walked along the line, tapping muskets, adjusting a strap, correcting a stance.

Then a drum beat, and the whole formation moved.

They shifted from line into square with the clean efficiency of men who had practised until thought was no longer required. Four faces of muskets. Bayonets bristling outward. Officers in the centre. Colours held high.

I felt a cold appreciation in my chest.

Squares are ugly things. They are not meant for beauty. They are meant to stop cavalry. A wall of steel that can move.

Hawkins watched my face and smiled, pleased.

"You see," he said. "Cavalry cannot break that."

As if cavalry was the only thing a man needed to fear.

Hendrik watched too, eyes narrowed. He respected discipline even when it came wrapped in arrogance.

On Hawkins' signal, a group of Company horsemen trotted forward, not charging, only approaching, and the square held, muskets steady, bayonets outward.

The horses did not like it. Horses understand steel. They snorted and shifted, ears flicking, refusing to press their bodies into a hedge of points.

The demonstration ended with laughter and applause from the Company officers.

Hawkins turned to me.

"Tell your king," he said, "that the Company is strong. We will handle Mysore."

I translated his words into Malayalam for Hendrik, and I watched Hendrik's expression tighten.

Strong.

Handle.

The verbs were too certain.

On the ride back to Udayagiri, Hendrik spoke little.

When he did speak, it was in Dutch, as if he wanted the language to make the thought more precise.

"A square is impressive," he admitted.

I nodded. "It is," I replied.

Hendrik glanced at me. "But?"

I thought of Sadiq's words.

Aim for neatness.

"A square is also a target," I said.

Hendrik frowned. He did not like answers that were not neat.

---

The news from the north came in fragments.

A merchant who had seen smoke rising beyond Coimbatore.
A refugee family with burns on their backs and no possessions left to steal.
A Travancore patrol captain with a dented helmet and a new scar across his cheek.

Then came the first report that mattered, carried by a sepoy whose left arm was wrapped in cloth soaked through with blood.

He had been sent to Udayagiri because the fort had a healer, and because De Lannoy's name still carried weight among the Company's men. They trusted his competence even when they did not trust his loyalty.

The sepoy sat in our shed, jaw clenched, sweat on his lip despite the cool water Lakshmi had insisted I bring for him.

His English was broken, but his Malayalam was fluent, the Malayalam of a man from the coast who had learned Company commands the way he learned any other foreign curse.

"They formed square," he said, and the way he said it made square sound like prayer. "Perfect square. Officers shouting. Drums beating."

I leaned forward. "Where?" I asked.

He shook his head. Place names were less important than images. "On flat ground," he said. "Dry ground. Like a training field."

I could see it.

The sepoy swallowed and continued.

"Cavalry came," he said. "Hyder's horse, many. They tried to break. They could not. We fired. They fell. The horses did not like the bayonet. They turned."

He paused, and his hand trembled slightly against his bandage.

I watched the tremor the way I watched a gun carriage bolt loosen.

It meant something was about to fail.

"Then," he said, and his voice dropped, "the rockets came."

The shed felt colder.

"How many?" I asked.

He stared at me as if I was foolish. "Enough," he said.

He forced himself to keep speaking.

"They screamed," he said. "They came low. They came high. They came in the smoke. One hit the ground outside the square and burst, and iron flew into the legs of men. Another came over the corner and hit inside."

Inside.

That was the key.

"A square cannot open," he said, voice tight. "A square is closed. Men are close. Officers are inside. Drums are inside."

He swallowed hard.

"When it burst inside," he said, "it was like fire entering a hut."

I could see it too clearly.

Men packed shoulder to shoulder. Smoke trapped. Rockets exploding. Iron fragments ricocheting off bayonets and bones.

"The horses came again," the sepoy said. "Not to break the bayonet. Only to push. To press men while rockets fell."

His eyes lifted to mine, and in them I saw shame and fury.

"Men ran," he whispered. "Not because they were cowards. Because their bodies moved."

He clenched his jaw.

"The square broke," he said. "And when a square breaks, everything breaks."

I sat back slowly.

Hendrik, who had been listening in silence, spoke in a controlled voice.

"And the officers?" he asked.

The sepoy's expression went flat. "Some died," he said. "Some rode away. The rest of us carried the wounded until our arms shook."

He looked down at his bandage.

"This," he added, "is a rocket."

---

That night I could not sleep.

I lay beside Lakshmi and listened to the insects outside our shutters, the steady song of a world that did not care about rockets or squares.

Lakshmi's hand rested on my chest, warm and heavy, as if anchoring me to something human.

My mind refused anchoring.

It kept returning to the image of the square.

A thing built out of discipline.

A thing that works.

A thing that becomes a grave when rockets fall.

Near midnight I rose and went to the shed.

The fort was quiet. A sentry's footstep scraped stone. Somewhere a dog barked once and then stopped.

In the shed I spread my range tables and my rough sketches of rocket fragments.

I began to write new instructions.

No tight ranks without cover.
Traverses to break blast.
Loopholes spaced wider.
Gunners trained to aim for the flash of a launch, not the rocket's flight.

Hendrik found me there before dawn, his face grey with fatigue.

He read my notes without speaking.

When he finished, he looked at me.

"This is not how the Company fights," he said.

"The Company is not fighting our war," I replied.

Hendrik's jaw tightened.

"My father built this fort on European doctrine," he said.

"He built it on what worked," I said. "He changed doctrine when it stopped working. That is why he is still alive."

Hendrik stared at the paper as if he wanted to argue with it.

Then, slowly, he nodded.

"We drill," he said.

In the yard, as the sun rose, we drilled.

Not squares.

Not neatness.

Movement. Cover. Discipline that could bend without breaking.

Caspar watched for a while, leaning against the wall, his burned hands wrapped in cloth.

"So," he said, voice dry, "we are learning to run properly now."

Hendrik shot him a look. Caspar grinned.

I did not laugh.

I had seen what rockets did to men who could not run.

The First Mysore War did not send Hyder's banners to our walls.

But it sent us the shape of the war to come.

And in that shape I could already see the outline of our future.

Rockets screaming.
Walls measured by Company men.
Pepper sacks turning into powder.

The jungle changing.
