# Chapter 24: The Last Order

On the first of June, 1777, De Lannoy died the way he lived.

Not with speeches.

With instructions.

---

The messenger came before dawn, knocking hard enough to wake the children.

Lakshmi sat up immediately, eyes alert. She did not ask who it was. She knew. In a soldier's house, knocks before sunrise only mean one thing.

I pulled on my coat and opened the door.

A fort boy stood there, rain dripping from his hair, breath coming fast.

"Sir," he said, and his voice broke on the word. "Captain De Lannoy. He is-"

He could not finish.

I felt a tightness in my chest that had nothing to do with fear.

"I am coming," I said.

Lakshmi was already tying her shawl, movements quick and practised.

"Go," she said to me, voice low. "Do not run. You will fall."

It was the kind of instruction she gave when she loved.

Practical.

I kissed the top of her head without thinking, a rare gesture that surprised us both, and stepped into the dark.

The rain was light, a fine mist that clung to skin. The fort path shone with wet stone.

As I walked, I thought of the first time I had seen De Lannoy at Colachel.

A man who had been my enemy.

A man who had chosen me out of a chain of prisoners.

Learn, and live.

Those words had built my life.

Now the man who had spoken them was dying.

---

De Lannoy's quarters were quiet.

Too quiet.

The fort yard is never quiet, not truly. Even at night there are men snoring, sentries shifting, rats scratching at grain.

This quiet was different.

It was the quiet of people holding their breath.

Margaret met me at the door.

Her face was pale, but her eyes were steady. She looked like a woman who had been preparing for this day for years, and still found herself unready.

"He asked for you," she said in Portuguese, because grief had loosened her careful language.

I nodded and stepped inside.

The room smelled of boiled herbs and lamp smoke. A priest's oil had been burned in one corner, and the sweet heavy scent of it mixed with the fort's constant smell of powder as if two worlds had been forced into the same small space.

De Lannoy lay on a low cot, propped up on pillows.

He looked smaller than he had ever looked in my memory.

Not weak, exactly.

Simply reduced.

His skin had gone waxy. His hands lay on the blanket, the fingers slightly curled as if still holding invisible reins.

Hendrik stood on one side of the cot, posture rigid. Caspar stood on the other side, arms folded, jaw tight, trying to look bored and failing completely.

The priest murmured prayers in Portuguese, low and rhythmic.

De Lannoy's eyes were closed.

His breathing was shallow, controlled, as if he was still trying to discipline his body into obedience.

When I stepped closer, his eyes opened.

They found mine immediately.

Sharp, even now.

"Pieter," he said in Dutch.

The sound of my name in that room hit me harder than any shout in battle.

"Captain," I replied, because habit does not die easily.

De Lannoy's mouth twitched, almost a smile.

"No titles," he said.

It was a small mercy.

He lifted one hand slightly.

I stepped closer and took it.

His grip was weak.

That weakness felt like an insult to the laws of the world.

Men like De Lannoy are not supposed to weaken.

They are supposed to die standing.

He squeezed my fingers once, a small pressure.

Then he spoke, quietly, each sentence measured.

"Listen," he said.

I did.

---

"The magazine," he said.

His voice was thin, but the old clarity was still there.

"Keep it dry," he continued. "No lanterns. No boys showing courage with matches."

Hendrik nodded sharply, as if the instruction was an order he could obey and therefore could bear.

De Lannoy's gaze flicked toward his son.

"Pay the men," he said.

He looked at Kesavadas' clerk standing near the door, as if he knew the clerk would carry these words into the books.

"Pay them on time," he repeated. "A hungry gunner is a traitor waiting."

The priest paused his murmuring for a heartbeat, startled by the bluntness in a deathbed room.

De Lannoy did not care.

He looked at Caspar.

"Do not drink when you are afraid," he said.

Caspar's face tightened. He opened his mouth, then closed it.

De Lannoy's gaze stayed on him.

"Drink when you are happy," he added, and for a moment I heard something in his voice that might have been humour. "It will be rarer."

Caspar's eyes flickered. His jaw worked. He nodded, stiff, as if accepting a command he did not want.

De Lannoy's eyes returned to me.

"You," he said.

The single word carried a weight that made my throat tighten.

"Teach," he said.

That was all.

Teach.

Not command.
Not lead.

Teach.

He had chosen my role and he had never pretended it would be something else.

I nodded, because there was nothing else I could do.

De Lannoy's gaze shifted toward the wall beyond the room, invisible but present in all our minds.

"Do not trust the Company," he said, voice thinning further.

Hendrik stiffened.

The priest's eyes flicked up, wary, as if the word Company was a demon's name.

De Lannoy continued anyway.

"They will smile," he said. "They will measure. They will offer help. They will put their hand on your shoulder and call it friendship."

His eyes found mine again.

"Do not confuse touch with loyalty," he said.

I thought of Hawkins' hand on my arm.

Brother.

The memory made my stomach twist.

De Lannoy's grip on my fingers tightened slightly, then loosened.

His breath hitched.

Margaret leaned in quickly, her hand on his forehead, whispering something in Portuguese that sounded like a prayer and a command at the same time.

De Lannoy swallowed.

"Bury me here," he said.

The priest began to speak again, louder now.

De Lannoy's eyes flicked toward him with irritation.

"Quiet," he rasped, and the priest fell silent, stunned.

De Lannoy looked at Margaret.

"Here," he repeated, softer. "In this soil."

Margaret's eyes filled, but she did not let the tears fall.

"Yes," she whispered.

De Lannoy's gaze moved one last time to his sons.

Hendrik leaned forward, desperate, words trapped behind discipline.

Caspar stood very still, his hands clenched.

De Lannoy did not say I love you.

Men like him do not.

He looked at them as if memorising their faces, then looked back at the ceiling.

His breath came in, thin.

Then it did not come out again.

For a moment, no one moved.

The fort held its breath.

Then Margaret made a small sound, not a cry, more a release, and she pressed her forehead to her husband's hand.

The priest began to murmur prayers again, shaken.

Hendrik stood straighter, as if the death had turned him into stone.

Caspar turned his face away sharply, shoulders trembling once, and then still.

I sat on the edge of the cot and held De Lannoy's hand until it cooled.

Not because I believed it mattered.

Because my body did not know what else to do.

---

When I finally stepped out into the fort yard, the sky was lightening.

Rain fell in fine mist, soft on my face.

The gunners were already moving, lighting sheltered lamps, checking ropes, arguing softly about nothing.

Work does not stop because a great man dies.

That is the cruelty of it.

That is also the mercy.

I stood under the eaves and watched the yard for a long time.

I felt older.

Not because years had passed.

Because the man who had carried part of the weight was gone, and the weight had shifted.

Teach, he had said.

Keep the magazine dry.
Pay the men.
Do not trust the Company.

Simple instructions.

Gun drill for the soul.

I turned toward the gun line and walked.

The day had begun.
