# Chapter 29: The Lines Tested

After Pollilur, men stopped laughing at my covered positions.

They still complained, because soldiers complain the way they breathe, but the tone changed. The complaints became quieter. The jokes became less certain.

When you have heard of a square burning from the inside, you begin to respect ugly precautions.

I drilled the infantry on the Lines not to stand proud, but to disappear.

That was what it felt like to them.

To crouch behind earthwork.
To fire through loopholes.
To move in small groups instead of neat blocks.

"This is not soldiering," one veteran muttered once. "This is rabbit work."

I looked at him and answered with the only truth that mattered.

"Rabbits live," I said. "Neat men die."

They did not like the sentence.

But they remembered Pollilur.

So they crouched.

So they learned.

---

The first serious probe came in the early hours of a grey morning, when the sky was heavy with the promise of rain.

Caspar's outpost sent the signal first.

Three horn blasts, low and urgent, carried along the line.

Then a torch flared on the northern bend, not a labourer's torch but a warning.

Men moved.

Not running in a cluster.

Moving as they had been drilled.

In twos and threes, keeping space, keeping breath, keeping the wall between their bodies and the open ground.

I was at the central battery, the one we had built thicker after De Lannoy's last approval. Two guns sat under rough cover, their barrels already uncovered, their vents checked, their powder charges protected under oilskin.

Hendrik was there too, face set, sword at his hip, his posture rigid as if stiffness could keep fear from entering.

He did not speak much.

He watched.

And that watching told the men everything.

This mattered.

---

The first rockets came before we saw the enemy.

A faint hiss.

Then the scream, rising out of the wet air like an animal in pain.

The rocket arced over the cleared ground and burst in the open space where men would have formed ranks if we had been foolish enough to obey old doctrine.

The explosion threw mud and smoke.

Iron fragments snapped through air.

No one screamed.

Because no one was there.

The second rocket fell closer, skidding in the wet earth, spinning, then bursting against the ditch edge.

Water splashed up, dirty and violent.

Two men behind a loophole flinched, but they did not break.

They had been told to expect it.

Expectation is a kind of armour.

The third rocket screamed overhead and struck a covered position farther down the line.

The cover shuddered.

A man inside yelled once, sharp, then went silent.

So the wall bled.

But it did not burn from the inside the way Raman had described.

That difference mattered.

---

The enemy infantry appeared next, moving in loose lines through the scrub, their cloth dark, their matchlocks held low. They did not rush.

They advanced the way a machine advances.

They fired in volleys that sounded wrong in this wet green place, a European rhythm carried into Indian soil.

Shots struck earthwork and thudded into wood.

One ball found a loophole and hit a young spearman in the mouth.

He went down without a sound, as if his life had been switched off.

I watched his body slump and felt my jaw tighten.

There is no doctrine that stops every death.

There is only doctrine that reduces it.

The Travancore infantry returned fire from the loopholes, scattered, controlled.

No lines.

No flags.

Just men aiming at shapes in scrub.

Then came the cavalry.

Hyder's horsemen burst out of the mist on the left flank, riding hard, shouting. They aimed for the unfinished section where the ditch was shallower.

They had learned our weak points too.

Hendrik's voice snapped across the battery.

"Left. Case shot."

The gun crew moved fast.

I watched the cavalry and felt the old instinct to admire speed and bravery.

Then I remembered Raman burning in a square.

Bravery is cheap.

Survival is not.

---

The rockets kept coming.

Not random now.

Directed.

Teams were launching in sequence, trying to walk the screaming iron across our line, searching for the place where men might cluster, searching for the panic that would create a target.

I heard the pattern.

Launch.
Scream.
Burst.

Launch again, slightly adjusted.

Hyder's men were probing with fire the way a blind man probes with a stick.

Find the soft place.

Break it.

I turned my gaze beyond the mist, searching for the one thing that mattered.

The flash.

Every rocket launch has a moment of truth.

The fuse is touched.

The powder catches.

For a heartbeat the launcher is a bright point in the grey world.

If you are trained, you can see it.

If you are disciplined, you can use it.

"There," I snapped, pointing with my crop.

The gun crew followed my gesture, eyes straining.

A brief flare in the scrub, then another.

Hendrik watched me, his face unreadable.

"Fire," I ordered.

The six-pounder spoke, the recoil slamming back into its muddy platform.

The shot tore into the scrub line where the flash had been.

For a moment I saw bodies jerk and fall.

Then smoke swallowed the detail again.

The rockets faltered.

Not stopped.

But disrupted.

That was enough.

We fired again, aiming at the next flash.

The gun became what it was meant to be.

Not a symbol.

A response.

---

On the left flank, the cavalry reached the ditch.

Horses balked at the drop and the stakes.

Men shouted, whipped, cursed.

Some horses jumped anyway, hooves slipping in wet earth.

Case shot struck them mid-leap.

Horses screamed in a way that makes men remember they are animals too.

Two riders went down into the ditch, bodies twisting, and the ditch water turned dark.

The cavalry wavered.

Then, from the northern bend, I heard a shout that carried through rain and smoke.

Caspar.

His voice was unmistakable, sharp with joy and fury at once.

"Now!" he screamed.

I could not see him, but I could see what happened next.

A small group of Travancore spearmen surged out from a covered sally point near the bend, moving fast and low. They were not many. Twelve, perhaps.

They ran straight toward the scrub where the rocket flashes had been.

It was madness.

It was also exactly what Caspar lived for.

Hendrik's face tightened.

"Recall them," he snapped.

I shook my head.

"Too late," I said.

The spearmen reached the scrub, and for a heartbeat the fight became close, ugly, and personal.

Steel rang.
Men grunted.
A matchlock fired too close and burned someone.

Then one of the rocket screams cut off mid-air.

Another did not launch.

The rocket teams were being hit at the source.

Caspar had done what we could not do with guns alone.

He had put bodies where the enemy thought only fire would go.

The spearmen fell back quickly, dragging one wounded man between them.

They disappeared behind the wall again like a wave pulled back into the sea.

The enemy infantry hesitated.

The cavalry, still tangled at the ditch, began to pull away.

The rockets stopped coming in sequence.

Now they came in desperate uneven bursts, fired too quickly, aimed too poorly.

Fear had entered the rocket crews.

That was the point.

Make the enemy feel what they wanted to make you feel.

---

The attack did not end with a dramatic retreat.

Hyder's men withdrew the way they advanced.

Disciplined.

They pulled back into the scrub, taking what wounded they could, leaving bodies where they fell.

The cavalry disengaged, riders yanking horses away from the ditch, the animals' flanks heaving.

The last rocket screamed overhead and burst in empty ground, furious and pointless.

Then there was only rain again.

And the sound of men breathing.

---

Afterwards, I walked the line with Hendrik.

Mud clung to our boots. The air smelled of powder and wet earth and blood diluted by rain.

We counted the dead.

Not many.

Not few.

Fewer than Pollilur by the order of a thousand.

Hendrik stopped at the covered position that had taken the direct rocket hit.

A gunner sat inside with his arm wrapped, face pale. The rocket fragment had cut deep into muscle, but the man was alive.

Hendrik looked at the cover, the angled wood and packed earth.

His gaze shifted to me.

For a moment I thought he would speak.

Praise would have been easy.

Hendrik did not do easy.

"It worked," he said finally.

It was not praise.

It was acknowledgement.

I nodded.

Farther down the line, Caspar stood with his spearmen, soaked and grinning, blood on his blade, his eyes bright as if he had been fed.

One of his men was wounded, cloth pressed to a thigh, teeth clenched.

Caspar looked at us as we approached.

Hendrik's face went hard.

"You disobeyed," Hendrik said.

Caspar shrugged, careless.

"I won," he replied.

Hendrik's jaw tightened.

Caspar's grin softened by a fraction.

"Your gunner taught me where to aim," he said, and he nodded toward me. "You can fire at flashes. I can stab them."

It was crude.

It was true.

Hendrik stared at him for a long moment.

Then he looked away.

"Next time," Hendrik said, voice flat, "you will tell me before you decide to be a hero."

Caspar laughed once.

"If I have time," he replied.

Hendrik did not laugh.

He kept walking.

I stood for a moment longer, looking north into the wet green world.

The Lines had been tested.

They had held.

But Hyder's men had learned something too.

They had learned where our cover worked.

They had learned we would not give them neat targets.

They would return with a new plan.

War is a conversation.

Each battle is a sentence.

That day, the wall had answered.
