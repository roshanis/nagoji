# Chapter 22: Hendrik's Command

Inheritance is a weight that does not ask whether you are ready.

It drops onto your shoulders because blood has decided it should.

Hendrik had carried that weight since he was a boy. He carried it in the way he stood too straight, in the way he watched his father's face for approval he never quite received. He carried it in his cruelty to himself and his colder cruelty to others.

After the raid on the Lines, the weight became visible.

De Lannoy did not ride north to inspect the damage.

He could not.

Hendrik went instead.

---

The morning after the raid, the ditch stank of wet blood and disturbed earth.

Labourers worked with their faces turned away from the places where bodies had been dragged out. Men dig differently after they have watched someone die in the ditch they are shaping.

The palisade section that had burned was blackened, the wood charred and splintered. Rain had extinguished the flames, but it had not removed the smell. Burned oil clung to the air like a warning.

Hendrik arrived with a small escort and a writing clerk from Kesavadas' office. He dismounted without looking at the muddy ground, as if his boots were immune.

He walked the line with his hands clasped behind his back.

He asked questions in Malayalam, short and precise.

How many men on watch.
Where the lantern had been.
Which sentry had died first.
How quickly the alarm had been raised.

The officers answered with the careful voices of men who knew that one wrong word can end a career.

Hendrik listened without expression.

Then he called the surviving sentry captain forward.

The captain was a thick-necked man with scar tissue on his forearm and a missing ear. He had fought in the old days under Marthanda Varma. He had built his identity on being unbreakable.

Hendrik looked at him as if he were a faulty carriage bolt.

"The raiders reached the ditch before the alarm reached the bastion," Hendrik said.

It was not accusation. It was a measurement.

The captain swallowed. "Rain," he began. "The lantern went out. The men were-"

"The men were tired," Hendrik interrupted. "Yes. They were wet. Yes."

His voice stayed calm.

"Mysore does not stop because our men are tired," he said.

The captain's jaw tightened. "We held," he said.

"We survived," Hendrik corrected. "That is not the same thing."

He turned to the clerk.

"Write this," he said. "Double the night watch. Two lanterns at each post, one covered. No one stands alone. If a lantern goes out, the post calls immediately, even if it is nothing."

The clerk wrote quickly, reed scratching.

Hendrik looked back at the captain.

"And you," he said, "will be whipped."

The captain stared at him, stunned.

Whipping was for boys, for thieves, for men who had no honour. Not for a veteran captain.

The captain's hands clenched.

"For what?" he demanded.

Hendrik's eyes stayed steady.

"For teaching the men that the line can be soft," he said. "Softness spreads."

He gestured to the ditch.

"Do you see those bodies?" he asked.

The captain's gaze flicked toward the place where the raiders had fallen.

"They died because they came too close," Hendrik said. "Our men died because we let them come too close."

The captain's throat worked.

Hendrik's voice stayed even.

"You will be whipped in front of the men," he said. "Not because I enjoy it. Because they must understand the price of delay."

The captain's face flushed with anger and shame.

He opened his mouth again, and then he closed it.

He nodded, once, stiff.

He had understood what Hendrik was doing.

He was not punishing a man.

He was building fear into the line.

Fear is a kind of mortar.

---

I watched the exchange from the edge of the camp, and something in my chest tightened.

I understood Hendrik.

I also disliked him.

De Lannoy had built discipline too. He had used fear. He had whipped men. He had sent boys back to chains.

But De Lannoy's fear was aimed at carelessness, at stupidity, at things that could be corrected.

Hendrik's fear was aimed at the soul.

He wanted men to obey even when there was nothing to correct, only weather and exhaustion and the limits of the body.

He wanted obedience as a form of worship.

That worship could hold a line.

It could also break men.

Caspar watched too, leaning against a post, arms folded, rain dripping from his hair. His face was still, but his eyes were sharp.

When Hendrik walked away, Caspar muttered in Dutch, low enough that only I heard.

"He will whip the rain next," he said.

I did not respond.

Caspar's humour was a shield. It was also a knife he sometimes turned on the wrong people.

Hendrik turned toward me then.

"Your gun fired well," he said.

The words sounded like praise, but his face did not change.

"It held the ditch," I replied.

Hendrik nodded.

"We will place two guns there permanently," he said. "And another on the bend."

I hesitated. "The ground at the bend is still settling," I said. "A gun will sink unless we build a platform first."

Hendrik's gaze held on me.

"Then build a platform," he said.

It was that simple for him.

If the world does not obey, force it.

I felt irritation rise, sharp and childish.

I had spent years learning that the world has limits, that you work with those limits, not against them.

Hendrik had grown up watching his father bend the world. He believed bending was the same thing as breaking.

He looked at me again.

"You will oversee the gun platforms," he said.

Not will you. Not can you.

You will.

I nodded, because refusal was not possible.

Hendrik's gaze flicked toward the labourers, toward the ditch, toward the jungle beyond.

"When my father dies," he said abruptly, in Dutch, "this line will be mine."

The sentence landed without warning.

Caspar's head lifted slightly, as if he had been struck.

I stared at Hendrik.

He continued, voice controlled.

"The court will look at me and see his name," he said. "They will look at you and see a foreign gunner."

There was no malice in it.

Only realism.

It was the kind of realism that feels like a bruise.

"They will need you," Hendrik added. "But they will not follow you."

My throat tightened.

I wanted to argue. I wanted to say men follow competence. Men follow the man who keeps them alive.

But I had lived long enough to know competence is not the only thing men follow.

They follow blood.

They follow legitimacy.

They follow the story they have agreed to believe.

Hendrik looked at me with the cold clarity of a man accepting his role.

"So you will be my right hand," he said. "You will be the bridge. Do not mistake the bridge for the crown."

He turned away and walked toward the next section of the line.

Caspar watched him go, jaw tight.

Then he looked at me.

"Bridge," he said, spitting the word lightly. "How noble."

I did not answer.

I looked out into the rain and felt the truth settle.

I had survived Colachel.

I had been remade in this fort.

I had learned to see what was not yet there.

And still, when power shifted, it would not settle on me.

It would pass over me like a shadow.

That day, as Hendrik's orders snapped through the camp and the whip cracked later in the mud, I understood what my place would be when De Lannoy was gone.

Not commander.

Not heir.

Indispensable.

And invisible.
