# Chapter 25: The Funeral

They buried De Lannoy in the rain.

It felt appropriate.

He had lived most of his life in this wet green land, sweating under armour, arguing with kings, training boys who did not want to be trained. He had built walls that the monsoon tried to erase every year. The rain had been his constant enemy and his constant companion.

So the day they carried his body to the chapel, the sky opened and the water fell as if the world was trying to wash him back into the earth quickly.

---

The chapel filled before dawn.

Candles burned despite the damp, their flames small and stubborn. Wax dripped onto stone. The crucifix above the altar looked darker than usual, as if the carved Christ had absorbed the grief in the room.

De Lannoy's coffin lay in front of the altar, plain wood, no ornament. Margaret had insisted on simplicity. She said he had hated displays. She was right.

A cross rested on the lid.

The Portuguese priest murmured prayers in a voice that shook. He had known De Lannoy for years, not as a penitent, but as a force. Priests are used to men who confess and beg. They are less used to men who order and build.

Margaret knelt by the coffin, her rosary moving through her fingers like a habit that could keep her from breaking.

Hendrik stood behind her, straight as a spear. Caspar stood beside him, arms folded, his face hard in the way men make their faces when they are trying not to feel.

The congregation was larger than it had ever been on an ordinary Sunday.

Parava fishermen.
Latin Catholic traders from the coast.
Travancore officers in cloth darkened by rain.
Gunners from Udayagiri, their hands clean for once, their eyes raw.

And, standing near the chapel door, a court delegation sent by the king.

Raja Kesavadas was there.

He wore plain cloth, no jewellery, and he watched the coffin with the same attention he watched pepper scales. Not cold. Accurate.

There was also a Company man, not in uniform, his coat dark, his face pale. He stood with his hat in his hands and his eyes measuring the room.

Even here, even now, the Company measured.

I stood near the back, close to the wall, as I had stood for years in rooms where I did not fully belong.

The smell of incense mixed with damp cloth and human breath. A low murmur of Portuguese and Malayalam filled the spaces between prayers.

I could not stop thinking of the first time I had smelled De Lannoy's world.

Powder.
Oil.
Discipline.

Now the smell was wax and rain and the end of an era.

---

The priest spoke of salvation.

He spoke of mercy.

He spoke of a man who had served God through service to others.

It was the only way he could make sense of De Lannoy's life in priestly language.

I listened and found my mind drifting toward other memories.

De Lannoy's crop tapping my wrist.
His voice saying, again.
His hand wrapping my burned palm.

Learn, and live.

What do you do when the man who taught you that dies?

You learn anyway.

You live anyway.

The prayers ended.

The priest raised his hand, made the sign of the cross over the coffin, and stepped back.

Margaret stood slowly, her knees stiff.

Hendrik moved forward at once, as if duty had been waiting for an opening.

He placed his hand on the coffin lid.

Not as a son.

As a successor.

I saw eyes in the chapel shift toward him.

The court delegation.
The Company man.
The officers.

They were all watching the same thing.

Who would hold what De Lannoy had built?

Hendrik lifted his chin slightly and met their gaze without flinching.

He was ready for this moment in the way only a man raised under a legend can be ready.

Caspar did not move.

His gaze stayed on the coffin as if refusing to acknowledge the watchers.

I understood him.

Being watched is another kind of capture.

---

When the coffin was carried out, the rain greeted it like an old friend.

Men lifted the wood carefully. The bearers were gunners, not priests. De Lannoy belonged to them more than he belonged to any church.

The procession moved from the chapel toward the small burial ground behind it, where a patch of earth had been cleared and a grave dug deep enough to keep animals out.

Mud clung to feet. Cloth darkened. The world smelled of wet soil.

The Company man followed too, stepping carefully as if afraid the mud might stain his status.

Kesavadas walked with the delegation, head bowed.

Hendrik walked behind the coffin, his face rigid.

Caspar walked beside him, jaw clenched.

Margaret walked last, her shoulders straight, refusing to let the rain make her look like she was weeping.

I walked near the end, and as we passed the fort wall I saw Lakshmi standing under a tree with our children.

She did not come into the chapel. It was not her place, and she knew the world well enough not to force it.

But she had come near.

Willem stood beside her, expression solemn, eyes following the coffin with the strange seriousness children sometimes wear when they sense the world has changed.

Anna held Lakshmi's hand tightly.

Little Thomas looked confused.

Lakshmi met my gaze briefly.

Not sympathy.

Acknowledgement.

This matters.

I nodded and kept walking.

---

At the grave, the priest spoke the final words in Portuguese, voice hoarse.

Then the coffin was lowered.

Ropes creaked.
Wood scraped against earth.

When the coffin settled, the sound was dull, final.

Margaret stepped forward and dropped a handful of soil into the grave.

The soil hit the lid with a soft thud.

Hendrik followed, his hand steady.

Caspar hesitated, then stepped forward and dropped his soil in with a motion that looked almost angry.

Then it was my turn.

I did not know what was expected of me.

I was not Catholic.
I was not family.
I was not local.

I was a man built out of De Lannoy's work.

I stepped forward and let the soil fall through my fingers.

The damp earth clung to my skin.

In that moment, I felt a strange clarity.

This was belonging.

Not a church.

Not a flag.

A grave in the land that had used you and kept you.

---

When the grave was filled and the mound shaped, the crowd began to disperse.

People spoke softly, as if loud voices might wake the dead.

The Company man approached Hendrik with a careful smile.

"Captain De Lannoy was a remarkable man," he said in Portuguese.

Hendrik replied with cold courtesy.

"He served Travancore well," he said.

The Company man nodded, then glanced at me.

"And you," he said, and he switched into English as if enjoying the language, "you were his right hand."

It was not praise.

It was a reminder that the Company had been watching for years.

I bowed slightly.

Kesavadas came to Hendrik next.

He spoke in Malayalam, quiet and precise.

"The king sends his respect," he said. "He also sends his expectation. The wall must hold. The Lines must be finished. The guns must be ready."

Hendrik nodded.

"They will be," he said.

Kesavadas' gaze shifted to me.

For a moment I thought he would speak to me too.

Instead he only nodded, as if acknowledging my existence and my usefulness in the same motion.

Then he turned away.

The handover was happening in small gestures, not declarations.

De Lannoy was being buried.

His work was not.

---

That evening, back at the fort, Hendrik called the gunners into the yard.

The rain had eased. The sky was grey. The walls dripped.

Hendrik stood on the step of the shed where De Lannoy had stood a thousand times.

His voice carried.

"Captain De Lannoy is dead," he said.

There was no softness in the sentence.

The gunners stood still, faces blank, hands clasped.

"His work remains," Hendrik continued. "The king remains. The wall remains. Mysore remains."

He paused.

"So we remain," he said.

He looked over the yard, eyes hard.

"Drill begins at first light," he said. "No excuses. No mourning that delays work. If you want to honour him, load correctly."

The words were harsh.

They were also true in the only language De Lannoy had trusted.

Work.

I stood at the edge of the yard and watched Hendrik take his father's place.

Some men looked relieved to have an order to follow.

Some looked resentful.

Caspar stood apart, expression unreadable, and when Hendrik finished speaking he turned and walked away into the rain without a word.

I went home to Lakshmi and the children and ate rice and fish with hands that still smelled faintly of damp earth.

That night I dreamed of a gun yard full of smoke, and a man with a crop pointing at me out of the haze.

Learn, and live.

The dream did not change.

Only the voice did.
