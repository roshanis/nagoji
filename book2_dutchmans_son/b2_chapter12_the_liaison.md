# Chapter 12: The Liaison

There are many ways to betray a man.

You can do it with a knife, quick and honest.
You can do it with a coin, slow and smiling.
You can do it with a word, which is the easiest way of all, because words can pretend they are harmless even while they kill.

I learned that in Travancore, where my tongue became as useful as my hands.

---

Two days after the English visited Udayagiri, a palace messenger arrived with a palm-leaf note sealed in wax.

It was not addressed to De Lannoy.

It was addressed to me.

The wax seal bore the mark of the Dalawa.

Raja Kesavadas.

De Lannoy read it and handed it back without expression.

"Go," he said in Dutch. "Listen. Then come back and tell me what they really said."

He did not need to explain who they were. In the fort, the word English had started to feel like smoke. Not choking yet, but present in every breath.

I rode south to Padmanabhapuram with a small escort, through lanes shaded by coconut palms and past rice fields that glittered with water. The land looked peaceful. Men were planting. Women were washing cloth on stones. Children ran barefoot, shouting.

Peace is always the first disguise of war.

---

The palace gates swallowed sound.

Outside, the world had been wet and alive. Inside, the air held still, thick with sandalwood and lamp smoke. The stone floors were cool underfoot. Servants moved like shadows, carrying brass trays, speaking in murmurs.

I was led through corridors where carved pillars loomed like dark trees. Painted figures watched from panels, gods and kings and demons frozen mid-gesture.

At the end of the corridor a curtain lifted, and I was shown into a room that was not large but felt heavy with power.

Raja Kesavadas sat on a low seat with a writing board beside him. He was not dressed like a warrior. His cloth was plain, his jewellery minimal. He looked like a man who had stepped out of an account book and learned to breathe.

His eyes were the dangerous part. They did not rest. They assessed.

On one side of the room stood Major Hawkins, the same red coat and polished boots, his smile intact. Behind him hovered his narrow-faced lieutenant and the clerk with ink-stained fingers.

On the other side sat two Travancore ministers, older men with controlled faces, and a Brahmin priest whose forehead marks were as sharp as his stare.

Kesavadas looked at me.

"Pieter," he said in Malayalam, pronouncing my name carefully, as if testing whether it could be shaped into something local.

"Yes, Dalawa," I replied.

He nodded and gestured toward Hawkins.

"You will translate," he said.

It was not a request.

---

Hawkins began with compliments.

He praised the king's wisdom. He praised Travancore's discipline. He praised the walls at Udayagiri and the guns that guarded them.

I translated his words into Malayalam, and while I spoke I watched Kesavadas' face.

Kesavadas did not smile. He listened as if compliments were another kind of measurement.

When Hawkins finished, Kesavadas responded with courtesy that was also a warning.

He welcomed the Company as friends. He thanked them for their concern. He spoke of shared interests in stability and trade.

I translated into English, choosing words that would not make Hawkins bristle.

This was my first lesson of the day.

Translation is not honesty. It is negotiation.

---

Hawkins moved quickly from praise to need.

"Mysore threatens the peace of the coast," he said, voice smooth. "Hyder Ali is a disruptive element. A man who does not understand proper treaties."

Disruptive element.

As if war was a stain on a tablecloth.

I translated into Malayalam. The word disruptive came out as something closer to plague.

The Brahmin priest shifted slightly, displeased, as if he did not want even plague spoken inside a royal room.

Hawkins continued.

"The Company is prepared to support Travancore," he said. "We can offer advice, powder, trained officers. In return, we would ask for certain assurances."

Assurances.

I translated.

Kesavadas nodded. "Assurances," he repeated in Malayalam, tasting the word as if it might be poisoned.

He asked Hawkins, politely, what assurances the Company required.

Hawkins did not hesitate.

"Access," he said. "To ports. To roads. To supply."

His lieutenant leaned forward slightly, as if scenting blood.

"A permanent resident at court would be helpful," Hawkins added. "A man to facilitate communication."

The room stayed still.

The Brahmin priest's eyes sharpened.

I translated the sentence and felt sweat gather at the base of my spine.

A resident at court.

The Company had learned, long ago, that cannons are less effective than clerks.

Kesavadas asked, calm, what a resident would do.

Hawkins smiled.

"Observe," he said. "Advise. Ensure misunderstandings do not occur."

Misunderstandings.

I translated that too, and in Malayalam it sounded like, ensure disobedience does not occur.

Kesavadas leaned back slightly.

His gaze shifted to me, and for a heartbeat I thought he was looking through my skin, weighing not my words but my presence.

Then he turned back to Hawkins.

"Travancore understands friendship," Kesavadas said. "But it does not invite friends to sleep inside its walls."

His Malayalam was polite. The meaning was not.

I translated into English with careful softness.

"We welcome cooperation," I said, "but the court does not permit foreign residences within the palace precincts."

Hawkins' smile tightened.

"Of course," he said. "Not within the palace. That would be improper. Perhaps in Padmanabhapuram town. A small office. A few clerks."

Small.
Few.

Words that were meant to sound harmless.

I translated, and Kesavadas' expression did not change.

He asked, still calmly, how many clerks were few.

Hawkins laughed lightly. "As many as necessary."

I did not translate the laugh. I translated the words.

Kesavadas nodded as if he had received an honest answer.

---

For two hours we moved through sentences that were traps.

The Company asked for rights that sounded like conveniences.
Travancore offered courtesies that were really boundaries.
Hawkins spoke of mutual benefit. Kesavadas spoke of mutual respect.

In between them I stood, turning poison into perfume, turning threats into polite requests, turning refusals into regretful apologies.

At one point Hawkins said, in English, "Surely the Dalawa understands that the Company cannot commit resources without guarantees."

Guarantees.

The word had the weight of a cannonball.

I translated it as assurances again, because guarantees would have sounded like a rope tightening.

Hawkins glanced at me, quick and sharp. He had noticed.

His voice stayed pleasant.

"Mr van der Berg," he said, "you are very good at your work."

I bowed slightly. "Thank you, Major."

His eyes held mine.

"Do you understand what is being discussed?" he asked.

It was a question meant for the room, but it was aimed at me like a musket.

I answered in English, evenly. "Yes."

Hawkins nodded, satisfied, and turned back to Kesavadas as if I had just confirmed his suspicion.

Kesavadas watched that exchange without moving.

Then, calmly, he ended the meeting.

He spoke of consulting the king. He spoke of prayer and deliberation. He thanked the Company for its concern and promised a formal response.

Hawkins bowed. The lieutenant bowed. The clerk bowed.

Courtesy, like soldiers stacking arms.

---

When the English left the room, Kesavadas did not dismiss me.

He dismissed the ministers and the priest first.

Only when the room was empty of everyone but him and me did he speak again.

This time he did not use Portuguese. He did not use the polished Malayalam of court.

He spoke in the plain Malayalam of a man who had grown up among soldiers and merchants.

"They want a resident," he said. "They want eyes inside our house."

I nodded. It felt safer than speaking.

Kesavadas watched me for a long moment.

"They called you brother," he said, as if he were stating an established fact.

Heat rose in my face. I forced myself to meet his gaze.

"They call many things brother," I said. "They call pepper brother when they want it cheap."

Kesavadas' mouth twitched, the smallest possible smile, gone almost as soon as it appeared.

He leaned forward slightly.

"Tell me something, Pieter," he said.

His voice stayed calm, but the room felt suddenly tighter.

"When they stop asking," he said, "and start taking, where will you stand?"

The question did not belong to language. It belonged to blood.

I thought of my children. Willem's questions. Anna's sharp eyes. Little Thomas asleep with his mouth open, trusting the world because he had not yet seen what it does to men.

I thought of Lakshmi telling me to become a thing that bites.

I thought of De Lannoy, a man who had crossed from enemy to architect and paid for it in loneliness.

I took a breath and answered slowly, because a quick answer would have been a lie.

"I will stand where my life is," I said. "Here. On your wall. In my house. Between my children and any man who thinks he can take them."

Kesavadas' gaze held on me.

"That is not a neat answer," he said.

"No," I agreed.

He sat back.

"Neat answers are for men who have never been conquered," he said. "Or men who are planning to conquer."

He picked up his writing board and tapped it once, thoughtful.

"The Company will not disappear," he continued. "Hyder will not disappear. We must choose the order in which we are bitten."

He looked at me again, eyes hard now.

"You will translate for them again," he said.

My throat tightened.

It was not an honour. It was a chain, forged out of usefulness.

"Yes, Dalawa," I said.

Kesavadas nodded, satisfied.

"Remember this," he said. "You are not only translating words. You are translating intentions. If you soften too much, we become fools. If you sharpen too much, we become enemies."

He paused, then added, almost casually, "And if you ever decide you belong to them, tell me first."

The threat was not in the words. It was in the calmness.

I bowed.

When I left the room, my back was damp with sweat.

In the corridor, the painted gods watched me pass.

I realised, with a chill that had nothing to do with the palace's cool stone, that I had been given a role that could not be refused.

I had been captured once with ropes.

Now I was being held with work.
