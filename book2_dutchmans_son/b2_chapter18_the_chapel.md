# Chapter 18: The Chapel

The chapel at Udayagiri was smaller than a powder magazine and more dangerous in its own way.

Powder can kill you quickly.

Faith can kill you slowly, by teaching you who to hate and then making you proud of it.

De Lannoy built that chapel with his own money after Kalakad.

His son Joannes had been killed there on the fourteenth of September, 1765, a young officer not yet hardened enough to believe he could die. The men of the fort called the boy *Cheriya Kappittan*, the Small Captain. De Lannoy never used the nickname. He only said his son's name once, as if saying it twice might summon the same messenger again.

When I was a boy in Batavia, my mother taught me to bow my head in a Lutheran church and keep it up everywhere else. She taught me to distrust Catholics the way you distrust stagnant water.

"They smile," she used to say. "And then they take."

I learned those lessons early.

I carried them to Ceylon.

I carried them to Colachel.

I carried them into Travancore, and I did not understand at first that a man can live in a Hindu king's service and still carry old European hatreds like a relic in his pocket.

De Lannoy went to the chapel on Sundays when his joints allowed it.

He did not announce it. He did not make a show. He simply left the fort yard after morning drill and walked toward the small stone building near the outer wall, where a wooden cross rose above the roofline like a spear.

His wife Margaret went too, of course, her shawl pulled over her hair, a rosary hidden in her palm.

Sometimes Hendrik went, dutiful, as if faith was another kind of discipline.

Caspar rarely went. He said God was too polite in chapels. He preferred gods who lived in storms.

That morning, after De Lannoy's leg had trembled again and he had retreated to the shed, Margaret came to my house.

Lakshmi answered the door, eyes calm.

Margaret greeted her with the careful warmth of a woman who has learned to navigate other women's worlds. Lakshmi replied with equal care. They had never been friends. They had never been enemies. They shared one thing, and it was enough.

Men who belonged to no one else.

"Pieter," Margaret said, and her Portuguese accent softened my name the way the air softens stone, "will you come with him today?"

I hesitated.

Lakshmi's gaze held on me, unreadable.

Margaret's face stayed composed, but there was something in her eyes that made refusal feel like cruelty.

"He will listen to you," she added quietly. "Sometimes he listens to you when he will not listen to me."

That was not true.

It was simply the way Margaret asked for help without sounding like she needed it.

I nodded.

---

The chapel smelled of wax and damp stone.

Candles burned in front of a small painted image of Mary, her face pale and gentle, her eyes lowered as if she did not want to see what men had done in her name. A wooden crucifix hung above the altar. The carved Christ looked thinner than any man who had ever carried a musket.

The priest was Portuguese, old, his hair grey and his hands stained with ink. He spoke in a mixture of Portuguese and Malayalam, because language here was always a negotiation.

The congregation was small.

A few Parava fishermen.
Two soldiers who crossed themselves quickly, as if embarrassed.
Margaret and her children.
De Lannoy, standing stiffly near the front, his face expressionless.

And me, at the back, feeling like an intruder in a room that was supposed to be mine by birth.

As the priest began the prayers, I watched De Lannoy.

He moved with practised familiarity. He knelt slowly, careful of his knee. He made the sign of the cross without flourish. His lips moved in words I had been taught to mistrust.

There was no performance in him.

Only habit.

Habit is a kind of truth.

The priest spoke of loyalty. Of suffering. Of kings and taxes and the temptation to believe that God lived in the house of the powerful.

He did not speak of Marthanda Varma.

He did not speak of Hyder Ali.

He spoke as if the chapel existed outside history.

I knew better.

In a kingdom like this, even a prayer is political.

---

After the mass, Margaret went to speak with the priest. Hendrik stepped outside and stood in the sunlight as if needing to prove he was not trapped by stone walls and incense.

De Lannoy stayed kneeling.

The candles flickered in the humid air. A lizard moved along the wall, quick and silent.

I waited.

When De Lannoy finally rose, he did it slowly, hand braced on the pew. His breath caught for a moment and then steadied.

He turned and saw me.

His eyebrows rose slightly.

"You came," he said in Dutch, as if confirming it for himself.

"Margaret asked," I replied.

De Lannoy glanced toward his wife, then back at me.

"She worries too much," he said.

He stepped outside into the light and paused, letting the sun warm his face. The fort wall rose beyond the chapel, stone and iron, the kingdom's real prayer.

We stood in silence for a while.

Then, because silence in a chapel courtyard feels like something you must fill, I spoke.

"You never converted," I said.

The words sounded blunt, almost rude.

De Lannoy's gaze stayed on the wall.

"No," he said simply.

"Some men expected you to," I continued. "The Dutch. The Brahmins. Even the Company men."

De Lannoy's mouth tightened.

"They expect many things," he said.

I swallowed and forced myself to ask what I had been circling for years.

"Why did you not?" I asked. "Why stay Catholic when no one wants you as Catholic?"

De Lannoy looked at me then, and there was a flicker of something in his eyes.

Amusement, perhaps.

Or pity.

"Because it is true," he said.

The answer was so simple it made my chest tighten.

"True?" I repeated.

De Lannoy nodded.

"I was raised Catholic," he said. "I prayed as a boy. I sinned as a man. I will die as a Catholic. Changing the words does not change the work."

He gestured toward the fort.

"I serve a Hindu king," he continued. "That is my work. It does not require me to pretend his god is mine."

He looked back toward the chapel door where Margaret stood, still speaking with the priest.

"My wife would not have married a man who lied about his faith," he added quietly. "And I did not build this life by lying."

The last sentence surprised me more than it should have.

De Lannoy had lied, of course. Every soldier lies. He had lied to the Dutch when it suited him. He had lied to enemies. He had lied with silence.

But perhaps he meant a different kind of lie.

The lie that turns a man into a mask.

---

I thought of myself then.

Lutheran by birth.

Husband to a Hindu woman.

Father to children with Christian names who bowed to temple lamps because it pleased their mother and because the world was safer when you respected the gods of the land you lived on.

I had not prayed in a Lutheran church in years. When I did pray, it was not Lutheran or Catholic or Hindu. It was the wordless prayer of a man measuring powder by lamplight and hoping his hands would not slip.

Where did that leave me?

"What is belonging?" I asked him before I could stop myself.

De Lannoy looked at me with the tired patience he reserved for questions that had no clean answer.

"Belonging is work done well," he said.

I frowned. "Only work?"

He shook his head slightly.

"Work is what remains when everything else changes," he said. "Faith can change. Names can change. Kings die. Companies rot."

He tapped the stone wall with his knuckles.

"But a fort still needs men who will stand on it," he said.

He paused, and his voice softened by a fraction.

"And it needs someone to bury you when you fall," he added. "That is belonging too."

I looked at him, and for a moment I saw not the foreign captain but the man who had been swallowed by this land and decided, stubbornly, to stay in its stomach.

"Will they bury you as a Catholic?" I asked.

De Lannoy's mouth tightened.

"The Dutch will not," he said. "The Brahmins will not. The Portuguese priest will, because Margaret will make him. The king will allow it, because the king understands debts."

He looked toward the fort again.

"And the soil will not care," he finished.

That was the most honest thing he had said all morning.

---

On the walk back to the fort, Margaret fell into step beside me.

Her rosary clicked softly in her hand.

"Thank you," she said.

I shook my head. "I did nothing," I replied.

Margaret gave a small tired smile.

"You stood near him," she said. "That is not nothing."

Ahead of us, De Lannoy walked slowly, his limp controlled, his shoulders still straight.

Hendrik walked on his other side, guarding him with duty.

Caspar was not there. Caspar never came when the room was quiet and full of God.

At the fort gate, a sentry saluted, eyes flicking to De Lannoy, then away. Respect. Fear. Habit.

De Lannoy stepped through the gate and the yard noise swallowed him again.

Guns being cleaned.
Men shouting.
Wheels creaking.

Work.

As I watched him disappear into his own creation, I realised something that unsettled me.

For years I had thought belonging was a place you could arrive at.

Perhaps it was only a set of duties you could not escape.
