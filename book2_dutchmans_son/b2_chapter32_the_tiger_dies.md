# Chapter 32: The Tiger Dies

Men had begun calling Hyder Ali the Tiger long before he died.

It was not a title he chose.

It was a name the world gave him because it needed a shape for its fear.

Tigers move unseen until they do not.

They kill without apology.

They make villages go quiet.

Hyder had done that to kingdoms.

So when the news came in 1782 that the Tiger was dead, men in Travancore reacted the way men always react when a predator falls.

They cheered.

They laughed.

They breathed as if the air had become lighter.

The relief lasted one breath.

---

The courier arrived at Udayagiri at dusk, his horse lame, his own face drawn.

He carried a dispatch from Padmanabhapuram, sealed with the Dalawa's mark.

Hendrik took it, broke it open, and read.

His eyebrows lifted slightly.

That was all.

Then he looked at me and held the paper out.

The message was brief.

Hyder Ali dead.
Illness.
Mysore leadership uncertain.
Stay alert.

I read it twice, as if reading twice could produce a different meaning.

Caspar was in the yard, just returned from the Lines, mud on his boots, eyes bright.

"What is it?" he demanded.

Hendrik said it aloud.

Hyder Ali is dead.

The words moved through the fort like wind.

Gunners shouted.
Spearmen grinned.
Men slapped each other's backs.

Even the refugees outside the wall heard and began to murmur, the sound rising into something like prayer.

Death, for a moment, felt like hope.

Caspar laughed, a full sound.

"Finally," he said. "Finally the beast bleeds."

Hendrik did not smile.

He looked at the paper again as if trying to see what was not written.

I felt something cold in my chest.

Not because I mourned Hyder.

Because I had learned, the hard way, that men who build systems do not die with their bodies.

Their systems remain.

---

That night, Hendrik called the officers into the shed.

He spoke of patrols.
He spoke of watch rotations.
He spoke of supplies.

He refused to let celebration loosen discipline.

Some men resented it. Some obeyed.

Caspar stood by the door, arms folded, bored again now that the moment of excitement had passed.

"You are afraid of joy," Caspar muttered to me in Dutch.

"I am afraid of tomorrow," I replied.

Caspar snorted.

"Tomorrow is always coming," he said. "We cannot fight it."

He turned away as if the conversation had finished.

I looked at Hendrik as he spoke, and for a moment I saw De Lannoy in him.

Not the warmth.

The stubborn refusal to let emotion become weakness.

When the meeting ended, Hendrik dismissed the officers and kept me back.

He waited until the shed was empty, then spoke in a low voice.

"Tipu," he said.

The name was not in the dispatch.

It did not need to be.

Hyder's son had already been a presence in our minds, a shadow behind the Tiger.

I nodded slowly.

"He was at Pollilur," I said.

Hendrik's jaw tightened.

"Yes," he replied.

We stood in silence, both seeing the same image.

Raman's burned face.
The square becoming fire.
Rockets in the sky.

Tipu had not been a rumour in that battle.

He had been the hand lighting the fuse.

"Hyder was a soldier," I said quietly. "He wanted power."

Hendrik looked at me.

"And Tipu?" he asked.

I hesitated.

It is dangerous to speak certainty about a man you have not met.

But I had read reports. I had heard stories. I had listened to refugees who spoke of Mysore with the particular fear reserved for zeal.

"Tipu wants more than power," I said. "He wants a world remade."

Hendrik's face stayed still.

"Then the Tiger is not dead," he said.

He looked toward the wall.

"It has only changed its skin."

---

Later, when the fort quieted and the last shouts of celebration faded, I climbed the parapet alone.

The sky was clear for once, the stars sharp. The jungle beyond the Lines was a black mass.

Somewhere inside it, beyond sight, Mysore's camps would still burn with cooking fires. Men would still drill. Rocket tubes would still be cleaned and packed. Officers would still shout orders.

News of Hyder's death would reach them too.

They would mourn, perhaps.

Or they would not.

Machines do not mourn.

They adjust.

Below me, in the fort yard, a gunner laughed softly in his sleep, dreaming of peace.

I thought of Lakshmi and the children, safe behind walls that existed only because men kept working.

I thought of De Lannoy in the ground behind the chapel, his last instructions still fresh in my mind.

Keep the magazine dry.
Pay the men.
Do not trust the Company.

Simple.

And still not enough.

I stood on the wall and looked north.

For a moment I let myself feel the relief the others had felt.

Hyder dead.

Then I exhaled, and the relief vanished.

Because relief is a luxury.

And Tipu was alive.
