# Epilogue: The Torch Passes

I write this in my late fifties with hands that are not as steady as they were.

Age does not announce itself with one dramatic failure. It arrives as small betrayals. A finger that cramps while holding a pen. An eye that waters when lamp smoke drifts wrong. A breath that comes shorter after climbing the wall steps.

I used to believe only bodies aged.

Now I know ideas age too.

The idea that European drill is invincible.
The idea that walls are permanent.
The idea that a Company can be satisfied with profit.

Hyder Ali is dead, and men tell themselves the war has ended.

I have learned not to trust men when they comfort themselves.

Tipu is alive.

The Lines are unfinished.

The Company smiles.

And the world keeps changing whether we ask it to or not.

When I began to write, I thought I was writing for myself.

A man puts words on paper because he wants to hold something steady while everything around him moves.

But the longer I write, the more I understand I am writing for people I will never meet.

For my son, Willem, who will inherit my face and my accent and my failure to belong cleanly anywhere.

For my daughter, Anna, who will marry into a family that will look at her and see questions.

For my youngest, Thomas, who still believes walls exist because they are meant to.

And perhaps for men not of my blood at all.

Men who will come after.

Men who will carry the work and the cost.

Travancore has always taken outsiders and used them.

Sometimes it remakes them.

Sometimes it breaks them.

Years ago, a report crossed my desk in Udayagiri.

It was a small thing, almost an aside in a dispatch about troop movements and supply routes.

An old cavalry commander in the south, Ananthan Pillai, had taken in a Maratha fugitive.

The name Ananthan Pillai meant little to most men in the fort. But I knew the story, because De Lannoy had told it to me once.

Ananthan Pillai had been born Nagoji Sawant.

A Maratha. A prisoner from the old wars. A man who had been captured and should have died, but who had been remade instead. He had married a local woman, taken a new name, served kings who were not his by birth.

He was what Travancore made of men it chose to keep.

The report said the man had a brand on his forehead.

Not a decorative mark.

A punishment burned into flesh.

The words on the brand were clear enough that even a foreign gunner like me could understand their weight.

Brahmin-killer.

Temple robber.

Murderer.

The report said the fugitive worked in stables at first.

The report said Ananthan's wife insisted on keeping him, against counsel, against prudence, against every rule that makes a kingdom feel safe.

I read the paragraph twice and then set the paper down.

Travancore swallowing another outsider.

Travancore making another enemy into a tool.

Travancore, endlessly hungry for men who can be used.

I did not think of it again for years.

Then, not long ago, a dispatch from the northern marches mentioned the name again.

Bhalerao.

The branded one.

Not a stable hand any longer.

Not a fugitive.

A man on horseback with blood on his hands and purpose in his eyes, if the messenger's words were true.

I held the paper in my hands and felt a strange sensation I did not have a word for.

Not hope.

Not fear.

Recognition.

Travancore was doing what it had always done.

Taking wreckage and asking it to become a wall.

---

When I was sixteen, I was taken at Colachel and thought my life had ended.

Then De Lannoy pointed at me and said, learn, and live.

He did not offer comfort.

He offered work.

Work made me into something else.

Not Dutch.
Not Travancorean.

A gunner.

Perhaps it will make Bhalerao into something else too.

Not forgiven.
Not absolved.

But useful.

Sometimes usefulness is the only redemption a kingdom can offer.

I do not know what kind of man Bhalerao will become.

I do not know whether he will survive Tipu.

I know only that the wall needs men, and men are always arriving, broken in different ways, carrying different ghosts.

---

I will not live to see the end of this story.

I have accepted that.

A man does what he can in the time he is given. He maintains walls. He trains gunners. He keeps faith with the memory of those who taught him.

Then he passes the work to whoever comes next.

Travancore takes what it needs.

It took De Lannoy, who came as a conqueror and died as a builder.

It took Nagoji Sawant, who came as a prisoner and became a legend.

It took me, who came as a boy full of Lutheran hate and became a man who no longer knows how to pray but still knows how to aim.

Perhaps it will take Bhalerao too.

The wheel turns.

The story goes on.

One outsider to another.

One transformation to another.

I am writing this because someone should. Because the work does not stop when the worker dies. Because a wall is not built by one man or one generation but by all the hands that touch the stone.

The torch passes.

Not in ceremony.

In necessity.

And somewhere in the south, a young man with a brand on his forehead is learning what I learned forty years ago.

That survival is not forgiveness.

That work is not redemption.

But that both are better than the alternative.

Travancore endures.

The rest is detail.
