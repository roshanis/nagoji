# Chapter 26: Fire in the Pepper Fields

The fire started as a thin, uncertain line on the horizon.

At first it looked like nothing more than the usual dry season burn, a farmer clearing undergrowth, a careless coal from a cook fire. We had seen such smudges before along the marches and near the coast.

Then the line thickened. Broke. Reappeared in two places at once.

By the time the first runner reached the fort, sweat slick on his chest, the air already held the faint, bitter tang of something more than scrub.

“Raiders,” he panted. “From the west and the north. Some with Dutch guns. Some with old house banners. They strike near Padmini Amma's upper fields.”

Two fronts.

Exactly what Ramayyan had feared.

“The timing,” he said later, in the war hall, fingers pinching the bridge of his nose, “is not an accident. Someone has been counting our drills as carefully as we count their gossip.”

One column of raiders had come along the coast, hitting small fishing villages and storehouses, testing our new outposts, then fading when confronted with cannon. The other slipped down through the northern hills, men from Kollamkara's line and a few of his sulking neighbours, now emboldened by whispers of Dutch backing and Maratha distraction.

They had chosen their meeting point well.

A stretch of land where pepper grew thick on both sides of a narrow path, the vines climbing their rough bark supports in dense walls of green. Canals ran nearby, feeding the plants and providing easy movement for boats. A few small shrines dotted the ridges, stone and carved wood almost swallowed by foliage.

Padmini's land.

She was in the fort when the news came, having come to argue over grain rates and levy schedules.

Her stick stopped tapping when she heard the runner's words.

“They chose my fields,” she said. “Of course they did. Old men fight their wars in land they have never walked; young ones set torches where women count vines.”

Marthanda Varma's jaw tightened.

“We cannot let them hold that strip,” he said. “If they do, they have a knife at our throat. They can move along the canal, slip between our northern and coastal forts, vanish into house land whenever we chase.”

I saw the problem as soon as I pictured the map.

“Our horse cannot move at speed through those vines,” I said. “The path is too narrow. The supports too close. The canal banks too soft.”

“Foot,” Ramayyan said.

“Foot will bleed in every bush,” I said. “Every stand of pepper is cover. Every tree hides a musket. We will lose men in inches.”

“You have an alternative?” the king asked.

The answer came before I wanted it to.

“Burn it,” I said.

The word hung in the air like smoke.

Padmini's head snapped toward me.

“Burn it?” she repeated, very softly.

“Not all,” I said quickly. “A strip. Narrow. Enough to deprive them of cover along the canal. We can drive them out of that corridor. Without that, they must choose: retreat into the open where our horse can run or stay and be flanked in smaller patches.”

“You speak of my vines as if they were scrub,” she said.

“Today, to them, they are a shield,” I said. “Tomorrow, if they live, they are coin. I know what I am asking.”

Her knuckles tightened on her stick.

“You know,” she said. “You do not feel.”

Marthanda Varma looked between us.

“If we do nothing,” he said quietly, “they will move along that corridor until they reach places where our walls are thin and our men few. They will hit us where we cannot easily answer. They will write their own terms in our fields.”

“If we burn,” Padmini said, “you carve a wound through my land that will take years to heal. Pepper is not rice. It does not spring back in one season. You cut into my children and their children.”

Ramayyan's stylus lay still on the leaf before him.

“Amma,” he said, “if we let them keep that corridor, they carve different wounds. Through forts. Through houses. Through your own name when they brag of having used your land to break the king.”

She closed her eyes for a heartbeat.

When she opened them, they were wet and furious.

“Do it,” she said. “But do not pretend you did it to me without my consent. Let every man who walks that blackened line in years to come know that I allowed it, and that I remember every step you take on it.”

I nodded, throat tight.

“I will ride there myself,” I said. “I will not ask another to light the first torch.”

The ride to her upper fields was short and long at once.

Short in distance. Long in what it stretched inside me.

Smoke thickened as we approached.

Not the high, pale smoke of distant scrap fires, but dark, greasy columns that tasted of resin and sap. Sparks floated in the air, landing on skin and cloth, stinging.

We reined in on a ridge that overlooked the disputed strip.

The sight below made my stomach knot.

Pepper vines climbed in dense, ordered lines along both sides of the canal, their leaves thick, their fruit clusters hanging like green beads. Between them, the narrow path ran like a vein. In that vein, raiders moved, their bodies half hidden by foliage, muskets glinting between leaves.

Shots cracked from the shadows.

Along the canal, we could see the shapes of boats, low and loaded, ready to slip into any gap.

"If we hit them from here," Ponnan said, "we expose ourselves. They have too many places to hide."

“We do not hit them here,” I said. “We hit their shield.”

I dismounted.

The ground underfoot was dry, the leaf litter crisp. The air shimmered with heat from fires already licking at the far edges, where some careless torch had caught more than intended.

I took a torch from one of the men, its head wrapped in oil soaked cloth, flame steady despite the breeze.

For a moment, I simply stood, feeling the weight of it.

Padmini's face flashed in my mind. Her stick. Her eyes.

Revathi's words came too.

You will always choose the king first, she had said. The houses later.

I stepped to the line where the first row of vines began.

I set the torch to the dried leaves and bark at the base of the support post.

For a heartbeat, nothing happened.

Then the flame caught.

It crawled up the post, licking at the lower leaves. The sap in the stem hissed, resisting. The fire flared brighter, driven by the oiliness of the plant.

I moved along the line, men spreading out on either side of me, setting similar points.

A controlled burn, as much as such a thing can be in war.

We lit a zig zag path, not a solid wall, leaving gaps where men could move, where new growth might find purchase in years to come. Enough, I hoped, to deny full cover without turning the land into a charcoal scar with no hope.

The fire responded with its own logic.

It leapt where we had not intended, skipped over some of our careful lines to catch on a fallen branch we had missed. Smoke boiled up, thicker, hotter. The raiders below shouted, caught between the sudden blaze and the patrols we had already sent to block their retreat into open ground.

Some tried to push through the unburned rows, hoping the vines would protect them from our shots.

We waited until the smoke half obscured their movement, then fired into the gaps we had created, where silhouettes showed clearer against flame.

This was a cruel way to fight.

Men coughed and choked, eyes streaming, stumbling out of the burning strip only to meet our blades. Others, more lucky or more desperate, threw themselves into the canal, water hissing as embers fell around them.

I do not pretend there was honour in that moment.

It was ugly and hot and filled with the sounds of men and plants dying together.

Some of our own fell too, caught by stray shots or sucked into the flames when the wind shifted. We pulled who we could back. We lost others in the smoke.

By late afternoon, the corridor no longer existed.

In its place lay a blackened stretch of ground, posts charred and fallen, vines gone, earth scorched. Beyond it, patches of green pepper still stood, untouched, their leaves fluttering in a hot breeze that smelled of ash.

The raiders had scattered.

Some bodies lay in the burned strip, blackened beyond recognition. Others floated in the canal. A few survivors limped away into neighbouring land, coughing, their clothes singed, their pride burned worse than their skin.

We did not pursue far.

The fire had done its work.

That night, back at the fort, the smell of smoke clung to everything. Even the water tasted faintly of it.

Padmini arrived late, having ridden to her fields as soon as we sent word that the immediate danger had passed.

She walked into the hall without ceremony, soot streaks on her sari, hair plastered to her temples with sweat.

Every conversation stuttered and stopped.

She stood in the centre of the room and looked at me.

“You did what you said you would,” she said. “You burned a strip. Not all. Enough.”

Her voice was flat.

“I rode there,” she went on. “I walked the black line. It runs like a mark across my land. For years, men will ask what happened there. I will tell them. They will ask why. I will tell them that too.”

“We stopped them,” I said. “They will not use your vines as cover again.”

“When the raiders burned your lower fields years ago, you called it an act of cowardice,” I said, the memory of that first campaign rising unbidden. “Today, I did it with a torch in my own hand. I do not know which ash is heavier.”

She looked at me, her eyes hard and unblinking.

"They burned to destroy," she said. "You burned to save. But ash tastes the same in my mouth, Ananthan. Do not expect me to distinguish the flavour."

“My vines,” she continued, her voice dropping. “The king's vines. The Dutch's desired vines. Your fuel. Many names for the same plants.”

She took a breath.

“I do not say you were wrong,” she said. “If I thought there had been another way, I would be screaming now, not speaking. But do not expect me to thank you. There are wounds that are necessary and wounds that are kind. This was the first, not the second.”

Marthanda Varma watched from his platform, face unreadable.

“You have my word,” he said quietly, “that the state will help replant, will support your house through the years it takes for those vines to bear fruit again.”

“Your word does not make plants grow faster,” she said. “But perhaps it will keep some of my boys from having to sell their swords to men like Kollamkara when the hunger comes.”

She turned to leave, then paused.

"You have chosen your side firmly now, Pillai," she said without looking back at me. "When Dutch, Mysore or your own hills come in force, you will be in front of the king's fort. You will not be standing on my verandah. I will remember that."

Her footsteps echoed as she walked out.

Revathi's anger arrived later, as I had known it would.

She did not waste it on public scenes.

Instead, she came to the fort wall where I stood a few evenings later, watching the blackened strip in the distance, still visible as a dark line even from here.

“You carved your own mark into this land,” she said, without greeting.

“We carved it together,” I said. “The king, Ramayyan, Padmini. I merely held the first torch.”

“Men like you always say that,” she replied. “You hide behind councils and shared decisions when the fire is yours.”

She leaned on the parapet, staring north.

“Do you remember when you first came to Velinadu,” she asked, “how you spoke of fighting Europeans, of keeping this land free from their flags?”

“I do,” I said.

“Today, for a moment, you were the one using fire on fields to force men to move,” she said. “If a Dutchman had done what you did, you would have called him monster. Because you did it for a king you respect, you call it necessity.”

“You think there was another choice?” I asked.

She was silent for a long time.

“No,” she said finally. “That is what angers me most. Sometimes, the only choices left are between a slow death and a quick burn. You chose well for the kingdom. Badly for the house. As I knew you would.”

She straightened.

“This does not make you evil,” she said. “It makes you dangerous. To love you, as I do, is to love a man whose first instinct is to save the larger pattern, not the smaller square.”

Her gaze flicked toward the blackened strip.

“You once asked only for a corner of my house and a sliver of my heart,” she said. “Today you carved a wound across my land instead.”

The words landed heavier than any accusation.

“You knew that before we stood before the goddess,” I said quietly.

“Of course,” she said. “I married you with my eyes open. I knew there would be days when you stood on the wall beside the king instead of on my verandah. I did not expect to like it when those days came.”

She moved away from the wall, then turned back.

“We will work together when it suits the land,” she said. “We will stand in the same halls. We will speak the same anger at the same foreigners. We will share this house in name and in law. But do not ask me to pretend this scar is not also your work.”

She walked away, her back straight.

The blackened strip in the distance did not care about our hearts.

It sat there, a dark vein, waiting for green to creep back over it in its own time.

As the sun set, its last light turned the scorched posts into jagged silhouettes.

The fire in the pepper fields had done more than deny cover to raiders.

It had burned away the illusion that love could soften the choices ahead.

In its place, another truth rose, harder edged.

Later, when Ramayyan sifted rumours, Ibrahim Marakkar's name floated more than once to the surface, tied to bales of cloth and quiet conversations on canal banks. Whether he had helped Kollamkara reach Dutch guns or had nudged those same whispers toward the fort first was never entirely clear.

I asked Ramayyan about it once, months after the ash had cooled.

He did not look up from his ledger.

“Some men are most useful when both sides believe they are theirs,” he said. “Ibrahim has traded on this coast longer than you have been alive. He will trade here after we are both dust. Do not trouble yourself with his accounts. I keep them for him.”

“And if he betrayed us?”

“Then I would know,” Ramayyan said. “And he would know that I know. That is usually enough.”

He turned a page, stylus already moving to the next line.

Men like Ibrahim rarely walked in straight lines. Perhaps that was the only way to survive on a coast where every power wanted the same pepper.
