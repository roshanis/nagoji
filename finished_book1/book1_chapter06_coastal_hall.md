# Chapter 6: The Coastal Hall

They did not take me to a palace.

In the Deccan, kings and sardars received men in high halls thick with incense, with carpets to muffle footsteps and paintings on the walls to remind visitors who held power. Here, on this coast, the hall where my fate shifted stood within sight of the sea.

We travelled south along a road that clung to the edge of the land. On one side, palm groves and pepper gardens climbed gentle slopes. On the other, low cliffs dropped toward a strip of sand and the grey plane of the ocean beyond. The air carried a constant tang of salt and something metallic, as if the very wind had tasted blood.

The bulls were gone. This time I rode, though not as I had once ridden.

The horse beneath me was a coastal animal, smaller than the Deccan mares I knew, with a rougher coat and a suspicious eye. He did not know my hand, and I did not yet know his language. Still, the feel of a moving back under me, the sway of a neck, the rhythm of hooves on packed earth, did something to straighten my spine.

Ibrahim rode on a sturdy pony at my side, his clothes different from the day I had first seen him in the fisher village. Now he wore a short coat over his vest, its pockets bulging with something that clinked softly when he moved.

“Gifts,” he said when he saw me glance. “Information costs, *bhau*. So do favours. When we reach the hall, remember that.”

Ahead, the road dipped. A narrow inlet cut into the land, its water dark and still. Boats lay drawn up along its banks, some broad-bellied cargo craft, others slender canoes for river work. The smell of fish was strong here, mixed with the smoke of cooking fires.

On a rise beyond the inlet, a structure of wood and stone looked down on everything.

It was not large, not compared to the great forts of the north, but there was purpose in every line. The outer wall was of red stone blocks, rough, topped with a parapet from which musketeers could fire. Within that wall rose a long hall with an open front, its wooden pillars carved with curling motifs of vines and tigers. Behind the hall, on higher ground, I glimpsed the start of a rampart that ran inland, following the shape of the land.

“This is only one claw,” Ibrahim said softly. “The kingdom itself is the beast.”

Guards in white cotton and dark sashes watched us approach. They carried matchlocks and spears, their posture alert but not nervous. One recognised Ibrahim and raised a hand in greeting.

“The king is in council,” he said. “You are expected.”

The words sent a little shock through me. In most kingdoms I had known, days would pass between a stranger's arrival and an audience with the ruler. Messages would be sent. Names would be checked. Here I had crossed a few hills from a minor compound and already the king himself waited at the end of the road.

They took our horses. As I dismounted, the coastal animal tossed its head and snorted. I patted its neck without thinking, feeling the warm hide, smelling sweat and salt. My bandaged fingers ached with the remembered absence of Kanka. This horse did not know me. Kanka would have nudged my shoulder.

We climbed a short flight of stone steps to the hall.

Inside, the air was cooler. The roof was high enough to let smoke and heat rise, yet low enough that one could still hear the sea beyond when the hall fell quiet. Mats covered the floor. Men sat cross-legged in loose rows, leaving a clear space in the centre.

At the far end, on a slightly raised wooden platform, a man sat with a spear resting against his shoulder and a rolled map on the mat before him.

He wore no crown. His hair was tied back, his forehead marked with the simple lines of a Vaishnavite devotee. His upper body was bare save for a single cloth thrown over one shoulder. A sword lay within easy reach, its hilt polished by use, not ornament.

At his side sat another man with sharp, fine features and a thin frame wrapped in a plain white cloth. In front of him lay a low table with palm leaf bundles, ink and a stylus. His eyes moved constantly, taking in everything, even when the king's attention seemed fixed on the map. Men near us whispered that this was his diwan, Ramayyan, a man who spoke Persian and Dutch and the trade tongues of this coast.

“Marthanda Varma,” Ibrahim murmured. “And his diwan. Remember what I said about gifts.”

We stepped forward. Conversations dimmed. The back of my neck prickled, as it always did when I walked alone into a space where everyone else already knew their place.

I bowed. Not as deeply as a subject would, but enough to acknowledge the man on the platform as something other than a fellow soldier.

“Your Majesty,” Ibrahim said, his voice smooth. “This is the Maratha rider I wrote of. He comes from Portuguese chains and storm water, and he carries knowledge of both.”

Marthanda Varma's eyes left the map and settled on me.

They were dark, steady eyes, the kind that measure before they strike. I had seen such eyes in generals' tents and in the glare of men who held small forts against impossible odds. There was nothing soft in them, but there was nothing careless either.

He spoke then, in Malayalam, the syllables unfamiliar on my ear. His gaze did not leave my face.

Ramayyan's Konkani followed a heartbeat later. “The Maharaja asks if you were on the ship that broke near our fishermen's village.”

“Yes,” I said. “I was.”

The king spoke again in his own tongue, a shorter question this time.

“He asks if you rode for the Peshwa,” Ramayyan translated.

“I did.”

Another question, another soft roll of Malayalam.

“You raided Portuguese outposts on the western roads that feed their ports,” came the diwan's version.

“I did.”

The king's hand flicked toward my bandaged fingers.

“They questioned you,” Ramayyan said for him.

“They tried.”

Something like amusement flickered in Marthanda Varma's gaze, gone as quickly as it came. If he understood my answers without his minister's help, he gave no sign beyond the speed with which his eyes moved.

He said a few more words in Malayalam, and Ramayyan pointed to a mat laid out a few paces away.

“Sit,” the diwan said. “Speak. Tell him how they fight now on your coast. Tell him how their forts stand, how their captains think, how quickly they can bring ships when a local chief resists.”

I sat. The diwan's eyes stayed on me, unblinking. His hand hovered over his stylus, ready to scratch on palm leaves anything he deemed worth remembering.

For the next while, time lost its edges.

I spoke of the Portuguese guns at Chaul and Daman, of bastions built thick and low so cannonballs skipped off instead of biting deep. I described their habit of keeping their best men close to the flag and sending raw or half-sick garrisons to watch the lonely outposts.

As for their papers and priests, I could only repeat what our banias and Brahmin clerks muttered in camp, that the Portuguese wrapped promises in palm leaves and made them tighter than ropes, that their padres walked ahead of soldiers with crosses held high, talking of one God while the men behind them counted how many guns a king could spare. We had heard of small rajas along this coast who signed such bargains thinking European friends would keep neighbours away, and found instead that they had invited a hungry wolf into their courtyards.

The king listened without interruption. Only occasionally did his fingers move on the spear shaft, a small adjustment, a tiny tap. The diwan wrote nothing at first. Then, as I began to speak of cavalry and how Portuguese infantry responded to sudden movement on their flanks, his hand moved, scratching quick notes.

At one point Marthanda Varma leaned forward, touched the map before him and spoke in Malayalam, tapping a point where a river mouth met the sea.

Ramayyan supplied the question in Konkani. “Here. This river mouth. How many days from their nearest stronghold at full sail?”

I closed my eyes for a moment, picturing the coastline as I had last seen it from the back of my horse. I thought of wind, of the usual routes, of how many days it had taken for replacement ships to arrive after we had burned a warehouse.

“If the wind favours them,” I said, “three days. Four if they are unlucky. Longer if someone whispers wrong directions into the ear of a pilot.”

Before the diwan could shape the words for him, the king looked up, eyes narrowing.

He said something sharp in Malayalam, only a few syllables.

“You mistrust pilots?” Ramayyan translated, but I had the prickling sense that the Maharaja already understood more than he chose to show.

“I mistrust everyone who touches a coin,” I said. “But men who steer ships can be made to see profit in many directions.”

The corner of his mouth twitched again.

“Ram,” he said without looking at the diwan.

“Already marked, Maharaja,” Ramayyan replied. His voice was soft, almost gentle. It did not match the sharpness of his gaze.

When I had finished, the hall felt oddly still, as if it were waiting for something.

Marthanda Varma spoke at length in Malayalam, his tone even. I caught none of the words, only the weight.

Ramayyan's translation carried the edge. “He says you speak as if you have counted men and ships for years, yet your own masters failed to keep you from their dungeons.”

The words were not meant as an insult. They were simple fact. Still, they stung.

“Any war has its losses,” I said. “I misjudged a patrol near the coast. I paid the price. That does not make my other calculations less true.”

The diwan turned the answer into Malayalam with a few quick phrases. The king listened, eyes unreadable. Then he spoke again, this time more briefly.

“He says, perhaps,” Ramayyan told me. “And he asks Ibrahim if he trusts you.”

“As far as one can trust a man who owes you his life and hates the same enemies,” Ibrahim said in Konkani. “Beyond that, trust is for priests.”

The king chuckled once, a dry sound that needed no translation.

Ramayyan murmured something in Malayalam that made Marthanda Varma's mouth twitch.

For a few breaths the Maharaja studied me in silence.

He spoke again in Malayalam, gesturing briefly toward the inlet and the wall behind him.

“He says they already have horses from the Nawab of Arcot,” Ramayyan translated. “Men who ride well enough. They have their own Nair warriors who can fight on foot or on small horses in this soil. They have Dutch fortifications in their minds, thanks to other Europeans who have chosen to be practical rather than loyal. He asks what you add that he does not already have.”

It was the same question that had been asked in the coastal compound, only sharpened by the fact that this time it came from the mouth of a man who could, with a word, have me thrown back to the Portuguese or consigned to some pepper estate as expendable labour.

I looked past him for a moment, out through the open side of the hall. From here, I could see the inlet below, the boats moored there, the stretch of sand beyond. Men moved like ants along the shore, unloading sacks, checking nets, shouting to one another in Malayalam.

Above them all the sea lay, flat and deceptive. Somewhere beyond that horizon sat Goa, with its dungeons. Somewhere farther still, Dutch hulls cut through foaming water, carrying men who believed pepper and souls could belong to them by right.

“You have horse from Arcot,” I said slowly. “You have Nair warriors who know this land as they know their own pulse. You have guns and forts and men from across the sea who teach you how Europeans think. What you do not yet have is someone who has ridden into a European line and felt it break. Someone who has watched their neat formations falter not from fear of God, but because a hoof struck at the right moment in the right place.”

I thought of Kanka then, of wet sand beneath his hooves near Chaul, of Portuguese musketeers flinching when our horses came at an angle they had not drilled for. I thought of Keshavrao's eyes in the storm, and the weight I now carried.

“You have men who can build ships and forts,” I said. “I can help you turn speed into a weapon against men who think their guns make them untouchable. I can help you teach your riders not to fear the sound of European volleys. I can show them where to strike, when to pull away, how to make men who drilled on flat European fields die confused on this coast.”

The diwan turned my words into Malayalam. The hall remained quiet. Somewhere outside a bird called. The waves hissed on the sand.

Marthanda Varma tapped the butt of his spear against the mat once, twice.

“Ram,” he said.

The diwan inclined his head.

In Konkani, for my benefit, he said, “The Nawab's horsemen know the straight charge. They do not know the feint and vanish the way Deccan riders do. Our Maravar riders fight bravely, but not yet with discipline against guns. You could help shape that.”

The king smiled thinly at his minister's summary. He said something brief in Malayalam, his gaze returning to me.

“He says I always see the two faces of the coin,” Ramayyan translated, amused. “And he says, very well, Nagoji Sawant. For now, you are not a guest. You are not yet a servant either. You are an experiment.”

Marthanda Varma glanced past me toward the open hall and spoke again.

“He says that outside this fort a strip of land runs along the shore, too wet for most cavalry work, too narrow for big batteries,” the diwan went on. “It is also where the Dutch will expect us to be weakest. He tells you to take the Arcot horse and a hundred Maravar riders and show him something there he has not already imagined. And he says that if you are wrong, you will find Travancore worse than the Portuguese.”

The way Ramayyan relayed it made it clear that his king had imagined a great deal.

I rose, ignoring the pull of healing wounds.

“As he commands,” I said.

The Maharaja spoke once more in Malayalam, his voice lower.

“He says I am to give you what you need,” Ramayyan translated. “And he says you are not to waste men. He has spent too many lives to sit on that mat. He does not throw them away lightly, not even when the gods demand it.”

The diwan stood, gathering his palm leaves.

“Come,” he said. “Let us see what a storm can do when given horse instead of chains.”

As I followed him out of the hall, the roar of the sea grew louder. For the first time since Goa, my blood beat in my veins with something other than pain and stubbornness.

Storms had tried to kill me. Now I would learn whether I could become one.

As I walked, my hand went to my hip, to the empty place where a sword should hang. Not in threat, but in promise. *I will serve this king,* I told myself. *I will harden his riders and break his enemies. When that debt is paid, I will turn north again, find Chimaji, and burn the Portuguese out of Goa, stone by bloody stone.*

For now, Travancore was the forge. But the blade was meant for another war.
