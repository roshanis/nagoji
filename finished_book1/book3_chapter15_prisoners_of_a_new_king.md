# Chapter 15: Prisoners of a New King

The end came with a lie, or perhaps just a misunderstanding of what honour meant on this coast.

For two days after the explosion, De Lannoy went back and forth between our lines and the Dutch camp. He carried terms, counter-terms, and the slow grinding of pride against reality. On the twelfth of August, the capitulation was signed. On the thirteenth, the Dutch marched out.

The smoke had cleared by then, but the smell lingered, ash and burnt powder mixed with the salt of the sea. They had signalled their readiness to treat. Terms had been agreed upon, or so they believed.

They marched out of their ruined camp at mid-morning.

It was a strange sight. Beaten men, coats stained with soot and blood, yet forming ranks with their drums beating. They carried their muskets. Their officers wore their swords. The agreement was that they would be compelled to surrender the fort but allowed to march with their arms to the Dutch factory at Kanyakumari.

I sat on my horse near the dunes, watching them come.

“They look relieved,” Dhanaji said. “They think they are going for a long walk and then a boat home.”

“The King does not let tigers walk away because they promise not to bite,” I said.

Marthanda Varma waited on the rise where our main battery had stood. His Nair infantry lined the path the Dutch were taking, silent, impassive.

When the last Dutch soldier had stepped away from the charred remains of the stockade, the trap snapped shut.

A conch blew.

Suddenly, the Nair lines thickened. Spears lowered. Matchlocks were raised from behind the dunes where my riders had waited. The path to Kanyakumari was blocked by a wall of shields.

The Dutch column halted. Confusion rippled through their ranks. Their senior officer, a man named Donnadi who had commanded in De Lannoy's absence, shouted something and pointed his sword toward the road.

Ramayyan rode forward, with De Lannoy at his side.

"The road is closed," Ramayyan said, his voice carrying over the wind. "You are prisoners of the State of Travancore."

"We have terms!" Donnadi shouted back, his face darkening with rage. Then his eyes found De Lannoy on our side, a strip of Travancore cloth knotted across his stained blue coat, and something harder crossed his features. "Traitor. You negotiated this trap."

"I negotiated your lives," De Lannoy called back in Dutch. "The alternative was to let you starve until the monsoon drowned what the siege did not kill. Take what is offered, Joseph."

"You have marched out," Ramayyan said calmly. "Now you will drop the arms."

For a moment, I thought they would fight. I saw hands tighten on musket stocks. I saw Donnadi's knuckles turn white on his hilt. They were surrounded, outnumbered twenty to one, starving and shocked, but they were soldiers.

I watched Donnadi's face through my glass. I had seen that expression before, on Keshavrao's face in the storm, on my own in the Goan dungeon. The moment when a man realizes that every road leads to the same wall.

His lips moved. I could not hear the words, but I saw him look at the sky, then down at his boots, then at the young drummer boy standing rigid beside him. The boy could not have been more than fourteen. His hands were shaking on his drumsticks.

Donnadi reached out and put a hand on the boy's shoulder. Something passed between them, permission, perhaps, or apology. The boy's face crumpled, then steadied.

Then Donnadi looked at his men, hollow-eyed, burnt, swaying with fatigue. He looked at the thousands of fresh Nair troops ringing them. He looked at the sea behind him, where the ships had drawn back like spectators who did not want to be splashed by blood. And he looked at De Lannoy, standing with the enemy, already wearing their cloth.

He swore, a short, sharp sound. Then he unbuckled his sword belt.

He did not throw it. He held it for a moment, the leather warm from his body, the brass of the hilt catching the sun. I saw his thumb trace the Company insignia, the VOC monogram that had been his identity since he was a boy in the Low Countries dreaming of foreign shores.

Then he let it fall. It landed in the sand with a soft thud, not a clatter. A quiet death for a quiet surrender.

"Down," he ordered, his voice cracking on the word.

The clatter of hundreds of muskets falling onto the beach sounded like a heavy rain. Some of the men wept. Others stood rigid, staring at nothing. One sergeant knelt and pressed his forehead to his fallen weapon, as if saying goodbye to an old friend.

“Take them,” Varma said.

We took twenty-three European officers that day, with Joseph Donnadi the senior among them. We took hundreds of soldiers, their muskets, their drums, and the few cannon that had not burst in the fire. De Lannoy, who had crossed to us eleven days before, watched his former comrades march into captivity with an expression I could not read.

We did not march them to Kanyakumari. We marched them inland, away from the sea that had failed to save them, to the granite walls of Udayagiri Fort.

The next morning, before the prisoners had even been sorted and counted, Ibrahim Marakkar appeared at the beach.

He came not from the inland roads but from the sea itself, his small boat sliding through the surf with the ease of a man who had spent his life reading these waters. Behind him, a second boat carried crates and bundles wrapped in oiled cloth.

I watched from the dunes as he stepped onto the sand, his bare feet finding purchase where Dutch boots had stumbled. He surveyed the wreckage of the company camp with the eye of a merchant appraising goods at auction.

“You move quickly,” I said, walking down to meet him.

“The sea moves quickly,” he replied. “I merely follow its currents.”

He gestured to the burned stockade, the scattered equipment, the abandoned positions.

“There will be salvage,” he said. “Rope, metal, cloth. Things the company left behind in their haste to surrender. Things that have no flag now.”

“Those belong to the king,” I said.

“Some do,” Ibrahim agreed. “The cannon, certainly. The muskets. But the small things? The cook pots and the sail canvas and the personal effects of men who will never need them again?” He smiled. “Those find their way into other hands. They always have. Since the first ship wrecked on this coast, men like my grandfather have known where to look.”

“And you happened to be nearby,” I said. “Ready to look.”

“I happened to be watching from a safe distance,” he said. “As I always do when large men with guns disagree. It is healthier.”

His crew had begun unloading the second boat. It was not salvage, I realised, but supplies. Rice. Dried fish. Coconut oil. The small necessities that an army needs after a battle.

“For the prisoners,” Ibrahim said, following my gaze. “They will need to eat. The king will want them alive and useful, not starved into uselessness. This is my contribution.”

“Generous,” I said.

“Practical,” he corrected. “Marthanda Varma will remember who fed his new recruits. And if the Dutch ever return, they will remember who was kind to their countrymen in captivity.” He shrugged. “A man who is remembered kindly by both sides is a man who survives.”

“Is that all you care about? Surviving?”

Ibrahim looked at me, and for a moment the merchant's mask slipped.

“I care about this coast,” he said quietly. “My family has traded here for three hundred years. We have seen the Portuguese come and fade. Now the Dutch fade. Tomorrow it will be someone else. But the Marakkars remain.” He tapped his chest. “We remain because we never forget that the sea belongs to no one. It only lends itself to those clever enough to use it.”

He turned back to his boats, already calling orders to his men.

“Tell your king his prisoners will not starve on my account,” he said over his shoulder. “And tell Ramayyan I will have the full inventory of Dutch salvage on his table by nightfall. For the usual consideration, of course.”

I watched him work, this man who fed both sides and swore loyalty to neither, and wondered which was more dangerous: an enemy you could see, or a friend you could never quite trust.

---

Two days later, I stood in a stone courtyard within Udayagiri.

The air here was different, still heavy with moisture, but held close by the hills and the high walls. The Dutch officers had been separated from their men. They were kept in the upper quarters, treated better than common prisoners but watched by guards who never blinked.

Marthanda Varma had summoned Lannoy.

The meeting took place in a small hall used for private audiences. No throne, just a low platform and simple mats. Ramayyan was there, of course, his stylus ready.

And beside him sat Mathoo Tharakan. He was no longer just the merchant I had seen at the war council. Today, he wore the heavy gold chains and silk tunic of a *Sarvadhi Karyakkar*, a high noble of the court. Marthanda Varma had elevated him, breaking centuries of caste tradition to place a Syrian Christian at the heart of his durbar. It was a statement as loud as any cannon: in this new Travancore, power flowed to those who built the state, regardless of the god they prayed to.

To my Deccan eyes it still felt like a boundary crossed. But the Syrian houses of this coast were not meek converts huddled outside the warrior order. They trained in the same kalari pits as Nairs, carried steel when the kingdom called, and stood in the old hierarchy closer to horse and musket than to plough. The king was shocking some priests, yes, but he was not inventing a new world from nothing.

I stood by the door, silent witness.

Lannoy was brought in. He looked better than he had on the beach: washed, his wound bandaged, though his coat was still the same stained blue. He did not bow.

“You have a strange way of keeping treaties,” he said, his voice flat.

Marthanda Varma studied him.

“I keep the treaties that benefit my people,” the king said. “Allowing an enemy army to march to another fort so they can attack me again next year does not benefit anyone but you.”

“Honour,” Lannoy began.

“Honour is eating well and sleeping without fear,” Varma cut him off. “Dead men have no honour. You are alive. That is the only term that matters.”

Lannoy fell silent. He knew enough of war to know that the loser does not dictate the vocabulary of the aftermath.

“You are Eustachius De Lannoy,” the king said. “You know guns. You know drill. You know how to build forts that do not burn when a lucky shot hits them.”

“I am a Captain of the Dutch East India Company.”

“The Company is a ledger,” Varma said.

“And a ledger with too much red ink is burnt,” Tharakan interjected softly, his voice carrying the weight of a man who owned half the warehouses on the coast.

“It has already written you off,” the king continued, nodding at his noble. “Do you think they will send a fleet to rescue a man who lost a beachhead? They will count the cost, shake their heads, and hire a new captain.”

Ramayyan had already shown him damp letters taken from the wrecked Dutch camp. One, in the Governor's careful hand from Cochin, admitted that the company had been “successful at first, but for want of men and other necessaries had to leave him master of the field.” Varma did not need enemy ink to know the truth, but he enjoyed hearing it from their own mouths.

Lannoy flinched. It was a small movement, but it betrayed him.

“What do you want?” he asked.

“I want you to build me an army that fights like yours,” Varma said. “But better. Because it will fight for its own land, not for pepper prices.”

“You want me to turn my coat.”

“I want you to change your master,” Varma said. “Serve me. Train my men. Cast cannon for us. Build walls that stand.”

“And if I refuse?”

“Then you remain in Udayagiri,” Ramayyan said. “Not as a guest, but as a prisoner. You will rot here while the world forgets your name. And eventually, you will die here, of fever or old age, wondering what you might have built.”

Lannoy looked at the stone floor. He looked at the window, where the green hills of Travancore rose against the sky.

“And if I accept?”

“You keep your sword,” Varma said. “You keep your rank. You rise as high as your skill takes you. You become the Valiya Kappittan, the Great Captain of my forces.”

It was a staggering offer. To go from a prisoner in a dungeon to the commander of the army that had defeated him.

Lannoy looked at me.

“You were a mercenary once,” he said. “Before you were a courtier.”

“I am still a mercenary,” I said. “I just found a paymaster who offers more than coin.”

“And does he keep his word?”

“He kept me alive when others would have hanged me,” I said. “And he let you live when he could have let the Nair boys spear you on the beach.”

Lannoy took a long breath. He looked at his hands, then at the King.

“I have men,” he said. “Donnadi. The others.”

“They can serve too,” Varma said. “Or they can wait. The choice is theirs. But the offer starts with you.”

The silence stretched. I could see the calculation in the Dutchman’s eyes. The loyalty to a distant flag warring with the reality of the stone walls and the indifference of the corporate master he had served.

“I will not fight against the Dutch,” he said finally.

“I do not need you to fight them,” Varma said, a smile touching his lips. “I need you to make sure I do not have to fight them again. Or if I do, that they lose even faster.”

Lannoy nodded slowly.

“Then,” he said, “I accept.”

Marthanda Varma did not rise. He simply nodded to Ramayyan.

“Good,” the King said. “Ram will draw up the papers. You start tomorrow.”

“Tomorrow?” Lannoy looked surprised.

“The war isn't over just because you surrendered,” Varma said. “There are other factories. Other chiefs. There is always work. Go. Sleep. You will need your strength.”

As guards escorted the new Great Captain out, Ramayyan looked up from his leaf.

“He will be useful,” the Dalawa said.

“He will be a weapon,” Varma said. “And like any weapon, we must make sure he points away from us.”

He looked at me.

“That will be part of your task, Nagoji. You speak his language. You know his kind. Watch him. Be his friend holding the shield.”

“Friendship with a man who walked away from his own flag is a complicated thing,” I said.

“Life is complicated,” Marthanda Varma said, standing up and reaching for his spear. “That includes surviving it. The simple things usually end in funerals.”

We walked out into the courtyard of Udayagiri. The sun was high now. The Dutch prisoners, no, the Dutch recruits, were being fed in the lower yard. They looked up as we passed, fear mixing with curiosity.

They did not know it yet, but they had just become the seed of the Travancore Nair Brigade.

---

Lannoy's first morning as a Travancore officer began before dawn.

I found him in the courtyard, still wearing his stained Dutch coat, staring at the pile of local cloth that had been left outside his door. A white *mundu*, a simple cotton tunic, sandals of a kind he had probably never worn.

“They expect me to dress as one of them,” he said.

“They expect you to stop dressing as their enemy,” I said. “The coat is a problem. Men who lost brothers at Colachel will not take orders from a man who wears the uniform that killed them.”

He touched the brass buttons, running his thumb along the Company insignia.

“I have worn this since I was seventeen,” he said. “It was the first thing I bought with my own wages. My mother sewed the lining herself before I left Arras for the sea.”

“Your mother is in Arras,” I said. “You are in Travancore. The coat cannot follow you where you are going.”

He stood very still for a long moment.

Then, slowly, he unbuttoned it. The brass clicked softly in the morning quiet. He folded the coat with the care of a man folding a shroud and set it on the stone bench beside him.

Beneath it, his shirt was sweat-stained, his chest pale where the sun had never reached.

He picked up the white *mundu* and looked at it as if it were a map of an unknown country.

“Show me,” he said.

I showed him how to wrap it, how to tuck the end so it would not unravel during drill, how to move without tripping over the unfamiliar length. He fumbled twice, cursed in Flemish, then got it right on the third attempt.

When he straightened, he looked like a ghost of himself, a European skeleton wearing Indian skin.

“Do I look ridiculous?” he asked.

“You look like a man who has not yet learned to stand in his new clothes,” I said. “That will change. The cloth is easy. The hard part is what happens when you give your first order and a Nair captain looks at your pale face and wonders why he should obey.”

“What do I do then?”

“You show him something he respects,” I said. “Not your old rank. Not your old flag. Something new. Competence. Fairness. The willingness to stand in the same sun and eat the same rice.”

He nodded slowly.

“The rice,” he said, “is going to take some getting used to.”

“So is everything else,” I said. “Welcome to Travancore, Kappittan.”

He did not smile. But something in his face shifted, the first crack in the wall between what he had been and what he might become.

That evening, I saw him walking the ramparts alone, the Dutch coat still folded on his bench, untouched. He had not thrown it away. Perhaps he never would.

But he was not wearing it.

History is strange. It turns on a lucky shot, a broken promise, and a conversation in a stone room.

I looked at the walls of the fort. They were strong. But with Lannoy’s help, I knew they would become stronger. And Travancore, this slip of land between the mountains and the sea, would become something no one, not even the great Companies of Europe, could swallow.
