# Chapter 10: Lessons in Travancore

In the Deccan, a kingdom revealed itself in its forts.

You could stand on a bastion and read a ruler's mind in stone and mortar; how high he built his walls, how thick he poured his lime, where he dug his wells, where he placed his cannon. Temples and markets came later, clustering under the shadow of those choices.

In Travancore, I learned, you had to listen in different places.

Ramayyan taught me that, though he never called it teaching. He simply appeared one morning outside the quarters Padmini Amma had assigned me, his plain white cloth as neat as if it had never seen dust, his palm leaves under one arm.

“Walk with me, Sawant,” he said.

When the diwan of a kingdom tells you to walk, you do not ask where.

We started at the temple.

Not the great shrine at Padmanabhaswamy, which I had heard of but not yet seen, but a smaller temple on a hill above a cluster of houses and pepper gardens. Its gopuram was modest by southern standards, its stone steps worn hollow in the centre by generations of feet. It was dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, the forest warrior, brother of Ganapati and patron of all who carried arms in these hills. 

As we climbed, women and men stepped aside to let Ramayyan pass, murmuring greetings. He returned each with the same small nod, storing something behind his eyes.

Inside the outer courtyard, Brahmins moved through their rituals like men repeating a song they had sung since childhood. Oil lamps flickered. Bells chimed. The smell of ghee and incense wound itself around the stone pillars.

At the innermost threshold, where in some other temples a Deccan non-Brahmins like me might have been kept back, Ramayyan stopped and turned.

“You do not have to go closer,” he said. “The god knows you have your own ways.”

“Gods and I have an understanding,” I said. “I try not to waste their time.”

He smiled faintly.

“Watch instead,” he said.

We stood just inside the shade of the mandapa, where we could see both the sanctum and the outer courtyard.

“Who pays for the oil in those lamps?” he asked.

“The temple,” I said. “From offerings.”

“Where do the offerings come from?”

I thought of the boys in the kalari, of women sorting pepper, of carts groaning under loads of paddy.

“From the fields,” I said. “From houses like Padmini Amma's.”

“And who pays when the temple roof leaks, when the priest demands new ornaments for the god, when the elephant that carries the idol in procession goes lame?”

“The king,” I said. “If he is wise.”

“If he wants men to believe the god favours his reign,” Ramayyan said. “A temple is not just stone. It is a ledger. Offerings in. Blessings out. The names written on both sides matter.”

He nodded toward a wall where dozens of small lamps burned in niches.

“Each of those lamps is paid for by a house,” he said. “Some by Padmini's line. Some by fishermen. Some by men who own no land but rent their backs to others. When the king repairs this temple, they all see it. When he asks for extra tax to pay for muskets and forts, they remember whether he feeds their god.”

We left the temple and walked down toward the market.

There, under awnings of cloth and palm leaves, the kingdom took another shape. Traders from the interior haggled over sacks of rice and oil. Marakkar men bartered for pepper and cardamom, their eyes constantly flicking toward the path that led to the backwaters. An Arab merchant in a flowing white robe sat cross-legged on a raised platform, weighing silver *chuckrams* on a small brass scale while his servant counted sacks of pepper, each sack a *candi*, I had learned, roughly five hundred pounds, the measure by which fortunes were made or lost on this coast. Nearby, a Syrian Christian scribe sat with a low desk, writing contracts in a hand that flowed like water; beside him, a stack of *hundis*, bills of exchange that could turn pepper in Travancore into gold in Muscat without a single coin crossing the sea.

“Do you see the pattern?” Ramayyan asked.

“I see men arguing over coins,” I said. “That is the same everywhere.”

“Look closer,” he murmured.

Near one stall, a Marakkar captain I recognised from the coastal hall, not Ibrahim but his cousin Yusuf, leaned across a table piled with cloth.

“If your pepper is worm eaten,” he said in Malayalam, “my mast will refuse to carry it. The Dutch will not pay for rot.”

The woman behind the stall, not much older than Revathi Bayi but with a baby slung on her hip, folded her arms.

“My pepper has fewer worms than your honesty,” she said. “Your ships carry news as well as goods. When you bring Dutch coins into our land, remember that the king counts them with his fingers, not yours.”

Yusuf laughed, but his eyes flicked sideways, toward the street where Ramayyan and I stood, then briefly toward a pale faced factor further along the market. The scribe at his side made a tiny adjustment in the figures he had been writing.

“The king's tax sits between them,” Ramayyan said. “Too high, the Marakkar captain goes to another coast. Too low, the queen in Padmanabhapuram cannot buy Dutch guns to shoot back at Dutch ships.”

“You walk these places every day?” I asked.

“As often as I can,” he said. “A diwan who hears only petitions in the court knows half a kingdom. The other half lives here, in the way people say 'our pepper' and 'the king's pepper' as if they are the same, or as if they are not.”

From the market we went to the training ground.

It lay on a flat strip of land just inland from the coastal fort, where the ground was firm enough to bear the pounding of many feet. Men in white stood in lines two deep, matchlocks on their shoulders. A stocky European in a stained coat moved along the front rank, shouting commands in harsh, broken Hindustani.

Not De Lannoy. Not yet. This man was older, his belly soft, his eyes wary. One of the earlier European mercenaries who had sold his skill where he could.

“Ram, my friend,” he called when he saw us. “You come to see how well they march?”

“I come to see whether they can do more than march,” Ramayyan said mildly.

The European scowled.

“One thing at a time,” he said. “First they learn left from right.”

He barked an order. The front rank stepped forward, brought muskets down, primed, raised, aimed. On the next word the line fired as one. Smoke rolled out in a white sheet, stinging my eyes even from the side. The smell of saltpetre and burned powder wrapped itself around us.

“Adequate,” Ramayyan said.

“Praise indeed,” I murmured.

He glanced at me.

“Our men must learn this European dance,” he said, “or they will die confused when the Dutch play their drums. But this is only one rhythm. Yours is another. The temple has its own. The market too. A kingdom survives when these rhythms do not trip each other up.”

We walked on, down toward the backwaters.

There, in the maze of narrow channels and broad lagoons, the kingdom's veins opened.

Boats moved along the water like insects, some small, with one or two men poling, others broad and low, piled with sacks. The water's surface reflected palm fronds and sky in shards that broke and reformed with every ripple.

We found Ibrahim on a narrow quay, shouting at a man who was trying to load too many barrels onto a single boat.

“Do you want to sit on them?” he demanded. “If the boat sinks, the fish will have a feast and the Dutch will laugh.”

He broke off when he saw us.

“Diwanji,” he said, touching his forehead. “Sawant. Come to see how your horses eat?”

“Horses do not like water,” I said. “I admire anyone who rides it as if it were a road.”

Ibrahim grinned.

“Water is a road,” he said. “A road no company can draw a line through. They can put forts on the banks, but the backwaters go where they wish.”

Ramayyan rested his hand on one of the barrels.

“Pepper,” he said.

“And a little cardamom,” Ibrahim said. “Enough to flavour a Dutchman's breath and his profits.”

“And for the king?” Ramayyan asked.

“His share is already in his godowns,” Ibrahim said. “I am not fool enough to cheat the man whose scribes have longer memories than my own mother.”

Ramayyan's eyes crinkled at the edges.

“See,” he said to me as we left the quay. “Horses carry men to battle. Boats carry the coin that pays for their feed. Temples carry the stories that make those men willing to die. Markets carry the arguments over who deserves what. If you ride only on the training field, you will know how to move men. If you walk these other paths, you will know why they move.”

By the time the sun leaned westward, my legs ached more from walking than they had from a morning's ride. My head, too, buzzed with the weight of new connections.

In Pune, the world had been simple. Orders came. Men rode. Villages paid. Priests blessed. Merchants complained. Europeans were enemies to be raided, occasionally bargained with, rarely understood.

Here, everything tied to everything else with threads I had not seen at first. A temple roof and a musket barrel and a boat's cargo and a pepper vine and a boy in a kalari and a woman on a mat counting coins all tugged on the same knot.

As we climbed back up toward the coastal hall, the sea appeared again, a flat line of grey and blue beyond the inlet.

“You see now why the Maharaja thinks of war even when he sits in a temple courtyard,” Ramayyan said. “For him, conquest is not only taking land. It is knitting these pieces together so that when a Dutch cannon fires at one place, the rest does not unravel.”

“He is already at war,” I said. “Even when the Dutch have not fired.”

“He has been at war since before he took the throne,” Ramayyan said. “First with his own family. Then with the chieftains who thought him a boy.” He glanced toward the fort above us. “In the early years he turned his sword inward, against the Lords of the Eight Houses that once strangled this land and the temple yogakkar who thought the gods answered only to them. They sent assassins as often as petitions: a bowman on a palace roof, poison in lamp oil, a dagger in a festival crowd. Some of those men died on pikes, some in exile, some under the weight of their own ruined walls. Only after those knots were cut could he afford to reach outward, toward Kayamkulam and the other neighbours, and then toward Dutch cannon. Men like you feel war when the drums beat. Men like him feel it when a ledger does not balance.”

We reached the hall. The day was nearly done. Men inside already sat over palm leaves and cups of buttermilk, murmuring over plans.

Ramayyan paused at the threshold.

“You have a sharp eye, Sawant,” he said. “You see angles on a battlefield. See these angles too. When the time comes, the Maharaja will expect you to ride in ways that suit them. Not only your own.”

“He has my sword,” I said. “My eyes he can borrow when he asks.”

He regarded me for a moment, as if tasting the shape of my answer.

“Borrowed eyes,” he said. “We will see how long he keeps the loan.”

That conversation was the first lesson. The application came soon after.

The months blurred into seasons, the seasons into years.

I marked time not by calendars but by campaigns: the wet season when we rode against the Kayamkulam chiefs, the dry season when we fortified the northern passes, the monsoon when even horses learned to pray for solid ground. Each year the kingdom grew a little larger, a little tighter, a little more certain of its shape.

In those years before the Dutch clouds fully gathered, the King turned his “borrowed eyes” inward as Ramayyan had promised.

We rode not against foreign armies, but against the stubborn knots of the internal map. I learned that a “campaign” in Travancore did not always mean a pitched battle. Sometimes it meant riding with Padmini Amma to a chieftain's estate, a man who had formerly pledged loyalty to one of the Eight Houses, and standing silently by the gate while she negotiated the grain levy. My presence, and the fifty Maravar lancers behind me, turned a “request” into a “requirement.”

Other times, it was sharper.

I remember a raid on a recalcitrant *madampi* near Attingal who refused to send his men for the new army drills. He thought his high walls and thick bamboo groves would protect him from a young King's decrees. He did not know that Ramayyan had mapped his supply lines, or that I had trained a unit of Maravar horsemen to cut through bamboo dampness as if it were dry grass.

We took his walls at dawn. There was no glory in it, only the brutal efficiency of state-building. I watched as the King, standing in the smoking courtyard of a house that had been noble for three centuries, offered the defeated chief a choice: total submission or total erasure. The chief chose submission. His sons marched with us the next week.

“You see?” Marthanda Varma told me as we rode back, the smell of wet ash still on our clothes. “I do not destroy them because I hate them. I break them so they can be reset into a stronger bone.”

It was during these “years of consolidation” that I stopped being a guest and became a limb of this growing beast. I learned to distinguish the sullen silence of a conquered village from the quiet respect of a protected one. I learned to eat rice from a plantain leaf without spilling it, and to speak enough Malayalam to order a charge or a retreat.

And I learned that peace here was just a word for the time it took to reload.

---

Seasons passed in this way. Dust and rain and the slow grinding of old orders into new shapes. By the time the Dutch began to show their teeth more openly, I had ridden every road in the kingdom at least twice and forgotten what the Deccan hills looked like except in dreams.

One night, back at Padmini Amma's estate, as I sat under the jackfruit tree listening to distant temple bells and nearer kalari shouts, I thought of those early lessons.

Temple to market. Market to training ground. Training ground to backwaters. Backwaters to fort. Fort to palace. Palace to houses like Padmini's. Houses to Velinadu's halls.

In Goa, chains had held me still in one place. Here, invisible cords tied me to many. If one snapped, I had no doubt the others would tighten.

Travancore was already at war, even in its quiet moments. It had just learned to fight with more than swords.

If I wished to survive, I would have to learn the same.
