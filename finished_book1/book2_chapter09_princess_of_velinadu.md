# Chapter 9: Princess of Velinadu


We left Padmini Amma's estate before sunrise, when the sky was the colour of old iron and the air still clung to the night's cool.

The road to Velinadu wound inland at first, away from the sea. We rode through low hills quilted with rubbery green, past ponds where lotus leaves floated like idle coins, past small shrines where bundled cloth and oil lamps clung to the trunks of ancient trees. As the light strengthened, mist lifted off the fields and revealed more of the land's body.

Women with baskets on their hips walked in groups, talking and laughing as they headed for pepper gardens. Men led bullocks toward ploughs. Children chased each other along bunds, their feet sure on narrow ridges that would have sent me tumbling into irrigation channels.

Padmini Amma rode at the head of our little party, side saddle on a compact horse that moved with the confidence of one who knew every stone on the path. She wore more silk than she had at home, but it was still muted, the colours drawn from the earth rather than court paintings. Gold glinted at her throat and wrists. At her right side, a sword hung, its hilt wrapped in worn leather.

I rode a little behind and to her left, close enough to hear her speak without raising her voice, far enough that if she chose to ignore me, she could do so without effort. Ibrahim and two of Padmini's male relatives followed, their eyes scanning the road.

“You have heard of Velinadu,” she said as the path widened into a beaten road. “What did your hills tell you?”

“Stories,” I said. “Of a place where the company men once thought themselves safe until women closed the gates on them. Of a line of queens who could sign treaties without asking anyone's permission.”

“Stories travel badly,” she said. “But the bones of that one are not wrong.”

She pointed ahead with her chin.

“Remember that when you meet Revathi. She carries those bones in her tongue.”

Velinadu Kovilakam was not the city my Deccan mind had expected. There were no towering walls, no massive bastions. Instead, a ring of red stone and earth circled a cluster of buildings and trees. The gates were wide enough for carts and elephants, but the guards who stood there seemed more focused on who entered than what.

They watched Padmini Amma approach with a mixture of respect and calculation.

“Amma,” one of them said, bowing his head. “You come early.”

“I prefer to see a place awake,” she said. “When tongues are still loose from sleep, they forget to lie as well.”

The guard's mouth twitched. His gaze slid to me.

“And this?”

“A rider from the north whom the sea sent back to us,” she said. “The Maharaja plays with him. I thought Velinadu should have its share.”

The guard's eyebrows rose at that, but he stepped aside.

Inside the ring, the ground rose gently toward a cluster of buildings shaded by broad trees. A straight path led to a central hall, its tiled roof flanked by smaller structures. Banners hung from poles, heavy with the morning's stillness. Women moved along the verandahs, some in plain cotton, some in brighter silk, all with their heads uncovered, their hair oiled and coiled or braided as they pleased.

Men were present too, fewer in number, their positions given away by their weapons, their writing tablets, their anxious glances toward doorways where no one had yet appeared.

“Remember,” Padmini Amma said quietly as we dismounted, “you stand in a place where land, not men, is the first thing named. The woman who carries that name can speak with the weight of many fields behind her. Do not address her as if she were a sardar's daughter waiting for a husband to give her meaning.”

“If I forget, I expect you to kick me,” I said.

She smiled, a flash of white teeth.

“That can be arranged.”

We were led to a side verandah and offered seats on woven mats. Servants brought coconut water in brass tumblers and banana leaf parcels of breakfast. The sound of drums came faintly from somewhere deeper within the complex, along with the chiming of bells.

“Ceremony,” Padmini said. “They will make you wait. That is part of the weighing.”

I sipped the cool water, letting it wash away the dust of the road. My stomach, which had once protested at every new coastal spice, had begun to learn the patterns of this land. Rice instead of bhakri. Coconut instead of groundnut. Fish where once there had been mutton.

Waiting is familiar to any soldier. You learn to let your mind drift without losing its edge. Yet as the minutes stretched, my spine tightened in a different way. This was not the tense quiet before a battle, when men cleaned swords and muttered prayers. It was the waiting men endure when summoned before someone who can change their fate with a word.

Footsteps approached. Not the heavy tread of armoured guards, but the light, quick rhythm of someone accustomed to moving through these spaces without being questioned.

A young woman stepped onto the verandah.

She was perhaps a little younger than I, though the way she held herself made guessing her exact years difficult. Her sari was of deep indigo shot with gold, draped in the local style, leaving one shoulder bare. Gold circlets gleamed on her upper arms. At her throat, a necklace of flat coins lay against skin the colour of polished teak.

Her hair was braided and looped, threaded with jasmine. A thin line of sandalwood paste ran along her hairline. Her eyes were dark and level, framed by kohl. When they met mine there was no flutter, no demure dip of lashes.

“Padmini Amma,” she said, inclining her head the smallest fraction. “You come with interesting company.”

“Revathi Bayi,” Padmini said, with the same almost bow. “You asked to see what the southern winds had blown in. I brought him before the salt left his skin.”

Revathi turned her gaze fully on me.

“You are the Maratha rider,” she said in Malayalam, her words precise and cool, each syllable placed slowly enough that even a northerner could not pretend to misunderstand. “The one the Portuguese could not quite break and the sea could not quite keep.”

“So they tell me,” I said.

“You speak our tongue?” she asked.

“I learn it,” I said carefully. “Slowly. Like a horse finding its footing on new ground.”

Her mouth twitched, not quite a smile.

“Good. Men who refuse to learn languages normally insist theirs is the only one that matters. Those men bore me.”

Revathi gestured to the mat opposite.

“Sit,” she said. “If you crane your neck the whole time, you will despise me before we have even argued.”

She sat with liquid ease, folding her legs under her. A servant appeared as if summoned by thought and placed a brass plate of food before her. She ignored it for the moment, eyes still on me.

“You ride for Marthanda Varma now,” she said. It was not a question.

“I ride where I am told,” I said. “At present, that is for your king.”

“My king,” she repeated, tasting the words as if they were unfamiliar. “He sits in Padmanabhapuram. He takes heads when he must and lands when he can. He builds forts and bargains with Dutchmen and Marakkars. He calls this kingdom his. That does not mean the earth beneath his feet has forgotten who owned it before.”

“You prefer the old ways?” I asked.

“I prefer ways that remember their promises,” she said. “The Velinadu line signed pacts with foreigners long before your Maratha court ever saw a European. We bled when those pacts were broken. We killed when they thought our hands too soft to hold swords. Now everyone speaks of the Maharaja's reforms as if the world began when he took the throne.”

There was no shrillness in her tone. Only a steady, simmering annoyance that reminded me of the way seasoned captains spoke of young sardars who thought themselves clever.

She leaned back slightly, studying me.

“And you,” she said. “What letters do you carry on your skin, Sawant?”

“A brand,” I said. I pushed my sleeve up enough to show the Portuguese mark. “Some scars. Joints that ache in the rain. Nothing a scribe would waste ink on.”

“You underestimate scribes,” she said. “They love scars. They make for good stories later.”

She picked up a piece of plantain from her plate at last, but held it between finger and thumb rather than eating.

“They also love patterns,” she went on. “They say you trained the Arcot horse on wet sand. Made them move like the fish I watch at low tide. Ramayyan filled a grove of palm leaves about it.”

“You think you can teach our men to kill Dutch as easily as you killed Portuguese on your hills?” she asked.

“There was nothing easy about it,” I said. “We lost men every time. Horses also. The ground does not care whose blood it drinks.”

“Yet you keep pouring,” she said. “Why?”

“Because if we do not, their flag will cast a shadow over every fort from Nashik to this coast,” I said. “Because in Goa, they tried to erase my name and replace it with a number in a ledger. I have seen their hunger. Give them an inch of riverbank, and they will swallow the whole valley before you have finished signing their treaty.”

Her eyes narrowed slightly.

“On that,” she said, “we agree.”

She picked up a piece of plantain from her plate and ate it slowly, chewing as if the act helped her think.

“You know what this place is?” she asked after a moment, gesturing vaguely toward the hall behind her, the trees, the earth under us.

“Velinadu,” I said. “Land of queens. Land where company men died when they forgot to listen.”

“They did not forget to listen,” she said. “They never thought they had to. That is worse.”

She pointed at the earth between us.

“This land belongs to my line,” she said. “Not to my husband, if I take one. Not to my sons, if I have them. To my sisters. To their daughters. To the name we carry. The company men did not understand that. They thought if they pleased the right man, signed the right paper, they owned the pepper, the trees, the very wind. They were wrong. Now they send different men, different papers.”

Her eyes turned toward the south, where I knew, beyond the curve of the land, Dutch ships rode at anchor somewhere beyond sight.

“Your king,” she went on, “understands some of this. He is not a fool. He knows that if he wants a strong kingdom, he must make peace with the houses that owned land before his uncles did. Yet he also wants to pull all power into his own hands. He builds a state that answers to the crown, not to the old lines. That is good for facing Europeans. It is less good for those of us whose names are older than his.”

She paused, and something shifted in her face. A shadow, there and gone.

“My mother's cousin sits in Kottarakkara,” she said, her tone carefully flat. “Savitri. Of the Elayadathu line. She writes to me sometimes. About the old ways. About what is owed.”

She did not elaborate. The silence stretched a heartbeat longer than it should have.

“Kottarakkara has not yet bent,” Revathi added. “The chief there still remembers what his grandmothers held. Your king circles that house the way a dog circles a wounded bird.”

I did not know the name. I did not know the house. The weight of what she was not saying settled into the air between us like monsoon humidity.

“You fear he will use men like me to cut your houses down,” I said.

“I do not fear,” she said. “Fear is for people who have no knives. I see him giving land and commands to men like you, whose ties to this coast are thin. Easier to shift such men when the time comes. Harder for them to say no.”

She smiled then, but it was a smile with an edge.

“Will you say no, Nagoji Sawant, when he points you at a house that will not bow as deeply as he likes?” she asked. “If he tells you my pepper fields shelter Dutch spies, will you burn them for him?”

The question was hypothetical, but it landed like a thrown dagger. I thought of Padmini's estate, of the boys in the kalari pit, of women sorting pepper under her eye. I thought of my own family fields near Nashik, and what it would feel like to watch them burn on the orders of a king who called himself my protector.

“I ride for the orders I am given,” I said slowly. “But I choose which king I allow to give them. That choice is not made lightly.”

“You have already made it,” she said. “You could have run north when the sea spat you out. Instead you stayed. You drilled horses on sand. You accepted the Maharaja's gaze on your neck. Do not pretend you stand at a crossroads when your feet are already on the path.”

Her bluntness stung because it was true.

“I stayed because he fights Europeans. Because in my hills men argue about who owns which fort while the companies buy whole coasts with a handful of coins and a barrel of powder.”

“So you chose him,” she said. “Understand that you also chose to stand on the other side of some doors when they close.”

She looked away briefly, toward the inner hall. Voices drifted from within, female and low.

“They groom you,” she said. “I can see it. Ramayyan marks your uses. The Maharaja tests your judgment. Padmini warms your feet at her hearth so your loyalty tastes local. They will make you a general of horse if you do not die first. Men like you look good in stories when the scribes write of brave charges.”

She met my eyes again.

“You will be offered many things,” she said. “Land. Honour. A place in their tales. Perhaps even a wife from some house that can make you feel rooted here.”

She shrugged slightly.

“Not from mine.”

The words were light. The tone was not.

“Men like you rarely have to ask,” she added. “The world falls over itself to give them offers. I state my position early.”

She rose then, smoothing her sari.

“Come,” she said. “The others will want to see that Padmini has not brought a complete fool into our courtyard. You will watch the ceremony, eat our food, listen to old women argue about dowries and young men boast about boats. Then you will go back to the Maharaja and tell him Velinadu smiled at you. Tell him also that we are still watching.”

She turned to go, then paused and looked over her shoulder.

“And Nagoji,” she said. “The next time you ride your horses on that wet sand, remember that when they trample, they do so on land that belongs to more than one king. Every hoofprint has a name beneath it. Learn those names.”

Then she was gone, swallowed by the shade of the inner hall, jasmine leaving a faint trail in the air.

Soft footsteps sounded behind me. Padmini Amma stepped back onto the verandah from the direction of the inner rooms and let out a slow breath.

“You did not disgrace yourself,” she said.

“I am not sure she agrees,” I said.

“She does not have to,” Padmini said. “Her place in this story is not to approve. It is to remind men like you and the Maharaja that the land remembers longer than crowns do.”

In the distance, drums began again, a steady heartbeat rhythm. As we rose to follow, the ground under my bare feet took on new weight.

In Goa, I had fought men who believed God and gunpowder gave them the right to rule. In Velinadu, I had met a woman who believed lineage and land gave her the right to refuse.

Between those two certainties, my own place felt precarious.

Yet there was a strange comfort in that.

If storms had taught me anything, it was that balance is not found on flat, solid ground. It is found on the shifting deck, in the moment between one wave and the next, when you decide whether to fall or to ride.

Revathi Bayi had made her position clear.

Later, when the hall had emptied and Padmini was talking quietly with house elders, a servant found me near the outer steps.

“The Velinadu lady asks if your feet remember her verandah,” he said.

She was waiting where I had first seen her, coins at her throat dimmer in the lamplight, the night air cooler on the stone.

“You heard many words today,” she said without preamble. “Tell me one thing you learned.”

“That treaties are nets,” I said. “And that Velinadu does not let anyone else hold the rope.”

The corner of her mouth twitched.

“Not bad,” she said. “And what did you learn about yourself?”

I hesitated.

“That I am still a man the sea has not decided to keep,” I said. “And that I stand on land that can throw me off if I forget whose it is.”

Her gaze flicked to the long white scar on my forearm, a souvenir of Goa.

“That one?” she asked. “Sea or fort?”

“Dungeon,” I said. “A Portuguese man with time and tools.”

Her hand lifted, almost of its own accord, stopping a finger's breadth from the mark.

“Travancore has its own tools,” she said softly. “Do not give us reason to use them.”

She let her hand drop.

“Go,” she added. “Padmini will think I am trying to steal her new toy.”

The question of where I would stand when the king's wishes scraped against the houses of this coast remained unanswered.

For now, I followed Padmini into the hall, where incense curled, drums spoke, and old Velinadu women weighed the future in words sharper than blades.
