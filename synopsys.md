# Horse of the Monsoon – Synopsis

## Book I: Chains and Surf

Nagoji Sawant, a thirty year old Maratha cavalry officer from near present day Nashik, is broken in Portuguese hands, survives a slave ship and a storm he is utterly unprepared for, and is carried into Travancore as valuable wreckage in **1735**. By the end of the book he has met the king and diwan, poised to enter a kingdom on the brink of internal transformation.

- **Chapter 1: Dungeons of Goa**  
  Nagoji is interrogated and tortured in a Portuguese prison in Goa while Father Duarte watches, and we learn his Maratha cavalry past through the questions hurled at him.

- **Chapter 2: The Slave Ship South**  
  Chained in a crowded hold with younger comrade Keshavrao, Nagoji is loaded onto a Portuguese transport as monsoon weather darkens the Arabian Sea.

- **Chapter 3: The Choice in the Storm**  
  A violent storm tears the ship apart, chains snap, some prisoners drown bound while others scramble for freedom, and Nagoji fails to save Keshavrao before he is flung into black water.

- **Chapter 4: The Fishermen of the Pepper Coast**  
  Nagoji wakes on a Malabar beach, is debated over by local fishermen, and is claimed by Ibrahim Marakkar, who recognises the value of a cavalryman scarred by European war.

- **Chapter 5: Road to Travancore**  
  As he travels up the pepper coast, Nagoji registers the strangeness of Malabar, hears of Padmini Amma the estate holder and Revathi Bayi the sharp tongued princess, and glimpses Travancore’s coastal forts.

- **Chapter 6: The Coastal Hall**  
  In a campaign hall above the sea he meets King Marthanda Varma and Diwan Ramayyan, who question him about horses, guns and politics, leaving him unsure whether he is guest or weapon.

## Book II: Court of the Tiger

Nagoji learns the workings of Travancore’s court and countryside, discovers how much power Malabar women wield, falls into a dangerous attraction with Princess Revathi Bayi, and helps prepare a trap for the Dutch he has not yet seen.

- **Chapter 7: Horses in Wet Sand**  
  Ordered to train Travancore and Arcot cavalry in **1735**, Nagoji struggles until he adapts Deccan tactics to wet coastal ground and wins grudging respect from local horsemen.

- **Chapter 8: Padmini Amma's Estate**  
  Billeted on Padmini Amma’s matrilineal estate, he is startled by a woman who commands land, men and pepper revenue, and she explains how royal women like Revathi Bayi sit at the top of this order.

- **Chapter 9: Princess of Velinadu**  
  Introduced by Padmini Amma at a Velinadu gathering, Nagoji meets Revathi Bayi, spars with her over politics, feels an immediate pull, and is stung when she dismisses him as a man lending his sword to a king he barely understands.

- **Chapter 10: Lessons in Travancore**  
  Over the years **1736-1738**, Nagoji rides in the King's internal campaigns against the *Ettuveetil Pillamar* (Eight Houses). He sees how religion, landholding and army mesh, and how Ramayyan’s unseen hand links them to break feudal power.

- **Chapter 11: Dutch on the Horizon**  
  From coastal watch posts, Ibrahim brings reports of disciplined Dutch ships offshore under a hard drilling commander Nagoji never quite sees, and De Lannoy’s name is heard only as a rumour.

- **Chapter 12: Threads of Alliance**  
  In court, Nagoji watches Dutch envoys, chieftains, temple men, Padmini Amma and Revathi Bayi manoeuvre while Ramayyan quietly shapes the outcome, and he realises he is just one piece on a board that stretches to Batavia.

- **Chapter 13: The Eve of Colachel (1741)**  
  With Dutch fleets finally near after years of shadow war, Nagoji readies his veteran cavalry. Padmini Amma secures her estates, Revathi Bayi moves inside the palace to manage aristocratic fears, and the king and diwan tighten their trap.

## Book III: After the Dutch

The battle of Colachel shatters Dutch power, introduces De Lannoy as a prisoner turned adviser, and forces Nagoji to face both the possibilities of this new Travancore army and the pull of the distant Maratha world.

- **Chapter 14: The Charge at Colachel**  
  From his saddle Nagoji rides through smoke and sand as Travancore musketeers and horse break Dutch squares, catching only brief glimpses of a foreign officer commanding with discipline before the line collapses.

- **Chapter 15: Prisoners of a New King**  
  Dutch prisoners are screened, De Lannoy is interrogated by Marthanda Varma and Ramayyan in a scene that echoes Nagoji’s own first questioning, and he accepts Travancore service while Nagoji feels his uniqueness fade.

- **Chapter 16: Building a New Army**  
  Time jumps forward as De Lannoy reshapes forts and infantry drills, Nagoji rebuilds cavalry doctrine, Ramayyan keeps everything aligned with the crown, and Padmini Amma negotiates how her estate survives within this tighter military net.

- **Chapter 17: Dutch Come Bowing**  
  Dutch envoys return to court seeking trade and recognition, forced to pay for rights they once took by force, while De Lannoy stands between old allegiance and new oath and Ramayyan tells Nagoji to remember every detail.

- **Chapter 18: Shadows of the Deccan**  
  Letters and rumours from the Maratha heartland, including hints about Keshavrao and old sardars, stir Nagoji’s sense of unfinished duty, and a private talk with the king makes clear he will always be respected yet never entirely trusted.

- **Chapter 19: Ramayyan's Ledger**  
  Nagoji discovers that Ramayyan keeps files on everyone, including him, and their quiet argument about control, loyalty and necessity ends with the diwan urging him to decide what story he wants the wider world to hear about Travancore.

## Book IV: Teeth of the Tiger

Nagoji chooses to stay in Travancore, rises to command cavalry under De Lannoy, faces internal and external crises that force him to hurt people he loves, breaks an old border house tied to Revathi, and ends as an older general who knows exactly what his kingdom has cost.

- **Chapter 20: Command of the Marches**  
  When Marthanda Varma offers land and a permanent cavalry command on the northern frontier, Nagoji accepts, binding himself openly to Travancore and complicating his ties to Padmini Amma and to Revathi Bayi.

- **Chapter 21: First Campaign for the Tiger**  
  He leads his first campaign against a Dutch backed chief, balancing Deccan style raids with De Lannoy’s demand for coordination, while fighting near Padmini Amma’s estates and risking war on her soil.

- **Chapter 22: Under De Lannoy's Standard**  
  Back from campaign, Nagoji and De Lannoy work as a real partnership shaping cavalry and fort design, drawing resentment as two powerful outsiders while Ramayyan alternately shields and uses them.

- **Chapter 23: Ramayyan's Test**  
  Ramayyan engineers a situation where Nagoji could shift his loyalty back toward the Maratha world or protect Travancore, and Nagoji chooses Travancore at real personal cost, which confirms for Revathi Bayi that he stands with the king’s project.

- **Chapter 24: Fire in the Pepper Fields**  
  Dutch backed raiders and internal revolt strike at once, Nagoji rides hard between forts and estates, and he orders a scorched strip of Padmini Amma's pepper land to deny cover to enemies, saving the kingdom but carving a black wound through her fields and prompting Revathi’s final refusal to tie Velinadu’s line to his crowded ledger of oaths.

- **Chapter 25: The Elayadathu Claim**  
  As Mysore, the Nizam and European companies circle, the strategic logic of Marthanda Varma's consolidation becomes brutal: when Kottarakkara's chief dies in confinement, Princess Savitri of Elayadathu Swaroopam, Revathi's kinswoman, claims succession, the king refuses, she flees to Dutch support, and a short, bitter war ends with her exile to Cochin. Years later Nagoji, now grey and still on the walls he helped defend, thinks of Savitri’s distant garden and of Revathi choosing to remember what the kingdom cost, as the monsoon falls on a state built from broken houses.
