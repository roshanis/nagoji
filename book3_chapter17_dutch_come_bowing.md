# Book III, Chapter 17: Dutch Come Bowing

The second time Dutchmen entered the coastal hall, they smelled less of salt and more of caution.

It had been some time since Colachel.

Long enough for new walls to rise, for fresh muskets to find their way into Travancore hands, for stories of the broken company square to spread along the Malabar coast and into places where men in powdered wigs frowned over them.

Long enough for Batavia to send new instructions.

We heard of the envoys before we saw them.

In the markets, Marakkar traders spoke of Dutch factors counting coins more carefully, of ship captains who now asked twice before pressing a local chief too hard. Yusuf Marakkar in particular always seemed to know a little more than he said, his comments about company moods shaped like bait. In the backwaters, boatmen reported quieter company landings, fewer musket armed patrols. In the temples, priests heard confessions from men who had once taken Dutch bribes and now feared they had backed the wrong god.

“They will come,” Ramayyan said one morning, tapping a palm leaf with his stylus. “Not with drums, this time. With papers.”

He was right.

When the envoys arrived, their coats were more subdued than those of the men who had strutted here before the battle. Their lace was less ostentatious, their hats held more humbly. Behind them walked scribes with thicker bundles, as if they hoped paper could balance scales that guns had tipped.

Lannoy stood at the edge of the hall as they entered.

He wore a simple cotton coat over his European shirt, his hair tied back as always. A sword hung at his side, not the one he had surrendered at Colachel, but a similar blade, its hilt now wrapped in local cloth.

The Dutch envoys saw him and faltered.

For a heartbeat, their careful expressions cracked. Then they recovered, faces smoothing.

“Captain De Lannoy,” the senior envoy said in Dutch, bowing slightly. “We were told...”

He trailed off. What had they been told That he was dead That he was rotting in some dungeon That he had been shipped off to another colony

Their eyes took in the sword at his side, the way Travancore guards stood near him without hostility, the way Ramayyan's gaze flicked to him with approval rather than suspicion.

“You were told many things,” Lannoy replied in the same language. “Some of them were true.”

He stepped back, ceding the centre of the hall, making it clear that he was not the one they had to address.

Marthanda Varma sat on his platform as before, bare feet on the mat, spear within reach. If he felt any satisfaction at the sight of Dutchmen forced to greet one of their own as a subordinate in his court, he did not show it beyond the smallest narrowing of the eyes.

“Maharaja,” the envoy said in careful Portuguese, then through a Malayalam interpreter, “the Honourable Dutch East India Company conveys its formal regrets for the unfortunate conflict at Colachel and wishes to restore relations based on mutual advantage.”

“Regrets,” Marthanda Varma repeated. “You regret that your men died when they tried to land on my shore. Do you regret sending them”

The envoy spread his hands in that same well practised manner that men of his trade seemed to learn along with their letters.

“Circumstances,” he said, “were misjudged. We underestimated the strength and resolve of Travancore. We have been instructed to correct this error.”

“By whose instruction?” Ramayyan asked softly.

“By the Governor General and Council at Batavia,” the envoy said. “And by our superiors in the chambers that oversee company trade in Europe.”

“So far from this coast,” Padmini murmured from her place. “Yet their decisions wash up here like driftwood.”

“They now recognise,” the envoy continued, “that trying to force terms upon Travancore is neither profitable nor prudent. They propose a treaty.”

He gestured, and a scribe stepped forward with a folded document.

Ramayyan did not move to take it. Instead, he signalled to one of his own scribes, who came forward with an empty palm leaf and stylus.

“Read,” Ramayyan said.

The scribe read aloud in Portuguese, the interpreter trailing in Malayalam. Terms unrolled in the air.

Recognition of Travancore's sovereignty over its present territories. Agreement not to build new forts or expand existing ones without consultation. Guarantees of pepper and other spices to the company at agreed prices. Company ships allowed to use certain anchorages under Travancore oversight. Mutual commitment to act against “pirates and raiders” who threatened trade.

“Who decides who is a pirate?” Revathi asked from where she sat beside Padmini. “In Velinadu, when we killed company men who broke their word, you called us pirates.”

The envoy's jaw tightened.

“We propose a joint commission,” he said. “Representatives from your court and ours. They will determine such matters.”

Ramayyan's stylus scratched a note.

“You wish us to share the work of deciding whether men who threaten your profits are criminals,” he said. “Interesting.”

There were other clauses.

Company access to certain forests for timber. Provisions for protection of company factors in Travancore towns. An article expressing “friendship and alliance” in the event of other European power encroachment.

Lannoy's face remained impassive, but I saw one corner of his mouth twitch at that.

“You would like us to fight your rivals at your side,” Marthanda Varma said. “After you tried to land soldiers on my beach without permission.”

“We would like stability,” the envoy said. “Your kingdom has proven that it can resist outsiders. We prefer to be your trading partners rather than your enemies.”

“Partners,” the king said. “Partners who once tried to break my spine.”

There was a murmur in the hall.

“You offer recognition,” Ramayyan said, tapping the air with his stylus. “You offer trade. You offer to pay for pepper instead of taking it. In return, you wish our help in keeping other company rivals away, and our assurance that we will not shut you out entirely.”

“Yes,” the envoy said.

“And what do you offer,” Revathi asked, “for the men who died at Colachel and in Velinadu and in the smaller towns your patrols burned”

The envoy hesitated.

"We cannot bring back the dead," he said. "We can only ensure that more do not die in similar misunderstandings."

The envoy paused, and something flickered behind his careful expression.

"We are also aware," he added, his tone shifting to something almost casual, "that not all houses on this coast share the Maharaja's... enthusiasm for consolidation. There are those who remember older arrangements. Older claims."

He did not look at anyone in particular. He did not need to.

Ramayyan's stylus stopped moving. Marthanda Varma's eyes narrowed by a fraction. Revathi's hand, resting on her knee, curled into a loose fist.

"If the company wished," the envoy continued, "we could simply wait. Support those who feel aggrieved. Let internal divisions do what external force could not."

The words hung in the air like smoke after a musket shot.

"You could," the king said softly. "You will find the cost higher than you expect."

"Perhaps," the envoy said. "Or perhaps not. We have learned patience."

The threat was clear. Somewhere, someone the Dutch could use was waiting. A claim. A grievance. A kinswoman with long memories.

I thought of the name I had seen in Ramayyan's ledger. Elayadathu. The entry marked HIGH.

"Misunderstandings," Padmini said under her breath, her voice harder than before. "A pretty word for greed."

Marthanda Varma sat very still for a long moment.

When he spoke, his voice was calm.

“You come here,” he said, “because you have learned that your guns cannot keep us from killing your men if you land them without leave. You have learned that this small strip of coast is not as easy to bully as some others. You have learned that some of our houses, like Velinadu and Padmini's line, will not sign papers that erase their names. So you bring different papers. Clever. I approve of cleverness. It makes life interesting.”

The envoy opened his mouth to speak. The king lifted a hand.

“Do not mistake my approval for weakness,” he said. “We will sign treaties that benefit us. We will not sign away our children's choices. If you wish pepper, you will pay. If you wish safe anchorage, you will obey our rules. If you wish warriors, you will not have them. This army is not for hire.”

Ramayyan's stylus paused over his leaf. He glanced at the king, then wrote something with quick strokes.

“As for Captain De Lannoy,” Marthanda Varma went on, “he is now my officer. He will not return to your service. If your company has complaints about that, they may address them to me, not to him.”

The envoy's throat worked.

“We had hoped,” he began, “that he might be returned as part of an exchange...”

“You had hoped many things,” the king said. “Hopes are not terms.”

Lannoy stood very straight, eyes fixed somewhere past the envoys' shoulders.

“If you wish to send him letters,” Ramayyan said, a hint of something like kindness in his tone, “we will read them first. If they are respectful, we will let him see them. If they instruct him to betray his new oath, we will burn them without troubling him.”

The younger Dutchman at the envoy's side looked as if he might choke. The older man kept his features composed through will alone.

“We will convey your requirements to Batavia,” he said. “In the meantime, may we proceed to sign the articles that concern trade and recognition”

“We will draft our own version,” Ramayyan said. “Your paper will be weighed against it. When both sides match, we will sign.”

“How long will this take?” the envoy asked.

“As long as needed,” Ramayyan replied. “We have learned to be patient. Battles take hours. Good treaties take months.”

After the formal session ended, the hall thinned.

Chiefs drifted away, muttering about clauses, about how much pepper would now be counted in new ways. Priests whispered that the company was finally acknowledging what the gods had known: that Travancore would not be an easy feast.

Lannoy stood near a pillar, hands clasped behind his back, watching as his old compatriots were escorted out.

The senior envoy paused beside him.

“You seem healthy,” he said in Dutch. “Better than many expected.”

“I have work,” Lannoy said. “Men here do not waste tools.”

“You have chosen the wrong side,” the envoy murmured. “The company does not forget those who betray it.”

“It forgets those who die for it,” Lannoy replied quietly. “I prefer to be remembered by someone closer than Amsterdam.”

The envoy's jaw tightened.

“They call you traitor in Batavia,” he said.

“They can call me what they like,” Lannoy said. “Here, they call me kapitan. That is enough.”

After the Dutch had gone, I found Revathi on the verandah outside, looking toward the sea.

“Satisfied?” I asked.

She made a noncommittal sound.

“They bowed,” she said. “That is something. They put quills where they once put muskets. Also something. But I have seen enough paper to know that men who sign today can tear tomorrow.”

“Ram will keep copies,” I said.

“Paper burns,” she said. “Land remembers.”

Padmini joined us, her stick ticking against the floor.

“Today, we have made them pay to do what they once did for free,” she said. “That is a small victory.”

“Small victories add up,” I said.

“So do small betrayals,” Revathi replied.

She looked at me.

“Remember this, Nagoji Sawant,” she said. “When people speak of Colachel in years to come, they will talk of the day Dutchmen fell before Travancore guns and horse. Few will talk of the quiet days afterward, when men in coats tried to rebuild their power with ink. Those days matter too.”

“I will remember,” I said.

“Good,” she said. “Because one day, when you are old and some young rider asks you how we kept this coast from becoming another Goa, you must tell him about both. The charge and the papers. The dead on the sand and the men who bowed here today.”

Her words settled into me like stones in a pouch.

Later, writing by lamplight, I noted the date, the names, the key terms. Not because I trusted my memory, but because I had learned from watching Ramayyan that paper, in the right hands, could be a weapon.

The Dutch had come bowing.

It did not mean they had forgotten how to bite.

But the shape of their teeth had changed.

And we had been there to see it.
