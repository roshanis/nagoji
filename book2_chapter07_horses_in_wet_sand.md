# Book II, Chapter 7: Horses in Wet Sand

The first time I tried to make Arcot horses run in Malabar sand, they laughed at me.

Not with their mouths. Horses do not waste breath on that. They laughed with every sideways step, every planted hoof that refused to drive, every rolling eye that said what the riders did not dare speak aloud.

You do not belong here, Deccan man.

The strip of beach the king had given me was narrow, caught between the rise of a low bluff and the tug of the Arabian Sea. At high tide the waves gnawed at it until only a sliver remained. At low tide it opened into a broader, packed plain of damp sand that looked inviting to a cavalryman who had never tried to stop a charge on such footing.

The sun had only just cleared the line of palms when the Arcot troop arrived, lances gleaming, turbans wrapped high. Their commander, a lean man with a hawk nose and a scar that puckered his left cheek, saluted with his spear butt to his chest.

“Raza Khan, at your service,” he said in a Hindustani that carried the singsong of the Carnatic. “The Nawab sends his horse as promised. We have fought for Arcot and for your king before. We know how to ride.”

Behind him the men sat straight in their saddles, horses tossing their heads, bits clinking. They looked confident. Too confident.

On the bluff above, a line of Maravar horsemen watched, their lighter mounts shifting impatiently. They wore no uniforms, only white mundus hitched for riding and short jackets, but each man carried himself with the easy assurance of one whose family had held swords for generations. Their commander, a broad shouldered fellow named Ponnam Pandya Deven, had already ridden with me along the inland tracks. He said little, but his eyes missed nothing.

Closer to the bluff, under the shade of a cloth awning, two figures sat on low stools. Distance and the haze rising off the warming sand made them look small, but I knew them. Marthanda Varma, bare headed, a simple cloth over his shoulder. Ramayyan beside him, palm leaves in his lap, stylus ready, as if he meant to take notes on horses as much as on men.

The king had told me, in that coastal hall, to show him something he had not already imagined.

At the time, with the memory of chains still raw on my skin, the challenge had felt almost like grace. Now, faced with wet sand and two sets of riders who trusted their own ways more than mine, it sat on me like a weight.

“We begin with the simple release,” I said to Raza Khan and Ponnam Pandya Deven. “Ride to the water’s edge. Turn. Ride back. Do not let the hoof slide.”

Raza Khan frowned, his hand resting on his pommel.

“We did not ride from Arcot to school our mounts like children on their first pony,” he said. “My men ride to break lines, not to dance with crabs.”

“Your men ride on hard earth,” I said. “Here the ground lies to you. It looks firm, but it drinks the hoof. If you charge a Dutch square and your horse stumbles on the turn, you are not a soldier, you are a target.”

The Arcot rider’s jaw tightened. He glanced up at the bluff, where the King watched. He did not want to be seen arguing with the stranger Marthanda Varma had set over him.

“One pass,” he said. “To show you there is no magic in sand.”

Ponnam Pandya Deven said nothing, but a faint smile touched his lips as he signaled his Maravar.

The first pass was not a disaster, but it was ugly.

I watched the Arcot horses hit the wetter sand. They were heavy beasts, bred for the dry plains of the Carnatic. When they tried to turn, their weight carried them deep. Hooves sucked into the slurry. Legs flailed. Riders jerked reins to keep their seats, breaking the proud rhythm of the charge.

The Maravar fared better. Their ponies were smaller, stepping lightly where the larger horses sank. They spun and darted, grinning at the southerners’ clumsiness.

“See?” I called out, riding my own mount between them. “The earth here judges weight. It punishes force.”

Ponnam Pandya Deven brought his horse alongside mine as the line wheeled back toward firmer ground.

“This earth has judged hooves longer than you have ridden, Deccan man,” he said quietly. “We learned that under other kings.”

“Then teach your Arcot friends,” I said. “Today they followed me into the bog. Tomorrow they follow you around it.”

His eye flicked to Raza Khan, still cursing at his mount, then back to me.

“We will see whose tricks the Dutch remember,” he said.

Raza Khan had wrestled his horse back to firm ground. He looked furious, shaking sand from his stirrup.

“It is a bog,” he spat. “No cavalry can fight here.”

“The Dutch will be here,” I said. “If you cannot fight where they stand, why did you take the King’s coin?”

He glared at me, but the anger was cooled by the shame of the stumble.

“Again,” I said. “But this time, do not fight the ground. Let the horse find the bottom before you ask for the turn. You must ride with the sand, not against it.”

We spent the morning in that slurry.

I essentially stripped the pageantry from them. No formations. No lances. Just men sweating in the heat, learning that the Malabar coast did not care about their lineage. I made them mix their lines, one heavy Arcot horse, one light Maravar pony.

“Watch him,” I told an Arcot rider whose beast was lathered and trembling. I pointed to a Maravar youth whose pony stood calm. “He does not force the step. He waits for the sand to hold him.”

The sun climbed. The heat turned the air liquid.

“This is not war,” Raza Khan grumbled as we paused for water. “This is labor.”

“It is the only war that matters today,” I said. “The Dutch carry muskets that fire in volleys. Precise. Mechanical. If you charge them straight, they will break you. You must come at them like the tide, fast, from the angle they do not expect, and gone before they can reload.”

Raza Khan wiped his face. “To ride like the tide, one must first not drown in the sand.”

“Exactly.”

I drew a line in the wet earth with a piece of driftwood.

“The Dutch line,” I said.

I drew two curves coming from the flanks.

“Us. We do not hit them. We bait them. We ride close, close enough to make them level their muskets. Then we turn. If we slip then, we die. If we turn true, they fire at ghosts, and while they reload, we take them with the saber.”

Raza Khan looked at the crude map.

“It is a gamble,” he said. “To ride into the teeth of the gun and turn away.”

“It is better than riding into the teeth and staying there,” I said.

“If the horses hold,” he murmured.

“Make them hold.”

We went back to the work. And slowly, agonizingly, the rhythm changed. The Arcot horses stopped fighting the ground. The riders stopped jerking the reins. They began to feel the heavy, sucking pause of the sand and ride through it.

I felt it in my body before I saw it. The way the horses moved under their riders, the subtle shift from resistance to acceptance. Men began to trust that their mounts would not vanish under them at every turn. Horses began to trust that their riders would not ask for impossible strides.

On the bluff, the awning's edge moved again. The king rose, stretching his legs. He spoke to Ramayyan in words I could not catch. The diwan inclined his head and wrote a few final marks on his palm leaves.

When the run ended I rode up the slope to them, sweat drying on my skin, sand clinging to my legs.

Marthanda Varma watched the riders regroup below, tiny figures against the shining strip of water.

“You make them move like fish,” he said, without preamble. “Not like bulls.”

“Fish do not charge muskets,” I said. “But yes. If your enemies expect bulls, better to be something else.”

He nodded slowly.

“They are not yet ready,” he said. “But they are less foolish than they were at sunrise.”

Ramayyan looked up from his palm leaves.

“They obeyed you,” he said. “Even when their pride bucked harder than their horses.”

“They obeyed the king's order,” I said. “I am only the voice today.”

“Voices matter,” Ramayyan said. “Especially when the sea is loud.”

The king's gaze shifted to the horizon, where a line of darker blue hinted at deeper water.

“The Dutch think these sands belong to them,” he said softly. “They think their boots and bayonets make them owners. Show me, Nagoji Sawant, that horses can disagree.”

I bowed my head once.

“I will try,” I said.

As I rode back down toward the strip of wet sand where Arcot and Maravar horsemen waited, catching their breath, I felt a strange mixture in my chest.

Fear, yes. Responsibility, sharp as any spear point. But also something I had not felt since before Goa, before the dungeon, before the storm.

Anticipation.

On Deccan soil I had thought I knew the limits of what a horse could do against a gun. Here, with the sea muttering at my back and wet sand underfoot, those limits shifted.

Storms did not ask permission. Perhaps horses, taught well, did not either.
