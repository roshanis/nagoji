# Book II, Chapter 7: Horses in Wet Sand

The first time I tried to make Arcot horses run in Malabar sand, they laughed at me.

Not with their mouths. Horses do not waste breath on that. They laughed with every sideways step, every planted hoof that refused to drive, every rolling eye that said what the riders did not dare speak aloud.

You do not belong here, Deccan man.

The strip of beach the king had given me was narrow, caught between the rise of a low bluff and the tug of the Arabian Sea. At high tide the waves gnawed at it until only a sliver remained. At low tide it opened into a broader, packed plain of damp sand that looked inviting to a cavalryman who had never tried to stop a charge on such footing.

The sun had only just cleared the line of palms when the Arcot troop arrived, lances gleaming, turbans wrapped high. Their commander, a lean man with a hawk nose and a scar that puckered his left cheek, saluted with his spear butt to his chest.

“Raza Khan, at your service,” he said in a Hindustani that carried the singsong of the Carnatic. “The Nawab sends his horse as promised. We have fought for Arcot and for your king before. We know how to ride.”

Behind him the men sat straight in their saddles, horses tossing their heads, bits clinking. They looked confident. Too confident.

On the bluff above, a line of Nair horsemen watched, their lighter mounts shifting impatiently. They wore no uniforms, only white mundus hitched for riding and short jackets, but each man carried himself with the easy assurance of one whose family had held swords for generations. Their captain, a broad shouldered fellow named Kumaran, had already ridden with me along the inland tracks. He said little, but his eyes missed nothing.

Closer to the bluff, under the shade of a cloth awning, two figures sat on low stools. Distance and the haze rising off the warming sand made them look small, but I knew them. Marthanda Varma, bare headed, a simple cloth over his shoulder. Ramayyan beside him, palm leaves in his lap, stylus ready, as if he meant to take notes on horses as much as on men.

The king had told me, in that coastal hall, to show him something he had not already imagined.

At the time, with the memory of chains still raw on my skin, the challenge had felt almost like grace. Now, faced with wet sand and two sets of riders who trusted their own ways more than mine, it felt like a weight around my neck.

“We begin with movement,” I said to Raza Khan and Kumaran, pitching my voice so it carried without shouting. “Not charges. Not bravery. Movement. Your horses must learn how this sand speaks under their hooves.”

Raza Khan frowned.

“We did not ride from Arcot to walk our mounts like village donkeys,” he said. “My men know their trade.”

“Your men know their trade on dry ground,” I said. “Here the ground lies. It looks firm. It sucks at the hoof. It tricks the eye. I will not break horses because you think trotting is beneath you.”

The Arcot rider's jaw tightened. His eyes flicked toward the awning on the bluff. He did not want to be seen arguing with the man the king had put in charge of this exercise. He also did not like being spoken to as if he were a recruit.

“We will humour you,” he said at last. “For a while.”

Kumaran said nothing, but one corner of his mouth twitched.

We started with simple lines.

I had the Arcot horsemen walk their animals along the damp strip close to the water, then turn sharply inland and back again, tightening the circle each time. The first turns went badly. Horses slipped, hooves skidding on the slick surface where wave and sand met. Riders grabbed manes and saddles to stay upright, curses mixing with the crash of the surf.

“Shorten your reins,” I called. “Give them their heads on the straight, gather them before the turn. Feel when the sand shifts.”

Some listened. Some did not. Those who did found that their mounts wobbled less, though sweat already darkened the arcs behind their girths.

The Nair horsemen watched for a time, amused. Their own animals were smaller and lighter, bred for this coast. When I signalled, Kumaran brought them down from the bluff.

“Your turn,” I said.

They moved with less drama. Their horses picked their way along the line of foam, ears twitching, tails flicking. When they turned inland they sank a little, but not as deeply. They had walked these sands while Arcot mounts were still learning the taste of Malabar wind.

“Good,” I said. “Now together.”

Raza Khan's brows rose.

“Together?”

“Your horses will have to move beside each other when the Dutch fire,” I said. “Better they learn now what it feels like to share bad footing.”

The first attempt at combined movement was chaos.

Arcot horses shied at the unfamiliar Nair mounts. Nair horses, offended by snorting outsiders at their flanks, snapped and sidestepped. Two animals tangled. A rider went down in the sand with a curse and rolled clear just before a hoof came down where his head had been.

From the bluff, someone laughed. The sound carried poorly, but my pride heard it clear enough.

I rode my own horse, a stocky Travancore gelding still suspicious of me, between the lines and brought them to a halt.

“Again,” I said.

“The sand is the problem,” one of the Arcot men muttered. “On firm ground...”

“On firm ground the Dutch will cut you down as they did others before you,” I said. “They drill for flat fields. They train for enemies who charge like they do, in straight lines. We will not give them that. We will give them this.”

I slapped my palm against the damp sand with a wet smack.

“Learn to move here, and their neat squares will become traps for themselves.”

It was partly bravado. In truth, I was still feeling my way toward what this place could offer. But soldiers respond to confidence as much as to logic. You give them a shape to believe in, and their bodies will follow.

We tried again.

This time I broke them into smaller groups, pairs and fours, interleaving Arcot and Nair riders. I had them move not in long lines but in staggered patterns, one pair by the water, another inland, crossing paths at angles I knew would confuse men used to straight charges and fixed drills.

The sand continued to steal speed. Hooves dug in and slid. Horses blew hard, sides heaving. Yet slowly, grudgingly, a kind of rhythm emerged. Men began to feel when they could ask for a burst of pace and when they had to sit deeper and gather their animals.

The sun climbed. Heat rose off the sand in waves. The sea kept up its endless mutter, indifferent.

When a natural pause came, I raised my hand.

“Water,” I called. “For horses and men. Then we see what we have learned.”

As the riders led their mounts to buckets and troughs, Kumaran guided his horse over to mine.

“You ask hill men to learn the sea,” he said quietly. “You ask coastal men to trust hill men with their lives.”

“And you think this is foolish,” I said.

He considered that, head tilted toward the bluff where the king and Ramayyan sat.

“I think foolishness depends on who stands behind you,” he said. “When the Maharaja watches, strange plans become courage.”

I smiled despite the sweat on my face.

“Then let us be very courageous today.”

After the break I laid out a simple pattern in the sand with a stick. A rectangle, not too wide, marked at the corners with driftwood stakes.

“Imagine the Dutch,” I said, pointing to the longer sides. “Their musketeers stand here, shoulder to shoulder, bayonets at the ready. Their officers shout in a language most of you do not speak. Their drums beat time. They wait for you to come at them in a clean line.”

I drew two crooked arrows along the shorter sides.

“We do not oblige them,” I said. “We come from here. And here. We feint on one side, then vanish before the volley. They turn. They adjust. In that moment, when their bodies are moving but their minds have not caught up, we strike from somewhere else.”

Raza Khan studied the drawing.

“Too many moving parts,” he said. “Men will forget who feints and who strikes.”

“Then we keep it small,” I said. “Pairs. Quads. Each group with one job. Your men like to ride straight and show their skill. Let them show it here, where the sand punishes mistakes before the Dutch do.”

He snorted, but there was less heat in it now.

“We try it once,” he said. “If my horses break legs in your wet trap, I will send the bill to your Peshwa.”

“He will tell you I cannot pay,” I said. “I am already in debt to too many ghosts.”

We formed them up.

On the bluff, the awning’s edge stirred in a light breeze. I could not see Marthanda Varma's face clearly, but I could feel his attention like a hand on the back of my neck. Ramayyan sat still, stylus poised. He watched not just the horses but the men, measuring who chafed, who adapted, who resented my voice and who already began to listen for it in the chaos.

The first run through the pattern was clumsy.

One pair of Nair riders came in too fast on the feint, forcing the Arcot group meant to strike to check their pace. Hooves churned up sprays of sand. The line that was supposed to be a neat rectangle became a drunken shape more suited to a scribbling child than a war plan.

I pulled them back, breath coming in short bursts that were as much frustration as effort.

“Again,” I said.

“They will not stand like this in real battle,” one Arcot rider muttered. “The Dutch will fire, men will fall, there will be smoke...”

“Then it is better you learn to adjust to a pattern now, before smoke and blood blind you,” I said. “If you cannot remember which way to turn when the sand is clean, you will not remember when it is wet with men.”

We ran it again. And again.

By the fourth attempt something clicked.

The feinting pair came in at a more measured pace, just close enough to be plausible, just far enough that their horses did not bury themselves in the softest patches. The striking group held back, then drove in at an angle the feint had opened, hooves pounding the firmer strip near the water. For a brief, satisfying moment the shape in the sand matched the shape in my head.

I felt it in my body before I saw it. The way the horses moved under their riders, the subtle shift from resistance to acceptance. Men began to trust that their mounts would not vanish under them at every turn. Horses began to trust that their riders would not ask for impossible strides.

On the bluff, the awning's edge moved again. The king rose, stretching his legs. He said something to Ramayyan that I could not hear. The diwan inclined his head and wrote a few final marks on his palm leaves.

When the run ended I rode up the slope to them, sweat drying on my skin, sand clinging to my legs.

Marthanda Varma watched the riders regroup below, tiny figures against the shining strip of water.

“You make them move like fish,” he said, without preamble. “Not like bulls.”

“Fish do not charge muskets,” I said. “But yes. If your enemies expect bulls, better to be something else.”

He nodded slowly.

“They are not yet ready,” he said. “But they are less foolish than they were at sunrise.”

Ramayyan looked up from his palm leaves.

“They obeyed you,” he said. “Even when their pride bucked harder than their horses.”

“They obeyed the king's order,” I said. “I am only the voice today.”

“Voices matter,” Ramayyan said. “Especially when the sea is loud.”

The king's gaze shifted to the horizon, where a line of darker blue hinted at deeper water.

“The Dutch think these sands belong to them,” he said softly. “They think their boots and bayonets make them owners. Show me, Nagoji Sawant, that horses can disagree.”

I bowed my head once.

“I will try,” I said.

As I rode back down toward the strip of wet sand where Arcot and Nair horsemen waited, catching their breath, I felt a strange mixture in my chest.

Fear, yes. Responsibility, sharp as any spear point. But also something I had not felt since before Goa, before the dungeon, before the storm.

Anticipation.

On Deccan soil I had thought I knew the limits of what a horse could do against a gun. Here, with the sea muttering at my back and wet sand underfoot, those limits shifted.

Storms did not ask permission. Perhaps horses, taught well, did not either.
