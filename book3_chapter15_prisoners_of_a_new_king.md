# Book III, Chapter 15: Prisoners of a New King

By midday, the beach at Colachel looked less like a battlefield and more like a market that had been caught in a storm and left to sort itself.

Men moved in clusters, carrying stretchers, dragging cannon, piling muskets. Carts creaked under loads of powder and shot taken from Dutch stores. Marakkar men picked over bales, deciding which could be sold and which would feed fires. Nair captains shouted, trying to gather their people around the right banners.

In the midst of this, the Dutch prisoners sat.

They had been separated into groups and ringed by spear points. Some sat in sullen silence, staring at the sand. Others whispered together, eyes darting toward the sea as if hoping some miracle might lift them back to their ships. A few slumped, heads bowed, exhaustion and shock having taken them beyond fear for the moment.

The wounded had already been seen to, as far as our means allowed. Those who could be saved without bleeding our own healers dry lay under makeshift shelters of cloth and palm leaves. Those who could not had been sent to their gods with as much mercy as war allows.

Lannoy sat apart, still bound at the wrists, under the shade of a leaning palm.

A guard stood nearby, spear grounded, but not too close. There was something about the Dutch captain that made men keep a small distance, as if he carried a different weather around him.

“Ram wants him alive and thinking,” Kumaran said when I approached. “He told us not to bruise him more than necessary. That is not a usual order.”

“Ram sees books where others see bodies,” I said. “He will want to read this one.”

We moved from the beach back toward the coastal hall, following a file of prisoners escorted by Nair and Arcot men.

The Dutch walked with varying degrees of dignity.

Some kept their backs straight, maintaining a stiff, brittle pride. Others hunched, eyes on the ground, every flinch at a shout betraying the strain of trying to appear unafraid. Their boots sank into the sandy path. Their coats clung damply to their backs.

The villagers we passed watched in silence.

Some made small, satisfied sounds when they saw the blue and grey coats. Others spat in the dust as the column went by. One old woman lifted her chin and said something sharp in Malayalam that made the younger women around her nod grimly.

“She lost a son in a Portuguese raid,” Ibrahim murmured. “To her, all white coats look the same.”

Inside the hall, the air was cooler, but tension crackled like heat.

Marthanda Varma sat on his platform, spear within reach, bare feet crossed on the mat. Ramayyan sat at his side, palm leaves spread, stylus ready. Padmini Amma sat a little off to one side, stick across her lap, her face composed but her eyes bright. Revathi Bayi was not present; Velinadu had sent a lesser kinswoman instead, older and less inclined to speak.

The Dutch prisoners were brought in and made to sit in a line before the platform.

Lannoy was placed at the centre, still bound, but no longer ringed by spear points. Two guards stood behind him, far enough that they did not overshadow him, close enough that he could not forget them.

For a moment, no one spoke.

The only sounds were the faint creak of the hall's wooden beams and the distant murmur of the sea.

“You are the man they call Lannoy,” Marthanda Varma said finally, in Portuguese.

The name sat oddly in his mouth, the foreign sounds bending to his tongue. Lannoy looked up, surprised, then inclined his head.

“Eustachius De Lannoy,” he said. “Captain, in the service of the Honourable Dutch East India Company.”

The interpreter, who had come with the earlier envoys and now found himself translating his own countrymen's misfortunes, began to speak. Ramayyan lifted a hand.

“He understands you,” he said. “Save your breath for when we need you.”

Lannoy's gaze flicked to the diwan, then back to the king.

“You speak my language,” he said. “Better than I speak yours.”

“I have had many teachers,” Marthanda Varma said. “Some in halls, some in forts, some at the mouths of guns. Your company has been very generous with lessons.”

A ripple of wry amusement moved through the Travancore side of the hall.

“Yesterday,” the king went on, “your men stood on my sand and fired at my people. Today, you sit in my hall and drink my air. Tell me, Captain Lannoy, what did you think when you landed?”

Lannoy's face tightened slightly.

“I thought,” he said carefully, “that we would establish a position to protect company interests along this coast. We believed certain chiefs would support us, that your forces were untested against European drill. We underestimated you.”

“Underestimated,” Marthanda Varma repeated, tasting the word. “A polite way of saying you thought we would break as others did.”

Lannoy did not deny it.

“Our reports from other parts of this land,” he said, “spoke of kings who quarrel among themselves while we take their ports. Of armies that scatter when they hear our guns. We prepared for that.”

“And when you stepped into our sand?” Ramayyan asked.

“Your muskets were better placed,” Lannoy said. “Your cavalry moved differently. You used the ground. You did not run when our cannon fired.”

He glanced toward me.

“Your riders,” he said. “They came from where we did not expect. They did not stay to be pinned. It was... inconvenient.”

There was a flicker of dry humour under the last word, though his jaw remained tight.

“You fought well,” I said in his own language. “For a man whose boots kept sinking.”

He huffed that same almost laugh.

“Your sand cheats,” he said. “On our fields at home, the ground is honest.”

“Ground is ground,” I said. “It owes nothing to anyone.”

Marthanda Varma watched this exchange with interest.

“You see, Ram,” he said. “Even men who came to teach us find themselves learning instead.”

Ramayyan's stylus scratched.

“Captain,” the king said, turning back to Lannoy. “Your company will want you back. They will send letters. They will offer money, threaten war, whisper in the ears of faraway governors. They will call you a hero if you return and a traitor if you do not.”

Lannoy's eyes narrowed.

“You speak as if I have a choice,” he said. “I am your prisoner.”

“For now,” Marthanda Varma said. “Prisoner is one word. Guest is another. Servant is a third. Ally a fourth. Men change between them more often than they admit.”

The hall murmured at that.

I thought of Goa again, of chains that allowed no such words. The difference in tone here tasted like fresh water after dungeon drip.

“You would have me fight for you,” Lannoy said. “Against my own company.”

“I would have you fight for this land,” the king said. “You have already fought against it. You know both sides. That makes you useful.”

“And what of my men?” Lannoy asked, nodding toward the prisoners at his sides. “You cannot make them all your guests.”

“Some will be ransomed,” Ramayyan said. “Some exchanged. Some may choose to stay and work under our officers, if they value their lives more than a distant company's anger. We will not force anyone to betray their own conscience. But we will not pretend that the company sees their consciences as anything more than numbers.”

The interpreter shifted, uncomfortable.

“If I agree,” Lannoy said slowly, “what assurance do I have that you will not treat me as a slave The Portuguese have done such things.”

“We are not Portuguese,” Padmini Amma said sharply. “We do not need to break men to use them.”

“We do not need to chain our own tools,” Marthanda Varma said. “A sword works better when the hand that holds it trusts the arm that moves it. If you stay, you will serve under our laws. You will not command without question. You will not build forts where you wish. You will teach us what you know of your drills and your guns. In return, you will live, eat, train, and perhaps, in time, have a place that is more than a prisoner and less than a king.”

Lannoy was silent for a long moment.

The hall waited.

“You ask much,” he said at last.

“I offer more than the sea does,” the king said. “Or the rope.”

He did not have to elaborate. Everyone in that hall knew what fate often awaited captured officers in other wars.

Lannoy's gaze dropped to his bound hands.

When he raised it again, something had shifted.

“If I refuse?” he asked, though he already knew.

“Then we treat you as any dangerous prisoner,” Ramayyan said. “We keep you under guard. We use what information we can draw without breaking our own codes. We send word to your company and see what they offer in return. Your life will be small and watched.”

“And if I accept?”

“You will still be watched,” Ramayyan said. “But your life will not be small.”

The Dutch captain exhaled slowly.

“You expect me to turn my coat because I lost a battle,” he said.

“We expect you to recognise that the company you serve is not God,” Marthanda Varma said. “It is a machine. Machines eat men. You can choose to be one more piece ground in its gears, or you can choose to make use of what you know in a place that will, at least, remember your name with some respect.”

It was a clever appeal.

Not to honour, which might have made Lannoy bristle, but to pride and practicality.

Pride that his knowledge mattered. Practicality that his life might mean more than a line in a distant ledger.

He looked at me again, as if measuring a precedent.

“You were their prisoner,” he said. “You now wear this king's cloth.”

“The Portuguese were my jailers,” I said. “This king was my rescuer. The Dutch, until this morning, were simply another set of guns. What you choose now will decide which they become for you.”

Lannoy's mouth tightened, then relaxed.

“I will need time,” he said. “To consider.”

“You have till sunrise,” Ramayyan said. “The sea does not leave ships waiting longer than that, and neither can we.”

The king lifted his hand.

“Take him to the upper room,” he said. “Do not bind his feet. Bind his hands lightly. Give him food fit for a man who may become an officer. Let him sleep if he can. Ram, have someone who speaks his tongue keep him company. Not to persuade, only to answer questions.”

Guards moved to obey.

As they led Lannoy away, he turned once more toward the platform.

“If I stay,” he said, “my company will call me traitor.”

“Your company already wrote you off when they sent you to die on a beach for their pepper,” Marthanda Varma said. “Think about that.”

After the Dutch had been removed, the hall settled into its own breathing again.

Ramayyan turned to me.

“You see how different this is from Goa,” he said quietly. “There they broke you to make you nothing. Here we bend men to make them part of something.”

“You make it sound noble,” I said.

“It is not noble,” he said. “It is necessary. Nobility is for poets. We are not poets.”

Padmini tapped her stick.

“You risk much,” she said. “If this Lannoy plays both sides, he could cut us badly.”

“Everything worth doing risks much,” Ramayyan said. “Keeping him caged and useless would be safer. It would also be stupid.”

“We will watch him,” Marthanda Varma said. “We have men who are very good at watching.”

I thought of Ramayyan's ledgers, of the careful lines recording who owed what to whom, who spoke to which envoy, which guard looked where when.

Lannoy might think himself free if he accepted the offer. In truth, he would be stepping into a web as intricate as any dungeon.

Later, as the hall emptied and the heat of midday pressed down, I climbed to the upper level where the Dutch captain had been taken.

He sat near an open window, looking out toward the sea. His hands were loosely bound in front of him with a strip of cloth that would not stop a determined man from eating or scratching his nose, but would remind him at every moment of his status.

“You came to persuade me?” he asked without turning.

“No,” I said. “I came to see which way your face points when you look at the horizon.”

He glanced back, amused despite himself.

“It points toward my home,” he said. “Always will.”

“Home is not only a place,” I said. “Sometimes it is a decision. Ask any man who left his village for a fort and never went back.”

He looked out again.

“In my land,” he said, “we tell stories of men who go east and never return. They are spoken of with awe or pity. If I stay, I become one of those. A ghost in company records. A cautionary tale for young officers.”

“Here,” I said, “you become something else.”

He considered that.

“And you, Nagoji Sawant,” he said, using my name with more ease now. “What are you here?”

“A man trying not to drown in other people's plans,” I said. “So far, I have managed. Tomorrow, who knows”

He laughed, genuinely this time.

“Honest,” he said. “I like that. My own commanders would have fed me a speech about destiny by now.”

“Our Brahmins handle destiny,” I said. “The rest of us handle mud.”

We sat in companionable silence for a few breaths, both looking at the line where sea met sky.

“Your king is dangerous,” Lannoy said finally.

“So is yours,” I replied.

“Mine has distance,” he said. “He does not look into my eyes when he asks me to spend men. Your king does. That is... uncomfortable.”

“That discomfort might be what keeps you honest,” I said.

He nodded once, slowly.

“Perhaps,” he said.

When I left him, he was still staring at the horizon.

At sunrise, we would learn whether he had chosen to keep looking west or to turn his gaze fully to the land he had tried to break.

The prisoners of this new king were not just men in bonds.

We were all, in one way or another, bound to decisions made in that hall.

The difference was that some of us had chosen our chains.
