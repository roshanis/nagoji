# Book III, Chapter 15: Prisoners of a New King

The end came with a lie, or perhaps just a misunderstanding of what honour meant on this coast.

On the 7th of August, the smoke from the great explosion still drifted across the sands of Colachel. The Dutch had signaled their readiness to treat. Terms had been agreed upon, or so they believed.

They marched out of their ruined camp at mid-morning.

It was a strange sight. Beaten men, coats stained with soot and blood, yet forming ranks with their drums beating. They carried their muskets. Their officers wore their swords. The agreement was that they would be compelled to surrender the fort but allowed to march with their arms to the Dutch factory at Kanyakumari.

I sat on my horse near the dunes, watching them come.

“They look relieved,” Dhanaji said. “They think they are going for a long walk and then a boat home.”

“The King does not let tigers walk away because they promise not to bite,” I said.

Marthanda Varma waited on the rise where our main battery had stood. His Nair infantry lined the path the Dutch were taking, silent, impassive.

When the last Dutch soldier had stepped away from the charred remains of the stockade, the trap snapped shut.

A conch blew.

Suddenly, the Nair lines thickened. Spears lowered. Matchlocks were raised from behind the dunes where my riders had waited. The path to Kanyakumari was blocked by a wall of shields.

The Dutch column halted. Confusion rippled through their ranks. An officer—Lannoy, I presumed—shouted something, pointing his sword towards the road.

Ramayyan rode forward.

“The road is closed,” he said, his voice carrying over the wind. “You are prisoners of the State of Travancore.”

“We have terms!” Lannoy shouted back, his face darkening with rage. “We are to march out with arms!”

“You have marched out,” Ramayyan said calmly. “Now you will drop the arms.”

For a moment, I thought they would fight. I saw hands tighten on musket stocks. I saw Lannoy’s knuckles turn white on his hilt. They were surrounded, outnumbered twenty to one, starving and shocked, but they were soldiers.

But Lannoy looked at his men, hollow-eyed, burnt, swaying with fatigue. He looked at the thousands of fresh Nair troops ringing them.

He swore, a short, sharp sound. Then he unbuckled his sword belt and threw it into the sand.

“Down,” he ordered.

The clatter of hundreds of muskets falling onto the beach sounded like a heavy rain.

“Take them,” Varma said.

We took twenty-four European officers that day, including Eustachius De Lannoy and his second, Donadi. We took hundreds of soldiers, their muskets, their drums, and the few cannon that hadn't burst in the fire.

They were not marched to Kanyakumari. They were marched inland, away from the sea that had failed to save them, to the granite walls of Udayagiri Fort.

***

Two days later, I stood in a stone courtyard within Udayagiri.

The air here was different, still heavy with moisture, but held close by the hills and the high walls. The Dutch officers had been separated from their men. They were kept in the upper quarters, treated better than common prisoners but watched by guards who never blinked.

Marthanda Varma had summoned Lannoy.

The meeting took place in a small hall used for private audiences. No throne, just a low platform and simple mats. Ramayyan was there, of course, his stylus ready.

And beside him sat Mathoo Tharakan. He was no longer just the merchant I had seen at the war council. Today, he wore the heavy gold chains and silk tunic of a *Valia Sarvadhi Karyakkar*, a high noble of the court. Marthanda Varma had elevated him, breaking centuries of caste tradition to place a Syrian Christian at the heart of his durbar. It was a statement as loud as any cannon: in this new Travancore, power flowed to those who built the state, regardless of the god they prayed to.

I stood by the door, a silent witness.

Lannoy was brought in. He looked better than he had on the beach, washed, his wound bandaged, though his coat was still the same stained blue. He did not bow.

“You have a strange way of keeping treaties,” he said, his voice flat.

Marthanda Varma studied him.

“I keep the treaties that benefit my people,” the king said. “Allowing an enemy army to march to another fort so they can attack me again next year does not benefit anyone but you.”

“Honour,” Lannoy began.

“Honour is eating well and sleeping without fear,” Varma cut him off. “Dead men have no honour. You are alive. That is the only term that matters.”

Lannoy fell silent. He knew enough of war to know that the loser does not dictate the vocabulary of the aftermath.

“You are Eustachius De Lannoy,” the king said. “You know guns. You know drill. You know how to build forts that do not burn when a lucky shot hits them.”

“I am a Captain of the Dutch East India Company.”

“The Company is a ledger,” Varma said.
			
“And a ledger with too much red ink is burned,” Tharakan interjected softly, his voice carrying the weight of a man who owned half the warehouses on the coast.

“It has already written you off,” the King continued, nodding at his noble. “Do you think they will send a fleet to rescue a man who lost a beachhead? They will count the cost, shake their heads, and hire a new captain.”

Lannoy flinched. It was a small movement, but it betrayed him.

“What do you want?” he asked.

“I want you to build me an army that fights like yours,” Varma said. “But better. Because it will fight for its own land, not for pepper prices.”

“You want me to turn my coat.”

“I want you to change your master,” Varma said. “Serve me. Train my men. Cast cannon for us. Build walls that stand.”

“And if I refuse?”

“Then you remain in Udayagiri,” Ramayyan said. “Not as a guest, but as a prisoner. You will rot here while the world forgets your name. And eventually, you will die here, of fever or old age, wondering what you might have built.”

Lannoy looked at the stone floor. He looked at the window, where the green hills of Travancore rose against the sky.

“And if I accept?”

“You keep your sword,” Varma said. “You keep your rank. You rise as high as your skill takes you. You become the Valia Kappithan the Great Captain of my forces.”

It was a staggering offer. To go from a prisoner in a dungeon to the commander of the army that had defeated him.

Lannoy looked at me.

“You were a mercenary once,” he said. “Before you were a courtier.”

“I am still a mercenary,” I said. “I just found a payer who offers more than coin.”

“And does he keep his word?”

“He kept me alive when others would have hanged me,” I said. “And he let you live when he could have let the Nair boys spear you on the beach.”

Lannoy took a long breath. He looked at his hands, then at the King.

“I have men,” he said. “Donadi. The others.”

“They can serve too,” Varma said. “Or they can wait. The choice is theirs. But the offer starts with you.”

The silence stretched. I could see the calculation in the Dutchman’s eyes. The loyalty to a distant flag warring with the reality of the stone walls and the indifference of the corporate master he had served.

“I will not fight against the Dutch,” he said finally.

“I do not need you to fight them,” Varma said, a smile touching his lips. “I need you to make sure I do not have to fight them again. Or if I do, that they lose even faster.”

Lannoy nodded slowly.

“Then,” he said, “I accept.”

Marthanda Varma did not rise. He simply nodded to Ramayyan.

“Good,” the King said. “Ram will draw up the papers. You start tomorrow.”

“Tomorrow?” Lannoy looked surprised.

“The war isn't over just because you surrendered,” Varma said. “There are other factories. Other chiefs. There is always work. Go. Sleep. You will need your strength.”

As guards escorted the new Great Captain out, Ramayyan looked up from his leaf.

“He will be useful,” the Dalawa said.

“He will be a weapon,” Varma said. “And like any weapon, we must make sure he points away from us.”

He looked at me.

“That will be part of your task, Nagoji. You speak his language. You know his kind. Watch him. Be his friend holding the shield.”

“Friendship with a man you helped capture is a complicated thing,” I said.

“Life is complicated,” Marthanda Varma said, standing up and reaching for his spear. “That involves surviving it. The simple things usually end in funerals.”

We walked out into the courtyard of Udayagiri. The sun was high now. The Dutch prisoners, no, the Dutch recruits, were being fed in the lower yard. They looked up as we passed, fear mixing with curiosity.

They did not know it yet, but they had just become the seed of the Travancore Nair Brigade.

History is strange. It turns on a lucky shot, a broken promise, and a conversation in a stone room.

I looked at the walls of the fort. They were strong. But with Lannoy’s help, I knew they would become stronger. And Travancore, this slip of land between the mountains and the sea, would become something no one, not even the great Companies of Europe, could swallow.
