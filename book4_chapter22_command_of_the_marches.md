# Book IV, Chapter 22: Command of the Marches

The king liked to meet his gods without witnesses.

Not at the great temples where priests and courtiers watched every gesture, but at the older shrine in the Padmanabhapuram temple complex, on its rocky hill a little inland from the coast, half swallowed by jackfruit trees and old stone.

“If I breathe too often under carved ceilings,” he had said once, “I forget what rain smells like on bare rock.”

It was there, at Padmanabhapuram, that he summoned me on the morning the chevar came.

We rode without escort.

Ramayyan had protested, in his careful way, arguing for at least a few guards, a few trusted Nair blades, a Marakkar with a keen eye. “You remember the festival night when you fell on the temple stones,” he said. “Not every knife announces itself.” Marthanda Varma listened, then shook his head.

“If a king cannot sit with his god without a wall of men between them,” he said, “he is already dead.”

“If you die,” Ramayyan replied, “so do many of us who had no say in that decision.”

In the end they compromised.

The guards came with us as far as the foot of the hill. There, at a narrow stone stair that cut up through the trees, the king dismounted and handed his reins to a waiting boy.

“You will have your men,” he told Ramayyan, who had followed us that far. “They will wait here. If I do not come down by the time the sun reaches that palm’s top frond, you may storm the gods' courtyard and scold me.”

Ramayyan did not laugh. He only bowed and stepped back.

“Take Sawant,” he said. “If you insist on trusting no one else with your back today, at least trust the man who has seen how Europeans strike.”

So it was that I climbed the temple steps beside a king, alone, with no sound but our breath and the distant murmur of the forest.

The shrine was small.

Its gopuram barely rose above the trees. The outer wall, once painted, now showed patches of bare stone where lime had peeled. A single priest swept the courtyard, his old arms moving with steady rhythm. A few women in faded saris lit lamps at a side altar and murmured prayers.

The inner courtyard was barely the size of a Deccan village house.

Stone flags underfoot. A low mandapa leading to the sanctum, its entrance hung with strings of wilting jasmine. In the centre of the space stood a single jackfruit tree, its trunk thick, its roots pushing up between the stones, its shade cool.

Marthanda Varma stepped under the tree, hands coming together in a brief namaskaram.

Without his spear, without his platform, he looked less like a king and more like any other man who had brought his worries to a god. The muscles at the back of his neck were tight. The lines around his eyes had deepened in the years since I had first seen him in the coastal hall.

“Wait here,” he said quietly. “If anyone comes, tell them the king is scolding his god and does not wish to be scolded in return.”

He moved toward the sanctum, where the priest now prepared lamps.

I stayed near the jackfruit tree, eyes scanning the courtyard.

Old habit.

Count the exits. The shadows. The people.

The two women had already left, their bangles jingling faintly as they descended the outer steps. The priest moved between sanctum and side room, fussing with ghee and wicks. A dog slept in a patch of sun near the wall, twitching occasionally in some chase dream.

Everything seemed ordinary.

Then a younger priest stepped out from the side room.

His hair was oiled and tied back, ash smeared thick on his forehead. A white cloth was wrapped cleanly around his waist and over one shoulder in the temple style. In his hands he carried a small brass plate with flowers and a clay lamp. To any casual eye he was simply another servant of the god coming to tend the flame.

Only his eyes were wrong.

They were too still.

Devout men have a certain softness around the gaze, a readiness to be distracted by a bird or a child or a stray dog. This man's eyes moved once, to take in the courtyard, and then fixed on the king's back with the unblinking focus of a man who has burned away every other thought.

I felt the hairs on my arms rise.

He walked toward the sanctum, footsteps almost soundless on the stone. In his hands, the brass plate did not rattle. The little lamp's flame burned steady despite the faint breeze.

He passed within arm's length of me.

“Ayya,” I said softly, in Malayalam. “The priest is busy. You may have to wait.”

He ignored me and stopped a few paces from the king.

He lifted the brass plate until the lamp's light touched Marthanda Varma's face and spoke in a low, formal Malayalam that rolled too fast for my Deccan ears. I caught only fragments. Eight houses. Vow. Chevar.

Whatever the full words, the king understood them.

I saw his shoulders tighten, his hands uncurl from prayer. He turned, not away, but toward the sound, shifting his weight like a man who has chosen to meet a charging bull with his chest rather than his back.

Then the young priest's right hand dropped.

The brass plate clanged as it hit the stone. The flower garland spilled. The little lamp skidded, smearing a line of oil.

In the same motion, his left hand came up from beneath the edge of his cloth.

Steel flashed.

A long dagger, curved slightly, double-edged, held in a reversed grip, the point angled toward his own body, ready to plunge forward into another's.

He lunged toward the king's spine.

My body moved before thought caught up.

I stepped in, left hand snapping out to grab his wrist, fingers closing around bone and tendon. The impact jolted up my arm, but I held. His momentum carried us both forward. My shoulder thudded into his ribs. The dog woke with a bark and fled.

Marthanda Varma half turned, the movement spoiling the chevar's line.

Yes, chevar.

The word surfaced with the shock.

I had heard of such men in stories. Warriors from the north who bound their hair with certain knots, whispered oaths before goddesses, and swore to die taking down their target. Men who trained not for survival, but for a single moment of impact.

His strength surprised me.

He was not a large man, but his arm felt like a rope pulled taut. He twisted his wrist, trying to slide the blade free of my grip, not to escape, but to find another angle toward the king.

His elbow slammed into my ribs.

Pain flared along my side. My grip loosened for a fraction of a heartbeat. He used that sliver of freedom to wrench his arm, the dagger's point scraping along my palm.

Blood slicked our hands.

The blade darted up, now aiming for the king's throat rather than his back.

Marthanda Varma moved.

Later, when I thought back on it, I realised that the stories of his youth, the ones about him fighting his uncles' men in temple courtyards and river fords, had not been exaggerated.

He stepped inside the dagger's arc instead of away, his left hand snapping out to clamp down on the chevar's forearm just above my grip. His right hand drove into the man's throat, fingers stiff, the way kalari masters strike at certain points.

The chevar gagged, his breath catching.

For most men, that would have ended the fight.

He was not most men.

With a strangled sound, he snapped his head forward, his forehead crashing into the king's brow. Bone met bone with a dull crack. Marthanda Varma reeled back a step, blood already trickling down between his eyes.

The dagger surged forward again, this time toward the soft flesh under his jaw.

My right hand, freed for an instant, shot up.

I caught the chevar's wrist with both hands now, fighting not just his arm, but the full weight of his body driving behind it.

We looked like dancers locked in an awkward embrace, our arms tangled, our faces inches apart.

His breath stank of betel and something metallic, with a resinous sweetness I had smelled in northern camps. Kanjav, chewed to make a man deaf to the thought of his own death. His eyes were wide, pupils blown, not with terror, but with some fierce joy.

“For the old houses,” he rasped again, in a voice torn by the strike to his throat. “For those he broke.”

He tried to knee me in the belly. I twisted, letting the blow glance off my hip.

I drove my forehead into his cheekbone.

Stars burst behind my eyes. A wet crunch told me his nose had fared worse.

We staggered, feet slipping on the oil from the fallen lamp.

His heel skidded. For a heartbeat, balance deserted him.

I used that opening.

Dropping my weight, I hooked my foot behind his ankle and heaved, twisting his wrist as I did.

We went down together.

The stone slammed into my shoulder. Something popped, a hot line of pain shooting down my arm.

The dagger clattered, skidding away across the floor, spinning once before coming to rest against a pillar.

The chevar did not hesitate.

He rolled toward me, fingers clawing, nails digging into my face, my neck. His right hand shot for my belt, seeking any weapon there. Finding none, he curled those fingers into a fist and drove it toward my throat.

Marthanda Varma's foot took him in the ribs.

The king had regained his balance.

He kicked not like a courtier, but like a man who had spent hours in bare earth pits, stamping out on straw men the patterns kalari masters taught. His heel drove into the chevar's side with a meaty thud.

The man's body folded around the impact.

Before he could uncurl, the king dropped onto him, one knee pinning his arm, one hand seizing a fistful of hair and slamming his head against the stone.

Once.

Twice.

The third time, the chevar's eyes lost focus for a fraction of a heartbeat.

That was enough.

I scrambled, crawling across the stone, shoulder screaming, hand slick with blood, reaching for the fallen dagger.

Fingers closed around the hilt.

The metal felt warm from recent life.

I turned, blade ready.

The chevar, pinned under the king's weight, saw the steel.

He did not flinch.

He bucked, using what little freedom he had left, not to escape, but to drive his body upward, trying to impale himself on the point, to push his chest toward it so that his death might yet score the king.

Marthanda Varma shifted, taking the brunt of that surge on his own shoulder.

The chevar's head collided with his jaw. Teeth clicked. Blood sprayed from the king's split lip.

For a moment, I feared the dagger would find us all.

Then training took over.

Instead of driving the blade straight down, I angled it, sliding the edge along the chevar's throat and then pressing, hard, at a shallow cut.

He thrashed.

I cut again, deeper this time, at the side of the neck, where I knew bigger veins ran close to the surface under the skin.

Warmth spilled over my hand.

His movements became more frantic, then weaker, then stuttered.

He stared up at the tree above us, at its leaves, at the patch of sky, at a god only he could see.

“For the old...” he whispered, the last word lost in a wet gurgle.

Then he was still.

For a long moment, all I could hear was breath.

My own, ragged. The king's, rough. The priest's, somewhere near the sanctum, high and panicked. The dog's, whining from behind a pillar.

The smell in the courtyard had changed.

Jackfruit leaves and ghee lamps and old stone, now cut through with the sharp iron tang of fresh blood.

Marthanda Varma eased himself off the corpse.

His forehead was split, a line of red cutting through the sandal paste. Blood dripped from his lip. His right shoulder hung a little lower than the left.

“You are hurt,” I said.

“So are you,” he replied.

Only then did I notice the sting in my palm where the dagger had scraped, the dull ache in my ribs, the persistent throb in my dislocated shoulder.

The priest shuffled forward, hands shaking.

“Maharaja,” he stammered. “Forgive... I did not... he came as any other... I...”

“Quiet,” Marthanda Varma said, not unkindly. “Fetch water. Clean cloth. And send a boy down to Ramayyan. Tell him the king has slipped on the temple steps and needs a bandage.”

The priest stared, then bobbed his head and fled, sandals slapping on the stone.

We sat under the jackfruit tree, backs against the trunk, the chevar's body lying a little distance away, already losing the tension that had made him so dangerous.

“Chevar,” Marthanda Varma said after a while, testing the word on his split lip. “From the marches, most likely. One of the old Eight Houses that still dream of undoing me.”

“He said it was for the old houses,” I said.

“Of course,” he said. “Men like him are always for something old. They rarely live long enough to see whether the old was worth killing for.”

He wiped blood from his brow with the back of his hand, smearing it.

“You moved fast,” he added, almost as an afterthought.

“Not fast enough,” I said, flexing my sore fingers.

“Fast enough to make me reach for his arm instead of my neck,” he said. “Fast enough that I have time now to think about the problem, instead of meeting my ancestors earlier than I wish.”

We sat in silence a little longer.

“This is why Ramayyan hates when I come alone,” he said finally. “He counts these risks. He writes them in his leaves. Today he will add a line in red.”

“He will add one for me too,” I said.

“He already had one for you,” the king said. “Today, perhaps, he will underline it.”

He turned his head, wincing.

“You could have stepped aside,” he said quietly. “Left him to his path. I would be lying broken on this stone now. You would have a clear road north, in the confusion that followed.”

“I did not think,” I said. “My body moved.”

“Bodies move toward what they trust,” he said. “Remember that.”

Footsteps sounded on the stair below, fast and many.

Ramayyan burst into the courtyard, two guards behind him. His usually composed face was tight, eyes scanning the scene in a single sweep.

He took in the corpse, the blood, the king's split brow, my bruised shoulder.

His jaw clenched.

“Steps,” he said flatly. “You slipped on the steps.”

Marthanda Varma smiled faintly.

“The gods are clumsy hosts,” he said.

Ramayyan exhaled through his nose, then nodded once, accepting the fiction for what it was.

“We will clear this,” he said, gesturing to the body. “Quietly. I will have questions. Later.”

He looked at me.

“You too,” he said. “Do not ride far until we have spoken.”

For once, there was no humour in his voice.

Later, when the blood had been washed from the stone and a fresh smear of sandal paste applied as if to heal both floor and pride, we sat in a small room off the fort courtyard, my shoulder bound, the king's brow stitched.

Ramayyan paced like a caged tiger.

“I keep ledgers,” he said. “I count chiefs who murmur. I watch Dutch papers. I listen to Marakkar gossip. I have already seen arrows loosed from our own walls, poison in lamp oil, knives in festival crowds. I knew there were men who wished you dead. I did not know one had hired a chevar.”

“If you had,” Marthanda Varma said, “you would have forbidden me to climb that hill. I would have gone anyway.”

Ramayyan stopped pacing.

“Yes,” he said. “That is why it infuriates me.”

He turned to me.

“You took the blade meant for him,” he said. “Or at least, the first one. That buys you more than thanks.”

Marthanda Varma shifted in his seat.

“It confirms something I had been weighing,” he said. “Ram worries about the north. About what you will do if your hills call you loudly enough. I worry about the marches. About men there who watch my growing strength and wonder whether they might trim it while Dutch eyes are elsewhere.”

He looked at me.

“I cannot stand on every fort wall myself,” he said. “I cannot sit in every temple courtyard. I cannot ride every patrol. I need men whose first instinct, when a dagger appears, is to move toward my chest, not away from it.”

My bruised ribs ached at the memory.

“So,” he said, “I will give you what I once offered and you once refused. Land. A house. A permanent command on the northern marches. Horse that answer to your word. Men who will look to you when they see smoke on the horizon.”

Ramayyan's eyes flicked between us, measuring.

“If you accept,” the king went on, “you tie yourself to this kingdom in a way that will be hard to undo. If you later decide to ride north, you will not do so as a free blade, but as a man breaking his own oath.”

“A chevar in reverse,” I said. “Sworn to die in one place instead of to kill in another.”

He smiled, though the split in his lip made the motion painful.

“Something like that,” he said.

“You do not have to answer now,” Ramayyan interjected quickly. “This is a fevered moment. Blood runs hot. Decisions made when the smell of iron is still in the nose can feel different when it fades.”

I shook my head.

“No,” I said. “If I think too long, I will count too many futures and ride in none. I am tired of standing with one foot in each river.”

I looked at the king.

“I will take your marches,” I said. “I will build horse there that answer to this land. I will send word north of what I have chosen. If the Peshwa or his men think me traitor, they can write my name in their own ledgers. I have no space left in mine for their judgments.”

Ramayyan closed his eyes briefly, then opened them.

“So noted,” he said softly.

“Good,” Marthanda Varma said. “Then this is settled. Ram will see that the orders are written. Padmini will scold you for taking on more work. Revathi will scold you for choosing us over her old worlds. The rest we will handle as it comes.”

He raised his cup of watered buttermilk.

“To clumsy gods and fast horses,” he said.

I raised mine.

“To careful reckonings that keep us alive long enough to regret our choices,” I replied.

He laughed, wincing, and drank.

When word of my new command reached Padmini, she came to the fort with her stick tapping more sharply than usual.

“So,” she said, looking me up and down. “You finally decided which current to trust. I hope your horse can swim.”

“They can,” I said. “I am less sure about their rider.”

“You managed a chevar,” she said. “The marches will be easier. At least there, the men who want to kill you will have to ride a little before they try.”

As I rode north some weeks later, standard snapping above my cavalry column, shoulder still aching faintly in the evenings, I thought of the temple stone, of the thin line between life and death measured by inches of steel and a man's decision to step in instead of aside.

The marches waited.

So did whatever knives the old houses there had honed in the dark.

But for the first time since Goa, I felt not like wreckage caught between currents, but like part of a river that had chosen its course.
