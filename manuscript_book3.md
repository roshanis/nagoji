# Tiger's Heir

*RV Menon*

1760: The Deccan. A branded opium addict rides south into Travancore. Tipu Sultan will try to burn the kingdom down, and the man with fire on his face must decide what he is willing to become.

# Chapter 1: The Knife in the Dark

I will tell you what I was, because you need to understand what I became.

I was twenty years old the night I killed the priest. Twenty years old and already a ruin, hollowed out by the black paste I smoked in the dens of Sangamner.

Opium.

The word sounds almost gentle. It is not gentle. It is a god that demands everything and gives nothing back but hunger for more.

My father was Dhanaji, a cavalry rider who had served in the south. He rode beside a man named Nagoji Sawant in the old wars, and he came home with a jeweled knife and stories that made other men sit straighter. He married. He raised a son. He watched that son rot.

I do not remember the first time I smoked. I remember the first time I needed to. The difference matters.

At first it was a pleasure I could afford. Then it was a necessity I could not. I sold my horse. I sold my sword. I sold my mother's bangles. I sold my father's patience a little at a time until there was none left.

When there was nothing left to sell, I stole.

I stole small things at first. Coins from sleeping men. Grain from unattended sacks. A ring from a drunken merchant who would not remember the loss in the morning.

Small thefts become large. Not because you become braver, but because hunger grows.

That is how I found myself at the temple.

---

The village temple sat on the edge of the fields, a squat stone building with a small tower and a courtyard where children played during festivals. By day it smelled of ghee lamps and marigold. By night it smelled of damp stone and bat droppings.

I went there after midnight with the taste of opium still coating my tongue and my hands trembling for more.

The temple had a donation box. Everyone knew it did. Men dropped coins into it after prayers and told themselves the gods were watching. The gods were not watching. The pujari watched. The pujari always watched.

I crept across the courtyard barefoot, stepping around puddles, avoiding the loose stones that would click underfoot. The sky was moonless. The world felt close, as if the darkness itself had hands.

The door was not locked. A temple door is rarely locked. Men believe sanctity is stronger than wood.

Inside, the air was cooler. The idols loomed in the half light, faces black with oil and age. A rat skittered. Somewhere a bell chain moved slightly, stirred by wind or something else.

My mouth went dry.

I told myself I was not afraid of gods. I had not been afraid of gods for a long time. Opium had burned that fear out of me and replaced it with a different one.

I was afraid of waking up without the paste.

I crossed to the donation box and knelt, knife in my hand.

The lock was cheap. I could feel it through the blade as I pried, the metal resisting, then yielding with a small reluctant snap.

The box opened.

Coins glinted faintly inside.

For a heartbeat, I felt something like relief.

Then a voice came from behind me.

"Who is there?"

The pujari's voice was not loud. It did not need to be loud. It was the voice of a man who belongs to a place.

I froze, coin dust on my fingers.

The pujari held a small oil lamp. The flame made his face jump with shadow. He was older than I expected, his hair grey at the temples, his eyes sharp.

He looked at the open box.

He looked at my knife.

Then he looked at my face.

His eyes widened.

"Dhanaji's son," he whispered.

The words should have stopped me.

They should have pulled me back into the world where fathers matter and shame can still cut.

Instead they ignited something in me.

Opium makes you selfish. It makes you believe your need is the only need in the world. It makes other people's lives feel like obstacles.

The pujari stepped forward, lamp held high, and I saw what he was going to do.

He was going to shout.

He was going to wake the village.

He was going to drag my father's name through mud.

I moved before thought formed.

The knife flashed.

The pujari's mouth opened.

No sound came out.

His lamp fell, the flame licking across the floor before dying in spilled oil.

He collapsed against the stone, hands clawing at his throat.

Blood pooled dark and thick.

For a moment I stood there, coin dust on my fingers, watching him twitch.

I had seen men bleed before. I had seen animals slaughtered. I had watched my own veins stand out when the craving hit too hard.

This was different.

This was a priest.

This was a man who had spoken my father's name.

The temple felt smaller.

The idols felt closer.

Somewhere outside, a dog barked once.

Then another voice shouted in the courtyard.

"Pujari?"

Footsteps ran.

---

The Deshmukh's son came in with a torch.

He was young, strong, dressed in cloth too fine for this hour. He had been drinking, I could smell it, but he moved with purpose. He had heard the bark, the shout, the disturbance, and he had come because that was what a Deshmukh's son does.

He saw the pujari on the ground.

He saw the blood.

He saw me at the open donation box.

For a heartbeat we stared at each other, and in that heartbeat I saw his whole life.

A man raised to believe he was responsible for order.

A man who would become his father's right hand.

A man who would have children and land and people who bowed when he walked past.

And I saw my own life reflected in his eyes.

A man with nothing but hunger.

He drew his sword.

"Drop it," he said.

His voice shook, not with fear, with fury. A temple defiled was an insult that demanded blood.

I should have dropped the knife.

I should have run.

I should have done anything but what I did.

But opium had made me stupid. It had stripped consequence from my mind. It had taught me that violence solves problems quickly.

I stepped toward him.

His sword came up.

We collided in the narrow space between idols and stone.

His blade caught my shoulder and scraped, hot pain flashing.

I struck back with the knife, low, desperate.

He jerked away, surprised. The knife cut his arm.

He swore and tried to bring the sword down again.

I ducked, slipped on oil, and drove the knife forward.

It went under his ribs.

The resistance was softer than I expected.

His breath left him in a thin sound.

His torch fell and rolled, flame licking, throwing light across the idols as if the gods were moving.

The Deshmukh's son stared at me, eyes wide, and then he sagged against the wall and slid down into the blood.

His sword clattered onto stone.

I stood over him, chest heaving, knife in my hand, and understood, too late, what I had done.

One death could be an accident.

Two is a pattern.

Outside, men shouted.

The village was waking.

---

They caught me before I reached the courtyard wall.

A farmer's stick cracked against my back. A fist hit my jaw. Someone grabbed my hair and yanked my head up so the torchlight could show my face.

"Bhalerao," a voice spat.

The name sounded like a curse.

Hands dragged me into the courtyard.

Women screamed when they saw blood on my clothes. Men shouted for rope. Someone ran to the Deshmukh's house.

I tried to speak.

I tried to explain.

There is nothing to explain.

They tied my wrists and pushed me to my knees in the mud.

The Deshmukh arrived with his guards before dawn, his face hard, his eyes red, his body moving like a man who has become pure rage.

He saw his son's body carried out of the temple.

He saw the dead pujari.

He saw me in the mud.

If he had killed me there, no one would have stopped him.

Instead he looked at the village elders and spoke in a voice that was almost calm.

"Trial," he said.

That was his mercy.

He wanted my death to be lawful.

He wanted everyone to watch.

---

The trial lasted less than a day.

What is there to debate when two bodies lie in front of a temple and the killer is tied in the courtyard?

The elders spoke of defilement.
The priest's family wept.
The Deshmukh did not weep. He stared at me as if his gaze could burn me alive.

Someone asked if I had been possessed.

The question made men laugh bitterly.

Possession was a story people told when they did not want to admit that a man could choose evil.

I was sentenced to death.

Not only death.

Disgrace.

They would brand me first, so that even if some miracle kept me alive, I would carry the truth on my face.

When the iron came out of the fire, I thought I would faint.

It was shaped into letters.

Marathi letters, the kind my mother had taught me to read when I was a boy and still had a future.

The man holding the iron did not hesitate.

He pressed it to my forehead.

The smell of burning flesh is not like any other smell. It is intimate. It is your body announcing that it has been violated.

Pain exploded through my skull. Light shattered behind my eyes. I screamed until my throat tore and the scream became a hoarse animal sound.

When they pulled the iron away, the world swam.

Someone poured water on my face.

The water hissed against the wound.

The village elder leaned close enough that I could smell betel on his breath.

"Brahmin-killer," he said, translating the letters for anyone who could not read. "Let him wear it."

They dragged me to the execution ground in the afternoon, the brand throbbing, the skin already swelling, the letters burned deep enough that they would never fade.

My father's name was being shouted in the crowd like an accusation.

Dhanaji's son.

Dhanaji's son.

---

I saw my father only when they forced me to stand.

The execution ground was a dry patch beyond the village where men hanged thieves and pretended justice was clean. A neem tree stood there, its branches heavy, indifferent.

They tied the rope.

They pushed me onto the stool.

The crowd surged closer.

The Deshmukh stood at the front, face still, eyes burning.

Then the crowd parted as if something sharp had cut it.

My father rode in.

Dhanaji looked older than he had the last time I saw him, which had been weeks before. Opium steals time. It makes you forget how fast people age when you are not watching.

He wore no armour. He carried a sword. His horse's flanks were lathered.

He took in the scene in one glance.

The dead bodies had already been burned, but their absence was still present, hanging like smoke.

His gaze found my face.

The brand.

I watched something in him tighten.

Not surprise.

Not confusion.

Grief.

Then his eyes shifted to the Deshmukh, and the grief hardened into something like iron.

"Uncle," my father called, using a word that was almost an insult. "Enough."

The Deshmukh's mouth twisted.

"Your son killed my son," he said.

My father nodded.

"He did," he replied.

The simplicity of it was worse than denial.

Then my father did something I did not expect.

He swung off his horse and walked toward the elders.

Men shouted. Guards raised spears.

My father did not stop.

He reached the elder and spoke low, words I could not hear.

The elder's face tightened. He shook his head.

My father said something again, more urgent.

The elder shook his head again.

My father looked at the rope.

Then he looked at me.

His eyes were steady.

No apology.

No comfort.

Only a command.

Go.

He drew his sword.

The crowd shouted.

Guards surged forward.

My father moved like the cavalryman he was. He cut one spear shaft, slashed another man's arm, shoved through bodies as if they were reeds.

Someone grabbed the rope and tried to pull it tight.

My father struck that man in the face with the flat of his blade and the man went down howling.

My father reached the stool, cut the rope above my head, and shoved me down.

"Run," he hissed, voice like gravel. "Do not look back."

I stumbled, fell into mud, tried to stand.

My father slapped my cheek hard enough to make my ears ring.

"Run," he repeated.

So I ran.

I ran through the crowd as men shouted and hands grabbed and someone threw a stone that cracked against my shoulder.

I ran because my father had commanded it, and for once in my ruined life I obeyed.

Behind me, I heard steel ring.

Then I heard my father's voice shout my name, not in anger, in something else.

The sound chased me into the trees.

---

I did not stop until the sun was low and my lungs felt shredded.

I collapsed in scrub beyond the fields, face pressed to dirt, and vomited bile and blood until there was nothing left inside me.

When I could breathe again, I lay still and listened.

No pursuit.

Only insects.

Only wind.

Only the dull ache of the brand swelling on my forehead like a second skull.

Then, faintly, I heard hooves.

I lifted my head.

My father's horse came trotting toward me, riderless, its reins dragging.

There was blood on its flank.

For a moment my mind refused to understand.

Then understanding arrived like a knife.

My father had not been escaping.

He had been buying time.

Time for me.

I sat in the dirt and made a sound that was not a sob, not a cry. My throat was too torn for that. It was a dry animal sound, and it tasted of ash.

I did not go back.

Cowardice and obedience look the same from a distance.

I took the horse and rode toward my father's house, keeping to small paths, head wrapped in cloth to hide the brand.

Night fell.

The village lights faded behind me like a life I had burned down.

---

My father's house was dark.

No lamp burned inside.

No voice called my name.

The door hung slightly open as if someone had left in haste or had not cared enough to close it.

I stepped inside and smelled stale smoke and old sweat. The room looked smaller than it had when I was a boy. Opium shrinks everything.

I went to the corner where my father kept his things.

The jeweled knife lay in its cloth wrap, the stones dull in the dark.

It had been given to him by Nagoji Sawant, a token from a life of war and loyalty I had never earned.

I took it.

Not because I deserved it.

Because I could not leave anything of value behind for the Deshmukh's men to take.

That was how I justified theft even then.

I found my father's letter too, folded and tucked in a wooden box, sealed with wax.

The letter was addressed to Ananthan Pillai in Travancore.

Ananthan was the new name Nagoji Sawant wore in the south.

My father had written it as an escape hatch for a son he must have known would fall.

I held the letter and felt my chest tighten.

He had planned for my ruin.

He had loved me anyway.

Outside, a dog barked.

I froze.

Then I heard men shouting in the distance.

The hunt had begun.

I wrapped the knife and the letter, slung them over my shoulder, and left my father's house without looking back.

The brand on my forehead throbbed with every heartbeat.

The pain was a reminder.

Not a punishment.

A message burned into flesh.

You are what you did.

I rode south into the dark with three ghosts on my back.

The pujari.

The Deshmukh's son.

And my father, dead in my place.

# Chapter 2: The Hunters

The first week was the worst.

Not because of the pursuit, though the Deshmukh's men were never far behind. Not because of hunger or cold nights under trees. The worst part was my own body turning against me.

Opium does not release its prisoners kindly.

For seven days, my muscles cramped as if invisible hands were twisting them. Sweat soaked my clothes, then dried, then soaked them again. My stomach heaved up everything I tried to swallow. My skin itched as if insects crawled beneath it. I shivered so hard my teeth clicked until my jaw ached.

There were moments when I would have crawled back to Sangamner on my hands if someone had promised me a pipe.

Then my father's face would rise in my mind, not as memory, as accusation.

He had died so I could run.

To throw that away for a handful of black paste would have been a betrayal even I could not commit.

So I kept moving south, sick and shaking, with the brand on my forehead burning whenever the cloth slipped.

---

On the second night I stopped in a dry streambed and tried to sleep.

I lay under thorn scrub, the horse tethered close enough that I could hear it breathe. The knife was tucked under my belt. The letter was tied to my chest inside my shirt, as if keeping it there could keep my father's voice close.

Sleep did not come.

When I closed my eyes, I saw the temple floor, dark blood pooling, the pujari's lamp rolling, the Deshmukh's son staring at me as the life left him.

When I opened them again, the night was full of shapes that were not there.

Withdrawal is a kind of haunting.

By dawn my hands were shaking so hard I could barely tighten the saddle.

I mounted anyway.

Movement was the only thing that kept the ghosts from catching me.

---

The Deshmukh's reach was longer than I had understood.

At first I told myself the pursuit would end at the edge of his land. It was comforting to believe borders meant something.

Then I reached a small market village two days south and heard my own crime being sold like spice.

I had stopped at a well to drink. The cloth around my forehead was damp with sweat and slipped when I bent. For a heartbeat the brand showed.

The woman drawing water stared.

Her mouth opened.

I pulled the cloth back down and smiled, the way a man smiles when he wants to look harmless.

"Burned as a boy," I said quickly. "Stable fire."

The lie tasted familiar. Lies are easy when you are already disgusting to yourself.

The woman did not smile back. She backed away, eyes narrowed, and the fear in her face told me she had not believed a word.

I filled my mouth with water and forced myself not to drink too fast.

Across the well, two men in travel-stained turbans were talking.

"One hundred mohurs," one of them said.

The number made the other whistle.

"For a thief?" he asked.

"Not a thief," the first man replied. "A priest-killer. A Deshmukh's son. Branded on the forehead. They say his own father died to free him."

The second man spat into the dust.

"Then his father was a fool," he said.

They laughed.

I kept my head down and drank slowly, listening as if the story was not mine.

One hundred mohurs.

Enough gold to turn a poor man into a hunter.

Enough to make kindness rare.

I left the well without looking back, and within an hour I saw the first sign that the hunters were near.

Horse tracks on a damp patch of ground.

Fresh.

Not mine.

I urged my horse into a walk, forcing it to conserve strength. A fleeing man wants to gallop. A surviving man knows better.

---

On the fourth day, the hunters almost took me.

The road narrowed between low hills, scrub thick on both sides. I smelled ambush before I saw it. Fear has a scent when you have earned it.

My horse's ears flicked forward, then back. It snorted, unhappy.

I slowed.

The silence ahead felt too deliberate.

Then a man stepped onto the road with a spear in his hand and a grin on his face.

"Ho," he called. "Brother. Where are you going in such a hurry?"

Behind him, two more men rose from the scrub.

Their faces were ordinary.

Their eyes were not.

They looked at me the way men look at a goat they plan to slaughter.

I forced my face into a smile.

"South," I said. "To sell horses."

The lead man tilted his head.

"Show us your face," he said.

My throat tightened.

The cloth around my forehead felt suddenly too thin.

I could have turned and run.

They would have thrown spears into my back.

So I did what my father had taught me long ago, when I was still worth teaching.

I acted as if I belonged.

I rode forward.

"Why?" I asked, voice bored, annoyed, as if their request was an inconvenience.

The lead man stepped closer, spear tip lifting.

"Because there is a priest-killer on the road," he said. "And the Deshmukh pays well for his face."

My heart hammered.

I shrugged.

"Then go find him," I said.

I lifted my hand as if to adjust my saddle girth.

Instead my fingers closed around the knife.

The lead man saw the movement.

His grin vanished.

"Stop," he barked.

I did not stop.

I kicked my horse hard in the ribs and threw my body low over its neck.

The horse surged forward.

The spear flashed toward my face.

I felt the point scrape my cheek, hot and shallow.

Then we were through.

Behind me, men shouted and ran.

I heard hooves.

One rider had a horse too.

The chase began.

---

The land was dry and broken, scattered with boulders and thorn trees. A good place for an ambush. A bad place for a chase.

My horse knew it. It picked its way fast, hooves finding purchase where a less sure animal would have fallen.

The hunter's horse pounded behind, heavier, less trained.

I glanced back once and saw the man, face tight, spear in hand.

He was close enough that I could smell his sweat.

Close enough that the one hundred mohurs were shining in his eyes.

I turned forward again and searched for escape.

A narrow cut between rocks opened ahead, a ravine that led down toward a dry riverbed.

I aimed for it.

The ravine was just wide enough for one horse.

My horse slipped through.

The hunter followed without thinking.

That was his mistake.

In the ravine, speed means nothing. There is no room to pass. There is only the horse in front of you and the wall of rock on both sides.

I slowed suddenly.

The hunter's horse slammed into mine, startled, snorting.

The hunter cursed and lifted his spear.

I twisted in the saddle and threw my knife.

The blade hit him in the throat.

The sound was wet and small.

He dropped the spear and clawed at his neck, eyes wide, disbelief flooding his face.

His horse reared, panicked, and the hunter fell backward, hitting the rocks, blood spraying in the tight space.

I sat for a heartbeat, stunned by my own speed.

Then I kicked my horse forward and burst out of the ravine into the open riverbed beyond.

Behind me, the hunter's horse screamed.

My stomach turned.

I had killed again.

Not a priest this time.

Not a Deshmukh's son.

A man who wanted gold.

It did not matter.

Blood is blood.

I rode until my arms shook, then rode more.

By nightfall I reached a larger road, where carts moved and strangers' faces blurred together.

I hid among them, head wrapped tight, eyes down, body aching with withdrawal and violence.

Somewhere behind me, the Deshmukh's hunters would find the body in the ravine and understand that I was still alive.

They would not stop.

Neither would I.


# Chapter 3: The Road South

I learned to lie on the road south.

Not the clumsy lies of a desperate man. Those I had already mastered. I learned the careful, patient lies of a survivor. The lies you tell with your body, your eyes, your voice.

The lies that become so familiar they start to feel like truth.

My name was Govind. I was a horse trader from Pune, traveling south to buy stock from Carnatic breeders. The scar on my forehead was from a stable fire when I was a boy. Tragic, yes, but tragedy makes men humble.

This was the man I invented to cover the brand that shouted my crime to the world.

I wore him like a second skin.

---

I found the caravan outside Aurangabad.

Aurangabad is a city built on ghosts. It had been a Mughal jewel once, full of marble and ambition. By the time I limped into its outskirts, it was a place of cracked walls and tired markets, ruled by the Nizam's men and haunted by the memory of emperors who had thought stone could make them immortal.

In Aurangabad, no one cared who you were as long as you paid.

That was its mercy.

I slept in a stable yard the first night, curled beside a horse that was not mine, the smell of manure and straw dulling the ache of withdrawal. In the dark, I took off the cloth around my head and touched the brand.

The scar tissue was raised, angry. The letters were rough under my fingers.

I did not need to read them.

My skin remembered.

I wrapped the cloth back around my head before dawn and went looking for work.

Work is the one thing a man like me can always find, if he accepts humiliation as a wage.

---

The caravan master was a Muslim from Bidar named Ismail Khan.

He sat on a bale of cloth outside the caravan yard gate, watching his men load camels with the calm authority of a man who knew that commerce is a kind of war fought with numbers instead of swords.

He looked up when I approached.

His eyes took in my posture, my horse, the way I held my hands.

He saw the things men think they can hide.

"You ride well," he said in Dakhni.

I nodded.

"I can handle horses," I replied.

He glanced at the cloth wrapped around my forehead.

"Stable fire?" he asked, tone bored.

The lie had already traveled ahead of me.

I forced a small smile.

"Yes," I said.

Ismail Khan shrugged as if scars were ordinary.

"We leave for Bijapur," he said. "Then south. Bandits on the road. Nizam's officials too. Both want money. If you are strong and you do not steal from me, you can ride with us."

I swallowed.

Steal from him.

The word tasted bitter.

"I will not steal," I said.

Ismail Khan's eyes held mine for a heartbeat.

Then he nodded.

"Then eat," he said. "You look like a man who has been sick."

Sick.

That was kinder than calling me what I was.

I ate rice from a leaf plate while the caravan yard woke around me.

The food sat heavy in my stomach at first, then settled.

For the first time since Sangamner, I felt something like steadiness.

---

We moved out at sunrise, camels swaying, carts creaking, guards walking with spears and matchlocks.

I rode near the rear with two other guards.

One was a thick man named Shankar with three missing fingers on his left hand and a laugh that sounded like gravel. He had fought for Marathas once, then for the Nizam, then for whoever paid.

"War makes men loyal to hunger," he told me on the first day.

The other was a boy named Rahim with a downy beard and eyes too old for his face. He carried a matchlock and tried to look fearless.

The Deccan rolled beneath us, dry and brown, scattered with thorn trees. Villages looked small from the road, their walls low, their wells guarded like treasure.

Everywhere we passed, people watched the caravan with the careful gaze of the poor.

Not envy.

Calculation.

Could we steal from them?
Could they steal from us?

The road teaches you that trust is a luxury.

On the second day, we passed a burned village.

Blackened roof beams stuck out of ash like broken ribs. A dog nosed at something in the debris and then trotted away, uninterested.

Shankar spat.

"Nizam's men," he said. "Or Marathas. Or Mysore. It does not matter. Everyone burns the same."

He glanced at my wrapped head.

"You are running from something," he said.

It was not a question.

My throat tightened.

"A debt," I lied.

Shankar laughed.

"Everyone runs from debt," he said. "Only fools pretend otherwise."

His laughter was not unkind.

It was the laughter of a man who had stopped pretending the world was fair.

---

The bandits came on the fourth day, in a rocky defile where the road narrowed and scrub rose high on both sides.

The passage squeezed the caravan into a single-file knot. Carts and camels bunched so close that the rear could hear the front breathe.

I saw them before the others did.

Not their bodies.

Their intent.

The defile was too quiet. Birds had gone silent. A cart wheel squeaked too loud. The camels snorted and shifted as if smelling danger.

I leaned forward and spoke to Shankar.

"Riders," I whispered.

He looked at me, then at the scrub, then nodded.

Ismail Khan was riding near the front. By the time the guards passed warning forward, the bandits had already moved.

They burst out of the scrub with swords and spears, shouting.

Some hit the lead cart. A spear took a driver in the chest. He fell backward off his seat and the cart lurched, wheel slipping in loose stones.

Others came for the rear, cutting off the easy escape.

Rahim raised his matchlock with shaking hands.

"Fire," Shankar barked.

Rahim fired too high. Smoke burst. The ball vanished into rock.

The bandits were on us.

One swung a curved blade at my horse's neck.

My body moved before thought.

I kicked my horse forward and cut down with the knife, the blade flashing.

It caught the bandit's forearm. Blood sprayed.

The man screamed and fell back.

Another bandit lunged at me with a spear, eyes wild.

I leaned aside and grabbed the spear shaft with my left hand, the wood slick with sweat. The spear point scraped my coat and tore cloth.

I yanked the shaft, pulled the man off balance, and drove the knife into his belly.

He made a sound that was not a shout.

His face went slack.

He folded to the ground.

The sight should have sickened me.

It did not.

That was what frightened me most.

My body remembered violence the way it remembered riding.

Opium had ruined me.

The knife had not.

Shankar was fighting beside me now, spear thrusting, his laugh gone.

Ismail Khan's guards surged back from the front, matchlocks firing low.

The bandits hesitated.

Bandits are brave until the prey bites.

They began to pull away.

Then one bandit, desperate, grabbed at my head cloth.

His fingers hooked the edge and yanked.

The cloth slipped.

Air hit the brand.

The bandit's eyes widened as he saw the scarred letters.

He froze.

"Brahmin-killer," he breathed.

The word cut through the noise.

Shankar heard it.

So did Rahim.

So did the bandits who were retreating.

For a heartbeat, everything paused.

This was the moment when a man decides whether gold matters more than blood.

The Deshmukh's bounty was large enough to buy villages.

I saw the calculation on Shankar's face.

Then Shankar spat into the mud.

"If I take you," he said, voice flat, "I must share with Ismail. I must share with guards. I must share with officials. And then I must sleep with one eye open because your people will come for revenge."

He looked at me.

"Not worth it," he said.

He swung his spear at a bandit who had lingered too long, and the bandit fled.

Rahim stared at my face, horror and fascination mixed.

I pulled the cloth back over the brand with shaking hands.

My breath came too fast.

Not from the fight.

From the knowledge that my face could betray me at any moment.

Ismail Khan rode up, eyes sharp.

He took in the dead bandit at my horse's feet, the blood on my knife, the cloth around my forehead.

He said nothing.

Then he spoke in a voice that carried.

"We move," he ordered. "Now. Before more come."

The caravan lurched forward again, wheels creaking, camels groaning.

As we rode out of the defile, Shankar leaned close.

"Do not thank me," he muttered. "A man does not do mercy for free."

"Then why?" I asked, voice tight.

Shankar's laugh returned, small and ugly.

"Because you fought," he said. "A man who will fight for strangers is worth more than gold."

The sentence landed in me like a stone.

Worth.

I had not felt worth in a long time.

That night, under a leaking canvas, with rain tapping the cloth like fingers, I opened my father's letter for the first time.

The wax seal cracked.

The paper smelled faintly of smoke, as if my father had written it near a fire.

His handwriting was careful, the script of a man who had learned to make words behave.

He wrote of a place called Travancore.

He wrote of Ananthan Pillai, who had once been Nagoji Sawant.

He wrote one sentence that I read again and again until my eyes blurred.

If you have fallen so far that you cannot see the sky, go south. Find him. Tell him I died for you. Tell him the knife is his.

I held the letter to my chest and lay awake listening to rain.

For the first time since Sangamner, I felt something other than hunger.

Not peace.

Direction.

# Chapter 4: Arcot

The Carnatic felt like another world.

The Deccan is hard. Its hills are brown. Its rivers shrink to threads in summer. The wind carries dust and the smell of dry dung. Men speak as if every sentence is a negotiation.

The Carnatic was flatter, hotter, louder. The air tasted of salt even when the sea was far away. The language shifted under my feet. I could still bargain. I could still swear. But the words did not land the same way.

I left Ismail Khan's caravan at Bijapur with a small bundle of rice and a small handful of coins and the kind of gratitude that makes a man feel ashamed because he knows he does not deserve it.

Shankar clapped my shoulder once.

"Do not die stupidly," he said.

It was his blessing.

Then the caravan moved on and the road swallowed me again.

---

I reached Arcot with blistered feet and a head full of lies.

Arcot was the Nawab's city, a place of walls and gardens and debt. The Nawab ruled in name. The English Company ruled in practice. Men bowed to the Nawab in the day and wrote to Madras at night.

I did not understand the politics at first. Politics is just another word for hunger dressed in silk.

What I understood were horses.

In Arcot, horses were everywhere, because war was everywhere. Cavalry mounts stood in stables, ribs showing through hide, their eyes dull from hard riding. Officers argued over fodder prices as if arguing could conjure grass from dust.

I walked into a stable yard near the fort and offered my hands.

The stable master was a Tamil man named Rangan with a scar down his cheek and a face that looked carved from exhaustion.

He watched me pick up a horse's hoof and clean it without flinching.

"Where are you from?" he asked in broken Marathi.

"Pune," I lied.

Rangan's eyes flicked to my forehead cloth.

"Fire," he said, not caring.

"Fire," I agreed.

He nodded.

"Work," he said.

That was Arcot's only question.

So I worked.

I shoveled dung. I carried water. I brushed sweat-stiff hides until my arms burned. I slept in the corner of the stable yard with the smell of horses in my nose, and that smell was the closest thing to comfort I had left.

At night, when the opium craving rose like a tide, I pressed my forehead to the stable wall and breathed until the wave passed.

Sometimes it did not pass.

Sometimes it only withdrew far enough to return later.

---

The English arrived in Arcot on the third day.

I saw them first from the stable yard gate, marching in a line that looked too neat for the dusty road. Red coats. White crossbelts. Drums. Sepoys in Company service walking beside them, their faces set, their eyes scanning.

The English officers rode at the side, pale faces under broad hats, their posture stiff, their hands gloved as if the land itself might stain them.

They looked at the city as if they were already measuring it.

I had heard of the English.

Everyone in the Carnatic had heard of them.

They were like a new kind of merchant, one who carried cannon with the account book.

One sepoy sergeant paused near the stable yard and called out an order in a language that was neither Marathi nor Tamil, but something clipped and sharp.

The sepoys responded instantly.

Discipline.

Not the loose discipline of Maratha horsemen.

The drilled discipline of men taught to move as one body.

I felt a chill.

I had run from a Deshmukh's men.

These men looked like they belonged to something larger than a Deshmukh.

Rangan spat into the dust.

"Company dogs," he muttered.

Then he looked at me and shrugged.

"They pay," he added.

In Arcot, that was enough.

---

The stable yard had a boy named Muthu who had come north from the pepper coast.

He was small, quick, and homesick in a way that made him talk too much.

On the fifth day, as we watered horses, he asked where I was going.

The letter pressed against my chest like a hand.

"South," I said carefully.

Muthu's eyes lit up.

"Travancore?" he asked.

The name sounded strange in my mouth. "Yes," I lied, then realised it was not a lie.

Muthu grinned.

"In Travancore, the king is still the king," he said. "Not like here. Here the Nawab bows to the English and pretends he does not."

He leaned close, conspiratorial.

"In Travancore, they broke the Dutch," he whispered, as if the story was magic. "They broke them at Colachel. My uncle says the sea ran red."

Colachel.

The word meant nothing to me yet, but the way Muthu said it made it feel like a place where outsiders learned humility.

Muthu continued, eager.

"They have a foreign captain too," he said. "A Dutchman. Or French. People say he built their forts."

Foreign captain.

The letter in my chest felt heavier.

Nagoji Sawant had become Ananthan Pillai.

A Maratha had become a Travancore man.

Perhaps that was possible.

Perhaps that was the only kind of miracle left.

---

The hunters found Arcot the way they found everything.

With money.

On the seventh day, as I carried a sack of fodder, I saw a man standing near the stable yard gate.

He was not Tamil. Not Telugu. Not local.

He wore a turban tied in a Maratha style, and he held himself like a horseman even on foot.

His gaze swept the yard with the practised calm of a man searching for something valuable.

Then his eyes caught mine.

For a heartbeat, nothing moved.

Then his gaze dropped to my forehead cloth.

His mouth tightened.

He stepped forward.

My stomach turned to water.

I set the fodder sack down slowly, as if I had all the time in the world.

The man came closer.

I saw the scar at the edge of his jaw. A sword cut, old.

He had been in fights.

He knew what he was looking for.

"Govind," I told myself.

Horse trader.

Stable fire.

I forced a smile.

"Brother," I said in Marathi. "Looking for work?"

The man did not smile back.

"Looking for a face," he replied.

His hand moved slightly, not to a weapon, to the cloth on his own forehead, a gesture that made my skin crawl.

He knew.

Behind him, two more men appeared at the gate.

One hundred mohurs had brought them far.

I glanced toward the yard.

Horses.
Stalls.
Ropes.

No open road.

If they cornered me here, the stable yard would become my grave.

Rangan looked up from a horse's flank and saw the men.

His eyes narrowed.

He had seen hunters before. Every stable man has.

Muthu froze with a bucket in his hands.

The hunter stepped closer.

"Show me your face," he said.

I felt the brand throb under cloth as if it heard its name.

I did not move.

The hunter reached out.

I struck first.

I swung the fodder sack hard into his chest.

The sack hit him like a body.

He stumbled back, startled, arms flailing.

I ran.

I ran toward the horses.

Rangan shouted something in Tamil, sharp and furious.

The hunters shouted too.

I grabbed the nearest horse by the rein and hauled myself onto its back without saddle, bare feet gripping, body low.

The horse bucked once, startled by my weight, then surged forward because horses understand panic.

I kicked it toward the yard gate.

A hunter tried to grab the reins and missed.

The horse's shoulder slammed him aside.

We burst out into the road.

Behind me, men shouted for the Company sepoys.

That was the danger.

If the English caught me, they would not care about Deshmukhs or temples. They would care about disorder. They would hand me over to whoever had the right paper.

I rode hard through Arcot's streets, ducking under hanging cloth, splashing through puddles, hearing the city wake in my wake.

People shouted.
Dogs barked.
A vendor cursed as I knocked over a basket of limes.

Ahead, a line of sepoys turned the corner, muskets in hand, moving with drilled speed.

The sergeant at their head saw me, eyes narrowing.

He raised his hand to signal stop.

I did not stop.

The sergeant's gaze flicked to my forehead cloth and then to the hunters spilling into the street behind.

For a heartbeat, I saw calculation in his face.

Not mercy.

Calculation.

He shouted an order.

The sepoys stepped aside.

Not out of kindness.

Out of indifference.

Let the local men kill each other. It was not the Company's problem yet.

I rode through the gap and out of Arcot before the hunters could close it.

The horse's flanks heaved. My hands shook.

Behind me, the city swallowed the shouting.

Ahead of me, the road south stretched long and empty.

I did not stop until the sun was high and my throat tasted of blood.

Arcot had been a refuge for a week.

Now it was another place where my face had nearly become my death.

Travancore was still far.

But it was the only direction the letter allowed.

# Chapter 5: The Ghats

The Ghats rose before me like a wall between worlds.

I had been walking and riding for weeks since Sangamner, moving through lands that grew stranger with every mile. The Deccan had been dry and familiar in its cruelty. The Carnatic had been hot and crowded with new tongues and Company shadows.

Now the road turned toward mountains.

Not the brown broken ridges of my childhood, but a green barrier crowned with mist. From a distance the hills looked soft. Up close they were teeth.

The traders called them the Western Ghats.

The barrier between the east and the pepper coast.

Men had crossed these mountains for centuries carrying spices one way and silver the other, but the paths were narrow and the jungle did not forgive mistakes.

I crossed anyway.

I had no other direction left.

---

I joined a small group of pepper traders heading west.

They were not generous men. Trade does not make men generous. But they were practical. A rider with a horse can be useful on a mountain path, especially when bandits watch the passes.

They asked my name.

"Govind," I said.

They asked about the cloth around my forehead.

"Fire," I said.

They accepted it the way men accept any story that does not cost them money.

The first day into the Ghats, the air changed.

The heat softened. The wind smelled of wet leaves. The ground underfoot turned dark and spongy, holding water the way a sponge holds blood.

Birds screamed from the canopy. Monkeys hurled fruit and insults down from branches. Leeches found my ankles within an hour.

I slapped at them and swore.

The traders laughed.

"The mountain wants you," one said.

He meant the leeches.

He might have meant something else.

By the second day, mist wrapped around us so thick it felt like cloth.

We moved in single file along paths cut into rock, the drop to one side hidden by white emptiness. A wrong step would not kill you quickly. It would simply remove you from the world.

My horse snorted and stepped carefully, hooves finding purchase where my eyes could not.

I trusted the animal more than I trusted my own judgement.

That was a new kind of humility.

On the third day, we found tiger tracks in the mud.

They were fresh, the paw prints deep, the claw marks faint but present. The traders stopped and stared for a moment, then moved on faster.

No one spoke.

Fear in the jungle is quiet.

I stared at the tracks longer than the others did.

The tiger had walked this path with confidence.

No brand on its face.

No ghost on its back.

It killed because it was built to kill.

I killed because I was broken.

The difference mattered.

---

We reached the crest on the fifth day.

The mist thinned. The air tasted of salt.

Then, through a break in the trees, I saw the world on the other side.

Green.

Not the occasional green of a Deccan monsoon.

A green that looked endless, layered, alive. Coconut palms rose like spears. Backwater channels glinted in the distance. And beyond everything, a pale line that took my breath.

The sea.

I had seen rivers. I had seen lakes. I had seen the wide grey backwater mouths near the coast.

This was different.

This was a horizon that refused to end.

One of the traders watched my face and laughed softly.

"First time?" he asked.

I nodded.

He spat into the dirt.

"The sea makes men feel small," he said. "That is why the gods like it."

We descended into the pepper coast.

The air grew heavy again, not with heat, with moisture. Sweat returned immediately. My clothes clung to my skin. Every breath felt thick.

And everywhere, the smell.

Pepper.

It was in the air, sharp and sweet at once. It rose from vines climbing tree trunks, from drying mats near huts, from sacks loaded onto boats.

The coast was built on that smell.

On the sixth day after the crest, we reached a town by the backwaters where boats moved like silent animals through green water.

Men spoke Malayalam, the words sliding and curling in a way my tongue could not imitate. Women wore cloth draped differently, their bangles clinking. Even the temples looked different, painted brighter, carved with shapes I did not recognise.

I was still in India.

And yet I had stepped into another world.

That night, the traders slept in a warehouse near the water, and I sat outside listening to frogs and oars and distant drums.

I took out my father's letter and read it again by lamplight.

Travancore.
Ananthan Pillai.
Old debts.
The knife is his.

I traced the words with my finger as if touching them could bring my father back.

When the lamp flickered, I imagined his voice.

Go south.

Find him.

The next morning I left the traders and followed the coast road.

People stared at my forehead cloth. In the Deccan, men stared with contempt. Here, men stared with curiosity, as if every outsider was a story.

I asked for directions.

Most people shrugged.

Some pointed.

One old fisherman squinted at the name on my tongue and nodded slowly.

"Ananthan Pillai," he said. "Old man with soldiers in his bones."

He spat into the water.

"Go further south," he said. "Travancore side."

Travancore side.

The phrase made my chest tighten.

Not because Travancore was a salvation.

Because it was my last door.

By the time I saw the first markers of Travancore's border, the sky had darkened.

Clouds piled up heavy over the green.

The wind smelled of rain.

Monsoon was coming.

I pulled the cloth tighter around my forehead and walked toward the compound my father had named.

Somewhere ahead, an old Maratha who had become a Travancore man would look at my face and decide whether I deserved to live.


# Chapter 6: The Gate

Ananthan Pillai's compound did not look like the house of a legend.

In my father's stories, men like Nagoji Sawant lived behind high walls with banners and guards in polished armour. They sat in halls where the floor shone and servants brought silver cups without being asked.

The compound I found was quieter.

A low wall of laterite stone.
A gate made of thick wood darkened by rain.
A courtyard swept clean, not by pride, by habit.

Inside, I could see stables and a small training yard where men moved with spears in their hands, their feet sure in the mud.

The air smelled of wet earth and horses and pepper vines.

It smelled like work.

That was the first warning.

Travancore did not worship men.

It used them.

---

The gate guard looked at me with narrowed eyes.

He was Nair, I could tell from the way he held himself, from the way his spear felt like an extension of his arm. He wore a simple cloth and a waist belt, and his chest was marked with old scars that spoke of service.

"Who are you?" he demanded in Malayalam.

I answered in Marathi first, stupidly, then corrected myself with the few Malayalam words I had learned from the road.

"I have letter," I said, and my accent made the words clumsy. "For Ananthan Pillai."

The guard's eyes flicked to my forehead cloth.

"Fire?" he asked.

The lie almost rose automatically.

Then I remembered my father's letter.

Tell him I died for you.

Lies would not save me here.

"Let me see him," I said, and my voice sounded like begging.

The guard's mouth tightened.

He spat into the mud.

"Wait," he said.

He disappeared into the courtyard.

I stood at the gate and felt the weight of the knife under my belt and the letter against my chest.

The brand on my forehead throbbed under the cloth as if it wanted to announce itself.

The sky darkened further.

Rain began to fall, light at first, then heavier, the first fingers of monsoon.

By the time the guard returned, my hair was wet and my clothes clung to my body.

"Come," he said, grudging.

The gate opened.

I stepped inside.

---

Ananthan Pillai stood near the training yard watching spear drills.

He was older than I expected.

In my father's stories he had been a storm on horseback, a Maratha rider with a blade that cut through Dutch lines and a voice that made men obey.

The man in front of me was grey-haired, his beard trimmed, his shoulders still straight but narrower than they would have been in youth. He wore simple cloth and a light breastplate that looked worn, not ceremonial.

His face was plain.

His eyes were not.

His eyes were the eyes of a man who has watched enough men die that death has become a kind of measurement.

He turned when the guard spoke, and his gaze fell on me.

The cloth on my forehead was wet. It had loosened.

For a heartbeat, the brand showed.

Ananthan's eyes narrowed.

He did not ask about fire.

He knew what a brand looks like.

His gaze dropped to my hands, to the way I held them too close to my body, as if trying to hide blood that was not there.

"Name," he said in Marathi.

The sound of Marathi in this wet green place made my throat tighten.

"Bhalerao," I replied.

Ananthan's face did not change.

"Whose son?" he asked.

I swallowed.

"Dhanaji's," I said.

For the first time, something flickered in Ananthan's eyes.

Not softness.

Recognition.

A man's name can still reach across years.

"Letter," Ananthan said.

I pulled it out with shaking hands and held it out.

Ananthan took it and broke the seal.

He read quickly, eyes moving with practised control.

As he read, the rain thickened.

The spear drills continued behind him, men moving in rhythm, as if my arrival was nothing.

Ananthan finished the letter and looked at me again.

"Where is he?" he asked.

My mouth went dry.

I forced the words out.

"Dead," I said. "He died. Saving me."

Ananthan held the letter loosely now, as if the paper had become heavier.

"Why did he need to save you?" he asked.

The question was simple.

It was also a blade.

I could have lied.

Stable fire.
Bandits.

But the brand on my forehead throbbed like a truth that would not allow lies.

"I killed a priest," I said.

Ananthan's eyes did not blink.

"And?" he asked.

My stomach twisted.

"And the Deshmukh's son," I whispered.

The rain hammered the yard now, loud enough to drown small sounds.

Ananthan's face went still.

Then he spoke.

"Show me," he said.

My fingers found the knife at my belt, slow. Then I pulled it free.

The jeweled knife.

Even in grey light, the stones caught a weak gleam.

Ananthan's gaze locked on it.

The training yard behind him seemed to quiet, as if the men had felt something shift.

Ananthan stepped closer and took the knife from my hand.

He held it the way a man holds a memory.

His thumb traced the hilt.

His eyes lifted to my face.

"You stole this," he said.

It was not a question.

My throat tightened.

"It was my father's," I said, and the sentence sounded pathetic even to me.

Ananthan's mouth tightened.

"It was mine," he said quietly.

The words hit me like a fist.

He did not mean he owned the metal.

He meant the knife carried a bond I had broken by taking it with unclean hands.

He stepped back and looked at the wet cloth on my forehead.

"Take it off," he said.

I lifted trembling fingers and unwound the cloth.

Rain hit the brand directly.

The scar tissue stung. The letters felt alive.

Ananthan stared at it for a long moment.

Then he looked at me with something like disgust.

Not because of the scar.

Because of what it meant.

"You come here with a murderer’s face," he said. "You bring my friend's letter and you bring my knife, and you think I will take you in."

The sentence was not shouted.

It was spoken with the cold precision of a man deciding where to place a gun.

I tried to speak.

I tried to say my father died.

I tried to say I would work.

Ananthan lifted his hand slightly and the words died in my mouth.

"Dhanaji was a good man," he said. "He did not deserve a son like you."

My chest tightened so hard I thought I might vomit.

Ananthan held the knife out toward me.

Then, deliberately, he did not give it back.

He turned and handed it to the guard.

"Put it away," he ordered in Malayalam.

The guard hesitated, then obeyed, eyes flicking to me with something like curiosity and contempt.

Ananthan turned back to me.

"Leave," he said.

The word landed like a death sentence.

I stared at him, rain running down my face, brand burning.

"My father wrote to you," I said, voice breaking. "He said you would remember. He said you owed him."

Ananthan's eyes hardened.

"I do remember," he said. "That is why I am not killing you."

He stepped closer, and his voice dropped.

"Do you know what it means to kill a priest?" he asked. "In this land, it is not only murder. It is defilement. It is a stain that does not wash."

He glanced at my forehead.

"They burned it into you because they wanted you to carry it forever," he said. "And you will."

He leaned in slightly.

"Travancore does not need your stain," he finished.

He stepped back.

"Go," he repeated, louder now.

The guard at the gate took my arm.

Not gently.

He pulled me toward the opening.

I stumbled in the mud.

No one helped.

Men in the training yard kept drilling.

Spears moved.

Feet stamped.

Work continued.

As if my father had not died for me. As if the world had not changed. As if I was nothing.

The gate opened and I was pushed out into the rain.

It slammed shut behind me.

I stood in the mud, bareheaded now, the brand exposed, rain washing over it and doing nothing.

For a moment I considered walking into the backwater and letting the water take me.

It would have been easy.

It would have been clean.

Then I remembered the horse coming riderless out of the dark.

My father had bought my life with his.

If I threw it away, his death would become meaningless.

So I stood at the gate and waited in the rain, not knowing what I was waiting for.

# Chapter 7: Revathi's Gambit

The rain did not stop.

It fell in thick sheets, turning the road outside Ananthan Pillai's gate into a shallow river. Mud swallowed my feet. Water ran into the brand on my forehead and made the scar tissue sting as if the iron had just been pressed there.

The gate stayed closed.

Inside the wall, I could hear life.

Horses stamping.
Men shouting in drill.
A cart wheel creaking.

Work.

Travancore's heartbeat.

Outside, I was a soaked animal with a mark on his face, waiting for a mercy I did not deserve.

I had told myself I was not waiting for mercy.

I was waiting because I had nowhere else to go.

There is no dignity in that.

After an hour, my knees began to shake, not from fear, from exhaustion. Withdrawal had left me hollow. The road had scraped the rest of me raw. Even standing felt like effort.

I slid down against the wall and sat in the mud.

The rain plastered my hair to my forehead.

The brand was fully exposed now.

Let the world see, I thought bitterly. Let it stare until it gets bored.

Then a sound came from the gate.

Not the heavy bar shifting.

Lighter.

Footsteps.

The small click of a latch.

The door in the main gate opened a crack.

An umbrella appeared.

Then a woman's voice spoke from the gap, calm and amused.

"You look like a drowned dog," she said in Marathi.

My head snapped up.

The umbrella tilted, and I saw her face.

She was older than my mother had been when she died, but there was nothing frail in her. Her hair was tied back, streaked with grey, her eyes sharp. She wore cloth draped with the ease of a woman who has never had to apologise for taking up space.

Her gaze moved over me, taking in the brand, the mud, the hollow cheeks, the trembling hands.

She did not flinch.

That was what frightened me most.

"Who are you?" I asked, voice hoarse.

The woman smiled.

"Revathi," she said. "And you are the boy who thinks rain can wash sin."

The sentence hit hard.

I tried to speak.

Revathi lifted her hand slightly, and the attempt died in my throat.

"You have Dhanaji's face," she said, and for a moment something softened in her eyes. Not pity. Memory. "Not the best part of it. But enough."

My chest tightened.

"You knew my father?" I asked.

Revathi's smile returned, thinner now.

"Everyone knew Dhanaji," she said. "He had the annoying habit of doing his duty well."

She looked at the brand again.

"And you," she continued, voice cool, "have the habit of doing the opposite."

I wanted to deny it.

Denial is a luxury I had burned away.

Revathi stepped closer, umbrella covering both of us for a moment. The rain hammered the cloth above my head.

"Why are you here?" she asked.

I swallowed.

"My father wrote a letter," I said. "To Ananthan Pillai."

Revathi nodded as if she already knew.

"He did," she said. "And my husband read it."

Husband.

The word landed with weight.

Revathi was not a servant.

She was not a passing visitor.

She belonged here in a way I never would.

"He told you to go away," I said.

Revathi's eyes glittered with amusement.

"He did," she agreed. "He enjoys telling people to go away. It makes him feel young."

She reached out and, without warning, touched the edge of the brand with one fingertip.

Pain flared.

I jerked back, half anger, half instinct.

Revathi did not move.

"So," she said, "it is real."

Her finger dropped.

"They did not even burn it neatly," she added. "If you are going to disgrace a man, at least do it with craftsmanship."

A laugh bubbled up in me, surprised and ugly.

Revathi watched it and nodded as if she had expected it.

"Good," she said. "You can still laugh. That means you are not dead yet."

She stepped back.

"Get up," she ordered. "And come inside."

My throat tightened.

"He said-"

"He said many things," Revathi interrupted. "He is not the only voice in this house."

The door opened wider.

A guard reached out and grabbed my arm.

Not gently.

He hauled me to my feet.

Revathi turned and walked into the courtyard without looking back, as if assuming I would follow.

My boots stuck for a moment in the mud. Then I stepped through the gate.

The wall shut out the rain's roar, and suddenly the courtyard noise was louder.

Horses.
Men drilling.
Servants moving fast with buckets.

Life.

Revathi led me toward the main hall.

I followed with mud on my feet and death on my forehead.

---

Ananthan waited inside.

He stood in the hall with the letter in his hand, his face carved into cold contempt. The knife I had stolen lay on a low table beside him, wrapped now, not displayed.

He looked at me, then at Revathi.

"What is this?" he asked in Marathi.

Revathi walked past him and sat on a low seat as if the hall belonged to her.

It did.

"This," she said, gesturing toward me with two fingers, "is Dhanaji's son."

Ananthan's mouth tightened.

"This is a criminal," he replied. "This is a priest-killer."

Revathi shrugged.

"Yes," she said. "Travancore is full of criminals if you look closely enough."

Ananthan's eyes flashed.

"Do not make jokes," he snapped.

Revathi's smile vanished.

"Do not pretend you are pure," she replied, voice sharp now. "You were a prisoner once. You were a stranger. You were a man the court wanted dead until the king decided your sword was useful."

Ananthan went very still.

The servants in the hall froze, ears straining.

Revathi leaned forward slightly.

"Dhanaji rode beside you," she continued. "He bled beside you. He became your brother in the only way soldiers become brothers."

Ananthan's jaw worked.

He lifted the letter slightly.

"And now his son comes with a brand and a stolen knife," he said. "He brings defilement to my door."

Revathi's eyes narrowed.

"Your door," she repeated. "Is it your door, Ananthan, or is it ours?"

The word ours hung between them.

Ananthan and Revathi had built a life out of arguments like this, arguments that sounded like hatred to outsiders and felt like intimacy to those inside.

Revathi stood.

She walked to the table and picked up the wrapped knife.

She held it out toward Ananthan.

"This belonged to you," she said. "And you gave it to Dhanaji."

Ananthan's eyes flicked to the knife.

Revathi continued.

"Dhanaji died saving his son," she said. "You can call the boy worthless. You can be right. But the father died anyway."

Her voice lowered.

"Do you want Dhanaji's death to mean nothing?" she asked.

Ananthan's face tightened.

For a heartbeat, I saw something like pain in it.

Then it vanished behind discipline.

"He is not staying," Ananthan said.

Revathi nodded as if she had expected that line.

"He is staying," she replied.

Ananthan took a step forward.

"Revathi," he warned.

Revathi met his gaze without flinching.

"You will not take him as a guest," she said. "You will not pretend he is clean. You will not let him sit in this hall and eat as if he has done nothing."

She turned and looked at me.

"You will work," she said. "You will start at the lowest rung. The stables. The dung. The horses. You will sleep where the horses sleep."

My throat tightened.

Humiliation.

That I understood.

Revathi looked back at Ananthan.

"If he runs," she said, "let him run. If he steals, let him be whipped. If he kills again, let him hang."

Her voice stayed calm.

"But he will not be turned away like a stray dog," she finished. "Not after his father died at a rope for him."

Ananthan stared at her.

Rain drummed on the roof.

Somewhere in the courtyard, a horse snorted.

Finally, Ananthan spoke.

"You are doing this to spite me," he said.

Revathi smiled again.

"Partly," she admitted.

Then she looked at me, and the smile sharpened.

"Mostly," she said, "because I want to see whether a man branded on his forehead can still become useful."

The word useful landed like a chain.

Ananthan's eyes narrowed.

He looked at me one last time.

"If you shame this house," he said quietly, "Revathi will not be able to save you."

I swallowed.

"I do not want saving," I said, and the words surprised me because they were true. "I want work."

Ananthan's mouth tightened.

Revathi's eyes gleamed.

"Good," she said. "Then we understand each other."

She turned and called for the stable master.

The trap had closed.

Not a prison.

Something worse.

A chance.

# Chapter 8: The Lowest Rung

They put me in the stables as if trying to remind me that I was not a man.

Not yet.

The stable floor was packed earth slick with old urine. The air smelled of horse sweat and dung and wet hay. Rats moved in the corners, bold. A horse shifted in its stall and the sound of its hooves on wood was louder than any prayer.

The stable boys looked at my forehead and then looked away quickly, as if the brand might infect them.

One boy, not old enough to shave, whispered the words under his breath as if tasting them.

"Brahmin-killer."

The whisper was not accusation.

It was fascination.

Children are always fascinated by monsters.

That night, lying on a thin mat beside the stalls, I listened to the horses breathe and tried not to think about opium.

Opium is patient. It does not shout. It waits.

It told me, softly, that the stable was a kind of punishment and that punishment should be eased.

It told me that my father was dead anyway, so why should I suffer for his sacrifice.

It told me that the brand on my forehead would never go away, so why pretend redemption mattered.

I lay in the dark and stared at the stable beams until my eyes ached.

Then I forced my mind to a different place.

My father's voice.

Run.

Do not look back.

He had died so I could live.

If I ran back to the paste, I would be killing him again.

So I breathed through the craving, one breath at a time, until exhaustion dragged me under.

---

Morning in the stables begins before sunrise.

The horses need water.
The dung needs clearing.
The tack needs cleaning.

Pride has no place in a stable.

The stable master was an old man named Kannan with arms like rope and eyes like stones.

He looked at me once, taking in the brand, the hollow cheeks, the way my hands shook slightly even without opium.

"You have a strong back?" he asked in Malayalam.

"Yes," I replied, forcing the word out.

Kannan spat.

"We will see," he said.

He handed me a basket and pointed at the dung.

"Clean," he ordered.

No introduction.
No kindness.

Just work.

I bent and began to shovel dung with my bare hands.

The smell hit hard. Heat rose from the pile. Flies swarmed.

I gagged once and forced it down.

If I had been in the Deccan, I would have hit someone for making me do this.

Here, hitting someone would have ended my chance before it began.

Kannan watched for a while, then walked away without a word.

The stable boys laughed quietly.

One threw a pebble that hit my shoulder.

"Priest-killer," he whispered.

I kept working.

My hands moved.

My mind did not.

If I allowed my mind to move, it would move toward rage.

Rage would move toward murder.

So I became hands.

Hands doing work.

---

By midday, my fingers were raw.

The brand on my forehead had dried and cracked at the edges. When sweat ran into it, it stung.

Kannan gave me a clay cup of water and watched me drink as if assessing whether I deserved hydration.

Then he pointed toward a stall where a restless horse was pawing at the ground.

"That one," he said. "The mare. She bites."

I looked at the mare.

She was small but muscular, ears pinned, eyes rolling.

"She does not like strangers," Kannan added, tone flat. "Neither do we."

He walked away.

I approached the mare slowly, palm open, voice low.

Horses understand calm better than they understand words.

The mare snorted, head tossing.

I spoke to her anyway, not in Malayalam, not in Marathi, in the nonsense sounds my father used to make when he wanted a horse to trust him.

Soft clicks.
Low hums.

The mare's ears shifted slightly.

I stepped closer, careful, and reached for the water bucket.

Her teeth snapped at the air, missing my wrist by a finger width.

My heart hammered.

Old instinct rose.

Strike.

Knife.

But there was no knife here. There was only a horse and a bucket and a stable full of watching eyes.

I held still.

The mare snorted again, then lowered her head slightly.

I slid the bucket into place and stepped back.

The mare drank, eyes still wary.

One of the stable boys stared at me with surprise.

He had expected blood.

So had I.

---

The first time I saw Kesava Pillai, I was carrying a sack of feed across the courtyard.

He rode in with two other young men, all of them mounted, all of them dressed like the sons of men who had never known hunger. Their cloth was clean. Their belts were decorated. Their hair was oiled. Their eyes were sharp.

Kesava sat his horse as if he had been born on a saddle.

He saw me and slowed.

His gaze went to my forehead.

The brand was uncovered. Kannan had ordered it uncovered.

"Let everyone see what you are," he had said. "It will make you honest."

Kesava's mouth tightened.

"What is this?" he asked in Malayalam, as if I were a stray animal that had wandered into the yard.

One of the other young men laughed.

"Revathi brought a monster," he said.

Kesava's eyes stayed on my face.

"A Brahmin-killer," he said, and the words came out clean, without fear, without fascination. Only contempt.

I shifted the feed sack on my shoulder and kept walking.

Kesava's horse stepped into my path.

The animal was well trained, obedient. It blocked me neatly.

Kesava looked down at me.

"Do you know where you are?" he asked.

His voice was calm.

That calmness was a kind of cruelty.

"In a stable," I replied in Marathi-tinged Malayalam. "With horses."

One of his friends laughed again.

Kesava's eyes narrowed.

"This is my grandfather's house," he said. "My grandmother's house. You are a stain on their floor."

My chest tightened.

The words were true.

The truth still stung.

"Then do not look at me," I said.

The sentence came out before I could stop it.

The yard went quiet.

Even the stable boys stopped laughing.

Kesava's gaze sharpened.

He swung off his horse in one smooth motion and stepped close.

He was not tall, but he was solid, muscle under cloth, a man built by training.

"You have courage," he said softly. "Or stupidity. It is difficult to tell the difference in a man like you."

He reached up and, with two fingers, touched the edge of my brand.

Pain flared.

I jerked back.

My hands clenched.

For a heartbeat, the old me rose.

The opium man.
The temple robber.
The knife in the dark.

I could have killed him with my bare hands if I chose to.

That thought arrived with terrifying ease.

Kesava saw the flicker in my eyes and smiled slightly.

He wanted me to strike.

He wanted to see the monster prove itself.

My father's voice rose in my mind again, not as command, as memory of consequence.

He had died because I could not control my hands.

I forced my fingers open.

I shifted the feed sack and stepped around Kesava's horse, careful, controlled.

Kesava watched me pass.

"You will break," he said quietly, as if making a prediction about weather. "Men like you always do."

I did not look back.

If I looked back, I might have done what he wanted.

I carried the feed into the stable and dumped it into the troughs with more force than necessary.

The horses lifted their heads, startled.

Kannan appeared in the doorway.

He looked at my face.

"That one?" he asked, meaning Kesava.

I nodded.

Kannan spat.

"He thinks he is a man because his blood is clean," he said. "He will learn."

I stared at him, surprised.

Kannan shrugged.

"This house makes boys into men," he said. "It made Ananthan. It will make him. It might even make you."

Might.

The word was not comfort.

It was a challenge.

That night, lying beside the stalls, my hands throbbing, my stomach hollow with withdrawal, I listened to the horses breathe and thought of Kesava's fingers on my brand.

He wanted me to break.

Everyone did.

It would make their world simpler.

I closed my eyes and forced myself to imagine something harder.

Not breaking.

Becoming useful.

Becoming, somehow, a man who could carry the knife without using it.


# Chapter 9: The Old Dutchman

The first time I went to Udayagiri, I thought I was walking into a story.

In the Deccan, fort stories are always the same. High walls. Cannon. Men shouting and dying on stone steps. Names carved into memory.

In Travancore, Udayagiri felt different.

Not because the walls were higher.

Because the place smelled of discipline.

Discipline has a smell if you have learned to notice it.

It smells like oiled rope and clean iron. It smells like powder stored dry. It smells like men who are paid on time and punished quickly.

It smells like a fort that expects to be tested.

---

Revathi sent me on the errand because she wanted to see whether I would run.

She did not say that.

She said the fort needed horses. She said a message had to be carried. She said a stable hand who could ride without falling off was useful.

Her eyes said something else.

If you run, you die.
If you return, you might become something.

I rode north with a small escort, the road muddy, the air thick. The brand on my forehead drew stares in villages, but in Travancore the stares were different.

In the Deccan, men looked at the brand and saw a crime.

Here, men looked at it and saw an outsider.

Travancore had many outsiders.

Some became soldiers.
Some became corpses.

The fort rose out of green like a stone ship.

Its walls were not the dry brown stone of my childhood. They were laterite and mortar, darkened by rain, with moss clinging to the shaded places. Cannon mouths stared out from embrasures like open jaws.

As we approached, a gun fired on the range.

The sound punched the air.

The recoil echoed off the walls.

My horse flinched and then steadied.

So did I.

I had heard cannon before, from a distance, as background to other men's wars.

Here the cannon sounded like a promise.

Travancore was not a soft kingdom.

---

The gate captain looked at my escort, then looked at me.

His gaze stayed on my forehead longer than was polite.

"Revathi's man," one of the escort said.

The captain nodded.

"Inside," he said.

The gate swallowed us.

Inside, the yard was busy.

Gunners moved around cannon with practised speed, swabbing barrels, checking vents. Powder boys carried charges under cloth, their faces serious. A European-looking man shouted orders in Malayalam that sounded clipped and strange.

Men obeyed him anyway.

That was the first shock.

In the Deccan, foreigners are curiosities.

Here, foreigners gave orders.

The captain led us toward a shaded shed where maps hung on the wall and the smell of chalk mixed with powder.

A tall pale man stood under the eave, his hair grey, his posture still military.

He wore local cloth and a light breastplate.

His face was European.

His eyes were not soft.

He looked at me as if he could see through cloth and skin to the thing beneath.

The captain bowed slightly.

"De Lannoy," he said, using the name as if it were a title.

So this was the old Dutchman.

I had heard the name whispered in markets and stables. The foreign captain who built Travancore's guns. The man who had been enemy once and was now buried in the king's soil, if the stories were true.

He was not Dutch, not really, not in the way my father used the word.

But in Travancore, all Europeans blur into one category.

*Parangi*.

De Lannoy's gaze moved to my forehead.

He spoke to the captain in Malayalam, quick.

The captain answered.

Then De Lannoy looked at me again and spoke in a harsh Portuguese.

"Name," he said.

The Portuguese word struck my ears and slid off. My head was full of Malayalam and cannon and the sick knowledge of my own face.

Then a younger man stepped out of the shed and spoke in Marathi, accent strange but clear.

"He asks your name," the man said.

The younger man was European too, but different from De Lannoy. Darker hair. A face that looked as if it had learned to hide itself. His eyes were the eyes of a man who had spent years staring at iron.

"Bhalerao," I replied.

The younger man translated into Portuguese.

De Lannoy listened, expression unchanged.

He spoke again.

The younger man turned to me.

"He asks about the mark," he said.

I swallowed.

There was no hiding here.

"I killed a priest," I said.

The younger man's eyes flicked to my face, quick.

He translated.

De Lannoy's mouth tightened slightly.

It might have been contempt.

It might have been interest.

He spoke again.

The younger man hesitated, then translated.

"He says," the man began, "that Travancore does not need temple robbers. It needs soldiers."

My throat tightened.

I forced myself to speak before pride could stop me.

"I was a cavalryman's son," I said. "I can ride."

The younger man translated.

De Lannoy's gaze dropped to my hands, to the calluses, to the way I stood near my horse without fear.

He stepped closer.

He did not smell like sweat or spice.

He smelled like leather and old smoke.

He lifted one finger and pointed to my horse.

He spoke.

The younger man translated.

"He says to mount," he said.

My fingers tightened on the reins.

The yard's eyes were on me now.

Gunners paused.
Soldiers glanced.

Revathi had sent a branded stable hand into the fort, and now the foreign captain was making a game of him.

I mounted anyway.

The horse shifted under me, sensing my tension.

De Lannoy walked to the centre of the yard and pointed at a wooden post set in the ground, a target for mounted training.

He spoke again.

The younger man translated.

"Ride to it," he said. "Circle. Come back at speed. Stop clean."

It was not a heroic test.

It was the kind of test soldiers use to separate men who can sit a horse from men who belong to the horse.

I nudged my mount forward.

The yard blurred.

For a moment I forgot the brand.

For a moment I forgot the temple.

There was only the horse and the rhythm of movement and the old muscle memory my father had beaten into me with shouted commands and hard hands.

I rode to the post, circled tight, came back fast, then hauled the horse to a stop without making it rear.

The horse's hooves dug into wet earth.

It snorted once, angry.

Then it stood.

I dismounted and waited.

De Lannoy stared at me.

Then he said something to the younger man in a lower voice.

The younger man translated slowly, as if weighing the words.

"He says you were built for this," he told me. "And you chose opium instead."

The sentence struck harder than any insult.

It was too accurate.

I swallowed.

"Tell him," I said, voice rough, "that I know."

The younger man translated.

De Lannoy watched me for a long moment.

Then he spoke again, quieter, and this time the younger man's eyes shifted, surprised.

"He says," the younger man translated, "that he was the enemy once."

De Lannoy's gaze moved to the wall, to the guns, to the rain-dark stone.

"He says he will die in this soil," the younger man continued. "He says Travancore takes what it needs."

De Lannoy looked back at me.

His eyes held mine, hard.

The younger man finished.

"He says," he translated, "if you stay, the kingdom will take what it needs from you too."

I felt a chill despite the heat.

Taken.

Used.

Remade.

Those were not comforting words.

They were honest words.

De Lannoy turned away, conversation finished.

He spoke to the captain, pointed toward the stables, and the captain nodded.

The younger man remained a moment longer.

"I am Pieter," he said in Marathi, voice quiet.

I stared.

His name was European.

Yet his Marathi was better than mine would ever be.

"You live here," I said.

Pieter's mouth twitched.

"I survive here," he replied.

He glanced at my forehead and then looked away, as if politeness could soften reality.

"Do not think the fort is kinder than the road," he said quietly. "It only kills differently."

Then he turned and followed De Lannoy into the shed.

I stood in the gun yard with mud on my boots and a brand on my face and the sound of cannon still in my ears.

Revathi's message was clear now.

Travancore was not a refuge.

It was a forge.

If I stayed long enough, it would burn away whatever was left of the boy I had been.

And it would keep whatever could be used.

# Chapter 10: Earning the Saddle

Revathi did not promote men with kindness.

She promoted them with danger.

If you survived what she threw at you, you were useful.
If you failed, you were disposable.

I had been in her stables for months by the time the chance came.

My hands had learned the rhythm of Travancore horses. My back had learned the weight of work that never ends. My tongue had learned enough Malayalam to understand insults without translation.

The opium craving had faded into a dull ache, like an old injury that flares in weather.

The brand on my forehead remained.

Some scars fade.

Some are meant to be read.

Kesava still treated me like dirt.

He did not spit.

He did not need to.

He looked through me as if I were a stain on the courtyard floor.

That hurt more than spitting would have.

Then bandits came and made all of us honest.

---

They struck at dusk, when the light turns soft and men begin to believe the day is done.

Revathi's estate kept pepper in a storehouse near the backwater, sacks piled high, guarded because pepper is as valuable as silver when war is near. The guards there were not the king's men. They were Revathi's men. Loyal to her because she fed them and punished them and paid them on time.

Bandits knew that.

Bandits always know where the money sleeps.

The first warning was a shout from the direction of the storehouse.

Then a bell rang, hard and fast.

Stable boys froze with buckets in their hands.

Horses lifted their heads, ears pricked.

Kannan swore and spat into the mud.

"Dogs," he muttered.

Kesava's voice cut through the courtyard.

"To me," he shouted.

Men ran toward the armour rack and spear stand.

I stood for a heartbeat with my hands full of tack and my mind empty.

Then instinct filled the emptiness.

This was what I knew.

Not stable work.

Violence.

I dropped the tack and moved.

Kannan grabbed my arm.

"Stable," he hissed. "Stay."

His grip was hard, warning.

If I ran into a fight and killed again, Revathi's gambit would end with a rope.

I looked at Kannan's hand on my arm.

"If I stay," I said, voice low, "I remain what they think I am."

Kannan's eyes narrowed.

He understood.

He released my arm with a curse.

"Do not disgrace us," he muttered.

I ran to the horse line.

Not to steal.

To borrow, as if the difference mattered.

I grabbed a small grey mare that I had been working with for weeks, the biting one. She snapped at the air as I threw the reins over her neck.

I spoke to her fast, nonsense sounds, the way my father had.

The mare snorted, then stood.

I swung onto her back without saddle.

Someone shouted my name.

Someone shouted priest-killer.

I kicked the mare forward and rode toward the storehouse.

---

The storehouse yard was chaos.

Three bandits had already cut two guards down, their bodies in the mud, blood mixing with rainwater from the last shower. The bandits moved fast, swords flashing, their cloth dark.

More men were coming behind them, dragging sacks toward the water where a small boat waited, hidden in reeds.

They were not desperate thieves.

They were organised.

Kesava had arrived with six guards and a sword in his hand, his face hard with anger. He fought well. I hated him, and I could not deny his skill.

He drove one bandit back with a quick cut to the forearm.

Then another bandit rushed him from the side, spear low.

Kesava turned too late.

The spear point was aimed at his ribs.

My body moved before thought.

I kicked the mare into a short burst of speed and threw myself sideways off her back.

My shoulder hit the bandit like a stone.

We went down together into the mud.

The spear skittered away.

The bandit rolled, trying to bring his sword up.

I had no sword.

I grabbed a broken spear shaft from the ground and drove the splintered end into his face.

He screamed and clawed at his eyes.

I hit him again, hard, until he stopped moving.

Kesava stared at me, breathing hard, sword still raised.

For a heartbeat, his gaze went to my forehead.

I saw the calculation.

Is this man saving me, or hunting me?

Then another bandit shouted and charged.

The moment ended.

Kesava turned and met the charge.

I scrambled up, mud on my hands, heart hammering, and grabbed the spear the bandit had dropped.

The spear felt strange.

It was not a Maratha weapon. It was not a knife.

But it was wood and iron, and it could kill.

I stepped into the fight.

The next minutes became a blur of wet ground, shouting, steel ringing, bodies slipping.

One bandit tried to drag a pepper sack toward the reeds.

I jabbed the spear into his thigh.

He screamed and dropped the sack, hands clawing at the wound.

Another bandit swung at me with a curved blade.

I parried with the spear shaft and felt the impact vibrate up my arms.

The bandit laughed, thinking a stable hand could not fight.

I drove the spear point into his belly.

The laugh cut off.

He folded to his knees, eyes wide, and fell forward into mud.

Behind him, a guard from Revathi's house drove his sword down and finished the man without hesitation.

Bandits are not romantic.

They are problems.

Kesava shouted an order.

"Do not let them reach the boat."

Two guards surged toward the reeds.

The bandits saw the boat escape route closing and began to break.

One threw a knife at Kesava.

The blade struck Kesava's upper arm and stuck there.

Kesava hissed, pain flashing, but he did not drop his sword.

He cut the attacker down with a vicious slash to the neck.

Blood sprayed.

The remaining bandits ran.

Men chased.

The boat in the reeds shoved away, oars digging, trying to escape with two sacks.

I ran into the water up to my knees and hurled the spear like a javelin.

The spear struck the boat's side with a crack and punched through thin wood.

The boat lurched.

One oar snapped.

The men in the boat shouted, scrambling.

A guard beside me fired a matchlock.

The ball hit the water.

The boat kept moving, slower now, dragging.

Kesava's voice shouted again.

"Let them go," he ordered. "We have held the store."

Men stopped chasing reluctantly.

War teaches you that you cannot catch everything.

You catch what matters.

---

After, the yard looked different.

Not because bodies lay in it. Bodies were always possible.

Because the yard had been tested and had not yielded.

The guards dragged the dead bandits into a line. They counted.

Five dead.
Two escaped in the damaged boat.

Two of Revathi's guards were dead.

Kesava's arm bled through his cloth.

He looked at me then, properly, not through me.

His gaze moved from my mud-smeared hands to the spear in my grip to the brand on my forehead.

"You fought," he said.

It was not praise.

It was surprise.

"Yes," I replied.

Kesava's mouth tightened.

"You saved me," he said.

The sentence sounded like a confession he hated making.

"If you died," I said, and my voice was rough, "Revathi would have blamed me."

Kesava stared for a moment.

Then, to my surprise, he laughed once, sharp.

"You have learned Travancore quickly," he said.

He looked at the bandit bodies lined in mud.

"You kill easily," he added.

The words were not admiration.

They were warning.

I did not deny it.

"I have had practice," I said.

Kesava's gaze flicked to my brand.

Then he turned away, as if unwilling to look at the proof.

---

Revathi arrived when the bodies had been dragged and the pepper sacks counted.

She came with two women holding umbrellas over her head and a guard at her side. Her cloth was dry. Her feet did not touch mud.

Power has its own weather.

She took in the scene with one glance.

The dead guards.
The dead bandits.
The damaged boat trail in the reeds.
Kesava's bleeding arm.

Then her gaze fixed on me.

I stood with the spear still in my hand, mud on my clothes, blood on my fingers.

Revathi's eyes narrowed.

"So," she said in Marathi, voice calm, "the dog has teeth."

Kesava stiffened at the word dog.

Revathi ignored him.

She walked toward me and stopped close enough that I could smell perfume under the rain damp.

Her gaze went to the brand.

Then to my hands.

"You did not run," she said.

It was not a question.

"No," I replied.

Revathi nodded.

"Good," she said. "Running is for men who still believe they can escape themselves."

She turned to Kannan, who had followed at a distance, face guarded.

"Move him from the stables," she ordered. "He will sleep with the household guard now."

My breath caught.

Not relief.

Fear.

A stable is humiliating, but it is safe. It keeps you low. A guard post puts a weapon in your hand and eyes on you.

Revathi looked at me.

"Do not mistake this for forgiveness," she said.

Her voice stayed cool.

"A horse is still a horse even if it pulls a chariot," she continued. "You are still what you are."

She gestured toward the dead bandits.

"But you can be used," she finished.

Used.

There was that word again, the word Travancore loved.

Revathi turned away as if the decision was nothing.

Kesava watched her go, then looked at me again.

His eyes were unreadable now.

Not contempt.

Not acceptance.

Something in between.

"If you betray this house," he said quietly, "I will kill you myself."

I nodded.

"If I betray this house," I replied, "I deserve it."

Kesava stared at me for a heartbeat, then shook his head as if annoyed by the answer.

"Come," he said. "We clean. Then we report."

We walked back toward the courtyard together, two men who should have been enemies, bound by a fight in the mud.

I carried the spear like a tool.

For the first time since the temple, I felt the knife in my mind become lighter.

Not because the guilt was gone.

Because I had used my hands for something other than theft.

It was a small difference.

In Travancore, small differences become survival.


# Chapter 11: Lessons

The first time they put a spear in my hand again, my fingers tightened too fast.

Wood and iron. Familiar weight. The old instinct waking, eager. The same hands that had stolen coins from sleeping men now wanted to feel useful steel.

One of Revathi's guards watched the movement and smiled without humour.

"Careful," he said in Malayalam. "That thing bites."

I almost laughed.

So do I, I thought.

But I kept my mouth shut.

Mouths get men killed in Travancore. Swords are safer than words.

---

Moving from the stables to the household guard did not feel like rising.

It felt like being exposed.

In the stables, men looked at my brand and then looked away. A stable has its own shame, and it does not bother borrowing someone else's.

In the guard barracks, men looked at my brand and stared.

They made space around me as if the scar could bleed onto them. They spoke softer when I passed, then louder when my back turned.

"Priest-killer."
"Temple defiler."
"Revathi has a taste for filth."

They did not say it to my face. They did not need to. The letters were on my forehead. The words belonged to everyone.

Kesava Pillai stared at me openly.

Not because he feared me.

Because he wanted me to know my place.

In the yard, Revathi's captains drilled us in the Travancore style.

Footwork on wet ground.
Spears held low, not high.
Shield work, tight and practical.

I had learned to ride in Deccan dust, where hooves kick sand and a man can see an enemy coming from far. In Travancore, the ground was slick, the air thick, the sightlines short. A fight could emerge from jungle in one breath.

You had to be ready before you understood you were in danger.

The drill was meant to build that readiness into the bones.

My body obeyed faster than my pride wanted.

Pride is another addiction.

---

On the third day of guard duty, Ananthan summoned me.

He did not send a servant.

He sent Kesava.

Kesava walked into the barracks with two guards behind him, as if he expected me to leap at his throat.

He stopped in front of my mat and looked down.

"Grandfather wants you," he said.

The word grandfather twisted in me.

Ananthan was not my blood. He was not my elder by any right I had earned. Yet his name carried my father's debt, and debts are thicker than blood sometimes.

I rose and followed Kesava across the yard.

Men turned their heads as we passed.

Kesava did not walk beside me. He walked half a step ahead, marking distance.

We reached the small training space behind Ananthan's hall, sheltered by trees. The rain had eased, but the ground still held water. Puddles reflected the sky in fragments.

Ananthan stood there with a wooden practice sword in his hand.

He wore plain cloth and no armour.

His face was calm.

His eyes were not.

He looked at my forehead first.

Then he looked at my hands.

"Pick it up," he said in Marathi, and he tossed the practice sword toward me.

I caught it.

The wood was smooth, worn by years of hands.

"Stance," he said.

I took a stance I remembered from my youth, from my father's lessons.

Ananthan's mouth tightened.

"That is Deccan," he said. "This is Travancore."

He stepped forward and struck my wrist with his wooden blade.

The blow was not hard, but it was precise. It turned my sword angle slightly. It exposed my ribs.

"Again," he said.

I adjusted.

He struck again, same place, same correction.

After ten strikes, my wrist burned.

After twenty, my pride began to crack.

After thirty, something else replaced pride.

Attention.

Ananthan circled me like a man inspecting a horse.

"You are fast," he said. "Fast is nothing without control."

He stepped in suddenly, wooden blade flashing, and struck my forehead cloth, snapping it loose.

The cloth fell.

The brand was bare.

Kesava stiffened behind me.

Ananthan did not look away.

"That mark will make men want to kill you," he said.

I swallowed.

"Good," I said, and the word came out rough. "Let them."

Ananthan's eyes narrowed.

He stepped closer until I could smell rain on his skin.

"Do not confuse death with courage," he said quietly. "Death is easy. It is a door every man can find. Living is harder."

His wooden blade tapped my chest once.

"Your father chose living for you," he said. "You do not get to choose dying as gratitude."

The sentence hit like a punch.

My throat tightened. I could not speak. My mouth tasted of iron.

Ananthan stepped back.

"Again," he said, as if the conversation had been another kind of drill.

We fought with wood for an hour.

He did not tire.

Old men who have survived wars do not rely on muscle. They rely on timing.

When the hour ended, my arms shook. Sweat ran down my back. My fingers ached from gripping.

Ananthan's breath was steady.

He looked at me for a long moment, then spoke.

"You will train at dawn," he said. "Every day."

I nodded, too tired to react.

"You will not drink," he continued.

I almost laughed.

"I do not drink," I said.

Ananthan's eyes held mine.

"You will not smoke," he said.

The word smoke made my chest tighten.

Opium.

He saw the reaction.

His voice stayed flat.

"If you bring that poison into this house," he said, "I will hang you myself."

I believed him.

I nodded.

Ananthan turned away as if we were finished.

Then he paused.

"Kesava," he said, not looking back.

Kesava stepped forward quickly.

"Yes, Grandfather."

Ananthan's voice cut like a blade.

"Do not touch his mark again," he said.

Kesava froze.

Ananthan turned his head slightly.

"If you want to test him, test his discipline," he continued. "Not his temper. His temper is already known."

Kesava's jaw tightened.

"Yes, Grandfather," he said.

Ananthan walked away into the hall, conversation closed.

Kesava stared at me for a long moment.

"He is wasting time on you," he said.

I picked up the fallen cloth and tied it around my forehead again, fingers careful on the scar.

"He is teaching me to be useful," I replied.

Kesava snorted.

"A priest-killer cannot be useful," he said.

I met his gaze.

"Then why are you afraid I will become one?" I asked.

Kesava's eyes flashed.

He stepped close, too close.

"I am not afraid," he hissed.

He walked away without another word.

---

That night, when the barracks quieted, I lay on my mat and listened to men breathing.

Someone in the corner muttered in his sleep. Someone else snored.

The smell of oil lamps and damp cloth filled the air.

My muscles ached.

My wrists stung where Ananthan had struck them again and again.

Under the ache, the old craving stirred.

Not a scream now.

A whisper.

Just one pipe.
Just one breath.

I pressed my palm against the brand, feeling the raised letters under cloth.

The pain was small.

It was real.

It kept me anchored.

In the dark, I heard my father's voice again.

Not a command.

A memory of his hand on my cheek at the execution ground.

Run.

Do not look back.

I stared at the ceiling until the whisper of opium grew tired and retreated.

Ananthan had been right.

Living was harder.

That was the lesson.


# Chapter 12: The King's Eye

The first time I saw Dharma Raja properly, I understood why men called him pious.

Not because he was surrounded by priests.

Because he looked at the world as if it had to be accounted for.

Most kings look at men as if men are decorations for a throne.

Dharma Raja looked at men as if they were numbers that could save or destroy a kingdom.

That kind of gaze is colder than anger.

Anger burns and passes.

Attention stays.

---

Revathi took her household guard to Padmanabhapuram for a court ceremony, the kind that brings nobles and merchants and priests into the same space and forces them to smile.

I went because I was told to.

No one asked if I wanted to stand in a palace courtyard with a brand on my face.

Wanting is for clean men.

We rode in with Revathi's palanquin at the centre, guards on either side, umbrellas held above her like a moving canopy. The road was slick. The palace gates rose out of green, tall and painted, guarded by soldiers with spears and matchlocks.

Inside, the courtyard smelled of sandalwood, warm oil lamps, and sweat trapped under silk.

Men bowed.
Women watched from shaded balconies.
Priests murmured.

I stood with the other guards near a pillar, trying to make my body look smaller than it was.

It did not help.

The brand made sure of that.

Ananthan was there too, not close to Revathi, not far. He wore plain cloth and looked like a man who would rather be anywhere else.

Kesava stood beside him, posture stiff, eyes scanning.

When Kesava's gaze found me, his mouth tightened.

He did not look away.

He wanted the court to see that he was not associated with the stain.

Then Dharma Raja entered.

No drums.
No dramatic announcement.

He walked in with a small escort, his cloth simple, his posture straight. He looked younger than I expected, but his face carried the tiredness of a man who has spent too many nights listening to reports that smell of smoke.

His eyes moved through the courtyard and took everything in.

Not admiring.

Measuring.

I felt the gaze pass over Revathi like a hand, then over Ananthan, then over Kesava.

Then it landed on me.

For a heartbeat, the courtyard sound faded.

The king's eyes held my forehead.

The brand.

The raised letters.

The shame burned into flesh.

I felt my stomach twist and my hands go cold.

The instinct to bow too low rose in me.

The instinct to flee rose too.

I did neither.

I stood still and let the king look.

Dharma Raja's gaze did not change.

No disgust.
No anger.

Only curiosity, sharp and calm.

He shifted his gaze to Ananthan.

He spoke in Malayalam, quiet enough that only those close heard.

Ananthan replied in the same low voice.

I did not hear the words.

I saw the exchange.

Dharma Raja asked a question.
Ananthan answered.

The king looked at me again.

Then he looked away as if my brand was a line in an account book that had been noted.

The ceremony continued.

Priests chanted.
Nobles bowed.
Merchants smiled.

I stood with sweat running down my spine and felt a strange sensation.

Not relief.

Recognition.

The king had seen me.

He had not flinched.

That was worse than flinching.

It meant I was now part of the kingdom's calculations.

---

After the ceremony, Revathi received audience in a smaller room where decisions were made without incense.

She took Kesava and two guards with her.

Not me.

The brand was useful in the yard, as a warning and a spectacle.

It was not useful near a king's breath.

So I waited outside with the other guards and watched courtiers move like fish through water.

A Brahmin priest passed and his gaze caught my forehead.

His face tightened.

He stepped closer, robe brushing the stone.

"How does a temple defiler stand in a king's courtyard?" he hissed in Malayalam.

The question was not for an answer.

It was for humiliation.

My hands clenched.

I forced them open.

I remembered Ananthan's lesson.

Control.

The priest leaned in.

"Your shadow defiles the stone," he whispered.

His breath smelled of betel and superiority.

I stared at him and said nothing.

Silence is a weapon too.

The priest's lip curled.

"You think you can be remade?" he murmured. "Stone does not change its nature."

Then a voice cut in, sharp and amused.

"Stone changes every monsoon," Revathi said.

She stood in the doorway, her audience finished, her umbrella bearer behind her.

The priest stiffened.

"Lady," he began, bowing, trying to wrap his insult in respect.

Revathi smiled without warmth.

"If his shadow offends you, stand in the sun," she said.

The priest's face tightened.

Revathi leaned closer, her voice lowering.

"The king needs walls," she said. "Walls are built by men. Men are never pure."

The priest swallowed and backed away, bowing again.

Revathi turned to me.

Her eyes flicked to my brand, then to my hands.

"Do not touch priests," she said softly.

It was not kindness.

It was instruction.

"They scream louder than soldiers when they bleed," she added.

Then she walked past me as if the conversation had never happened.

Kesava emerged behind her, face tight, eyes flicking to the priest, then to me.

He did not speak.

He did not need to.

He was angry at Revathi for defending me.

He was angry at me for existing.

We rode back from Padmanabhapuram under a grey sky.

I kept hearing the king's silent gaze in my mind.

It had not offered forgiveness.

It had offered a question.

What do we do with a man like this?

I did not know the answer yet.

I only knew that Travancore had noticed me.

That is how a kingdom begins to own you.


# Chapter 13: Brothers

Kesava Pillai became my brother in the only way men like us become brothers.

Not with vows.

Not with shared meals.

With blood and breath and a moment when you realise the man beside you is the difference between living and dying.

It happened on a road north of the estate, in scrub country where the jungle begins to thicken and the air tastes of iron.

We were riding patrol, six horsemen, ordered to investigate reports of raiders taking cattle from villages near the border.

Raiders are usually bandits.

Sometimes raiders are scouts.

Sometimes they are a kingdom's fingers testing how soft you are.

We did not know which this was until we saw them.

---

The village was quiet when we arrived.

Too quiet.

Huts stood with doors open. A pot lay on its side in the mud, rice spilled, already pecked by birds. A goat bleated from somewhere unseen, a thin desperate sound.

Kesava raised his hand and we halted.

He slid off his horse and crouched, fingers touching the ground.

He looked up at me.

"Tracks," he said.

His voice was calm.

It was the calm of a man who has learned that panic is contagious.

He pointed at the mud near a hut.

Hoof prints.

Not local.

The pattern was too neat, the spacing too controlled.

These were not village ponies driven by hungry thieves.

These were cavalry mounts.

Kesava's eyes narrowed.

"Mysore," he muttered.

The word made my stomach tighten.

I had heard it spoken in court like a distant disease.

Here it sat in mud and silence and spilled rice.

Kesava signaled two men to circle left and two right.

He looked at me.

"With me," he ordered.

It was the first time he had said it without contempt.

We moved through the huts toward the back of the village where a narrow path led into scrub.

A woman lay on the ground near the path, face turned away, cloth torn.

Kesava's jaw tightened.

He did not stop.

In war, stopping can kill the living.

We followed the path.

The scrub thickened.

Then a matchlock fired.

The sound cracked through the air.

The ball struck a tree trunk near Kesava's head and buried itself in wood with a dull thud.

Kesava dropped instantly, body moving before thought.

I dropped too.

Another shot cracked.

One of our men behind us screamed and fell.

Ambush.

Not bandits.

Scouts with discipline.

Kesava hissed.

"Back," he whispered. "Draw them out."

He was trying to pull us out of the kill zone.

The kill zone did not want to let us go.

Two riders burst out of the scrub on our left, swords raised.

Kesava rolled and came up with his spear.

The first rider swung down.

Kesava parried, the spear shaft vibrating with impact.

The second rider aimed for Kesava's ribs.

I did not think.

I lunged and drove my spear into the second rider's horse, low in the chest.

The horse screamed and collapsed, throwing the rider into the mud.

The rider tried to rise.

Kesava's spear point flashed and went into the man's throat.

Blood bubbled.

Kesava's face was still.

No triumph.

Only necessity.

The first rider wheeled away, startled by the horse collapse, and shouted something in a tongue I did not know.

More movement in the scrub.

Three more riders, then four, appearing and disappearing like ghosts in green.

Kesava signaled our men to form a loose line, not a cluster.

"Spread," he shouted. "Do not bunch."

I understood without understanding.

Even I had learned that neatness is death when fire falls from the sky.

We spread.

The Mysore scouts fired matchlocks again, aiming at the places men would have stood if we had been foolish.

They were learning.

So were we.

Kesava shouted another order, and our men fired back, not in volley, in controlled individual shots.

One Mysorean rider toppled off his horse and disappeared into scrub.

Then the scouts charged.

Close work.

Steel and hooves and breath.

The world narrowed to the sound of my own blood in my ears and the weight of the spear in my hands.

I saw a rider's sword flash toward my face.

I raised the spear shaft and felt the blade bite into wood.

The impact numbed my fingers.

I shoved forward and drove the spear point into the rider's shoulder.

He screamed and fell sideways, dragged by his own horse.

Another rider came for me.

Kesava cut across and took the rider's horse by the bridle, yanking it off line.

The rider's sword missed me and struck air.

I drove my spear into the rider's belly.

He folded over the point and made a wet choking sound.

When I yanked the spear back, blood sprayed warm on my hands.

My stomach turned.

I kept moving anyway.

Kesava fought like a man who had never been an addict, never been a thief, never been a stain. His motions were clean. His breath controlled. He did not waste effort.

He was everything I was not.

And still, he was fighting beside me.

That was the strange truth of battle.

It does not care who you were.

It cares whether your hands obey you now.

Our men on the flanks surged in, the two riders Kesava had sent earlier returning at the right moment, spears lowered.

The Mysore scouts hesitated.

Hesitation is death.

One of our riders caught a Mysorean in the back with a spear thrust and the man tumbled off his saddle.

The remaining scouts pulled away into the scrub, retreating fast, disciplined even in withdrawal.

They did not run like bandits.

They withdrew like men who expected to return.

Silence fell again, broken by heavy breathing and the moan of a wounded horse.

Kesava stood in the mud, chest rising and falling.

He looked at the dead in the scrub and then at our fallen man, the one shot in the ambush.

The man still breathed, shallow. Blood seeped from his side.

Kesava knelt and pressed cloth to the wound with practised hands.

He looked up at me.

"Help," he snapped.

No insult.

No contempt.

Only command.

I knelt and pressed my hand harder.

The blood was warm.

The wounded man whimpered.

Kesava's eyes stayed on the man's face.

"Do not die," he muttered, as if the words could hold the life in.

Then Kesava looked at me again.

The gaze was different now.

Not contempt.

Not hatred.

Recognition.

"You saved me," he said quietly.

I swallowed.

"I saved myself," I replied, and the sentence came out rough.

Kesava's mouth twitched.

"Yes," he said. "That too."

He rose, wiping blood on his cloth.

He looked north, toward scrub that had swallowed the scouts.

"They are testing us," he said.

I nodded.

Kesava's gaze flicked to my brand.

For a heartbeat, I expected the old contempt to return.

It did not.

"Do you know why my grandfather trains you?" he asked suddenly.

My tongue felt thick in my mouth.

"Because Revathi forced him," I said.

Kesava shook his head slightly.

"He hates being forced," he said. "He would rather burn the house down."

Kesava's voice lowered.

"He trains you because he thinks you can hold," he said.

Hold.

The word sounded like a prayer.

Kesava looked back at the wounded man.

"If you break," he said, "men will die."

I felt the sentence settle in my chest like weight.

"Then I will not break," I said.

Kesava stared at me for a long moment.

Then he nodded.

We lifted the wounded man onto a horse and rode back toward the estate.

The sky was darkening again.

Rain was coming.

Mysore scouts were in the scrub behind us, carrying their own report.

And beside me rode Kesava, no longer looking through me.

In Travancore, that was as close to brotherhood as a man like me could hope to earn.

# Chapter 14: The Knife's Weight

The jeweled knife came back to me in silence.

No ceremony.

No forgiveness wrapped around it.

Just metal and stones and the weight of what it had cost.

---

Ananthan summoned me after dawn drill, when my wrists still ached from wooden practice and sweat still clung to my back.

He did not summon Kesava.

That alone made my stomach tighten.

Ananthan's hall was cool and dim. Oil lamps burned low. The air smelled of old wood and dried flowers, the smell of a house that has learned to keep its emotions quiet.

Ananthan sat on a low seat with a cloth map spread beside him.

The knife lay on the table, unwrapped.

The stones caught lamplight and threw it back in small hard gleams.

My throat went dry.

Ananthan did not look at the knife first.

He looked at my face.

"Do you still crave it?" he asked.

I blinked.

For a heartbeat I did not understand.

Then I did.

Opium.

The craving flared in me at the word, like a wound pressed.

I forced my hands to stay open at my sides.

"Yes," I admitted.

Ananthan nodded.

"Good," he said. "A man who lies about hunger lies about everything."

He tapped the table once with his finger.

"Sit," he ordered.

I sat on the floor near the table, the way a servant sits. Not across from him like an equal.

Ananthan watched me for a moment.

"Do you know what a knife is?" he asked.

I almost laughed.

"A weapon," I said.

Ananthan's eyes narrowed.

"It is a choice," he corrected. "A man draws it when he cannot solve a problem with his mouth."

The sentence struck.

My mouth had failed me at the temple.

My mouth had failed me at the execution ground.

My mouth had failed me every time I chose the quick solution.

Ananthan's gaze flicked to the knife.

"This knife," he said, "was given in friendship."

He looked at me again.

"You took it in theft," he continued.

My chest tightened.

"It was my father's," I said, and the defence sounded weak even as I spoke it.

Ananthan's voice stayed flat.

"Your father never stole it," he said. "That is the difference between you and him."

The words cut clean.

I swallowed.

"I know," I whispered.

Ananthan leaned forward slightly.

"Then say it properly," he said.

I stared at the floor.

The lamplight made the wood grain look like scars.

My throat tightened.

"I stole it," I said.

The words tasted of bile.

Ananthan nodded.

"Good," he said again.

He lifted the knife and held it out toward me.

I did not take it.

My hands stayed frozen.

Ananthan's eyes narrowed.

"Take it," he ordered.

I forced my hand to move.

My fingers closed around the hilt.

The knife was heavier than I remembered, as if the years and the guilt had added weight to the metal.

Ananthan watched my grip.

"Do not draw it in anger," he said.

I nodded.

"Do not draw it to impress," he continued.

I nodded again.

"Do not draw it to punish a priest who insults you," he added, and for a moment I heard amusement under the hardness.

I felt heat rise in my neck.

Ananthan's gaze stayed sharp.

"If you draw it, know why," he finished. "And know the cost."

He tapped my forehead cloth lightly with two fingers.

"Your face is already a cost," he said. "Do not add to it without purpose."

My grip tightened on the knife.

I wanted to say thank you.

The words stuck.

Ananthan did not look like a man who wanted thanks.

So I did something else.

I reached into my shirt and pulled out my father's letter.

The paper was worn at the folds. The wax seal had long been broken, but I had kept it like a relic.

I held it out.

Ananthan stared at it for a moment.

"Why?" he asked.

My throat tightened.

"Because it is his voice," I said. "And I have nothing else."

Ananthan took the letter and held it as if it might burn him.

He did not open it.

He already knew what it said.

He looked at me and spoke quietly.

"A father can die for a son," he said. "That does not make the son clean."

I nodded, because that truth had become my shadow.

Ananthan handed the letter back.

"Keep it," he said. "Read it when you want to be weak."

Weak.

The word did not insult me in his mouth.

It sounded like another piece of doctrine.

Ananthan leaned back.

"Go," he said.

I rose, knife at my belt, letter against my chest, and walked out of the hall.

The yard was bright with daylight now. Men were drilling. Horses were being watered. Life continued.

I found a quiet corner near the stables and unwrapped the knife again.

The stones glinted.

My father had carried this knife as a symbol of friendship.

I had carried it as stolen loot.

Now I carried it as something else.

Not inheritance.

Debt.

I pressed my thumb to the hilt and felt the small raised pattern where Nagoji's hand had once rested.

The knife was not a weapon.

It was a reminder.

Every time I drew it, I would be drawing my father's death too.

That weight did not make me noble.

It made me careful.


# Chapter 15: The House of Velinadu

Revathi Bayi's house was a battlefield without blood.

Men fought there with seating.
With smiles.
With who spoke first and who was forced to wait.

I had grown up in the Deccan where power is loud. Men shout. Men boast. Men kill to prove a point.

In Velinadu, power was quieter.

Quieter power is more frightening.

It leaves no obvious enemy to stab.

---

Revathi took us to Velinadu when she wanted the court to remember she still mattered.

Her palanquin moved along the backwater roads, guards on either side, umbrellas above, servants behind. The land was lush, the air heavy with damp heat. Coconut palms leaned over water like men listening to secrets.

Velinadu was not a fort.

It was an estate, a cluster of halls and courtyards surrounded by pepper vines and rice fields, guarded by men loyal to Revathi, not the king. Women moved through corridors with practised calm, carrying trays, carrying messages, carrying knowledge.

Kesava walked differently here.

Not stiff with duty.

Comfortable.

This was his grandmother's world.

It belonged to him the way my father's house had belonged to me once, before I burned it with my choices.

Revathi received visitors all day.

Nair lords from nearby lands.
Merchants with spice-stained fingers.
Temple officials with oil on their foreheads and arrogance in their eyes.

They bowed.

They smiled.

They offered gifts that were really questions.

How strong are you now?
How weak is the king?
How much does the Company know?

I stood behind Revathi's seat with the other guards and tried to look like a wall.

Walls do not react.

Walls only hold.

It was harder than spear drill.

A man can swing steel honestly.

He cannot swing his face.

A merchant stepped forward once, a thick man with rings on his fingers and pepper dust in the folds of his cloth.

He bowed to Revathi and spoke in Malayalam with a smile that looked friendly.

"Lady," he said, "there are rumours from the north. Hyder's men are moving again."

Hyder.

The name sat on the air like smoke.

Revathi's face did not change.

"Rumours are always moving," she replied.

The merchant smiled wider.

"Then Travancore will need powder," he said.

Powder.

He said the word like prayer.

Revathi's eyes flicked to him, sharp.

"Travancore always needs powder," she said. "Travancore also needs honest merchants."

The merchant's smile tightened.

He bowed again and stepped back.

Revathi turned slightly, as if adjusting her seat.

Her voice dropped, meant only for those close.

"Men sell fear like spice," she murmured.

Kesava's jaw tightened.

Revathi's gaze flicked to me.

"Remember that," she said quietly. "Do not buy fear. Make others buy yours."

I swallowed.

It was a lesson, not in combat, in power.

Later that day, a temple official entered, a Brahmin with sharp forehead marks and a mouth that looked permanently displeased.

He bowed, but his eyes slid past Revathi to my face.

The brand.

His lip curled.

"Lady," he said, voice dripping with sweetness, "your household has gained interesting servants."

Revathi smiled, as if delighted.

"Yes," she replied. "I collect interesting things."

The Brahmin's eyes narrowed.

"A man marked as a priest-killer should not stand in a holy house," he said.

Holy house.

He meant Revathi's hall.

He meant the land.

He meant the world.

My hands clenched.

I forced them open.

Revathi's smile did not change.

"Do you see him standing in your temple?" she asked gently.

The Brahmin stiffened.

"No," he said.

"Then your temple is safe," Revathi replied.

The Brahmin's mouth tightened.

Revathi leaned forward slightly, and her voice, still gentle, sharpened.

"If the king needs his sword," she said, "the priests will find a way to tolerate the man holding it."

The Brahmin's face flushed.

He bowed too quickly.

Revathi's eyes glittered.

"Tell your friends in the temple council," she added, as if making conversation, "that Travancore's walls are not built with prayers alone."

The Brahmin backed away.

When he was gone, Kesava hissed.

"You enjoy this," he muttered.

Revathi glanced at him.

"Yes," she admitted. "It keeps me young."

Then she looked at me.

"And it teaches you," she said.

I stared, confused.

Revathi's voice lowered.

"They will always try to make your brand into their weapon," she said. "If you react like an animal, you give them the weapon. If you stand still, you turn their disgust into their own humiliation."

She leaned back.

"Power is often nothing more than patience," she finished.

That night, as I lay on a mat in Velinadu's guard quarters, I stared at the ceiling and thought about patience.

Patience had saved Ismail Khan's caravan.
Patience had saved me from opium more than once.
Patience had kept my hands from Kesava's throat.

Perhaps patience was the weapon my father had tried to teach me and failed.

In the morning, Revathi sent me with Kesava to deliver messages to a nearby fort commander, a small task meant to show me the shape of her network.

On the road, Kesava rode beside me in silence for a long time.

Then he spoke, voice grudging.

"You did not react," he said.

I glanced at him.

"To the Brahmin?" I asked.

Kesava nodded.

"Most men would have," he said.

I swallowed.

"I have reacted before," I replied. "It killed my father."

Kesava's jaw tightened.

He looked away toward the backwater.

"Do not make me feel sorry for you," he muttered.

I almost laughed.

It was a strange thing to say to a man with a brand on his face.

But I understood what he meant.

Pity is another way of looking down.

So I kept my voice flat.

"Then do not," I said.

Kesava's mouth twitched.

"Good," he replied.

We rode on.

In Velinadu, I had learned a new kind of lesson.

Not how to strike.

How to endure being watched.

How to let other men show their ugliness first.

Revathi's house was a battlefield.

And patience was the blade.


# Chapter 16: The North Smells of Smoke

War announces itself long before banners appear.

It arrives as refugees with cracked feet.
As merchants with anxious smiles.
As a price that rises without explanation.

It arrives as a smell.

Smoke on the wind, faint at first, then impossible to ignore.

---

Revathi sent Kesava and me north with a small patrol to inspect border villages and deliver messages.

It was not an honour.

It was work.

Work that kept us out of her hall and out of Ananthan's patience for a while.

We rode for days through green country that grew wilder as we moved north. The backwater channels narrowed. The coconut groves thinned. Jungle pressed closer to the road like men eavesdropping.

Villages became smaller.

Huts were built with quicker hands, as if people expected to abandon them.

In the first village, an old woman grabbed my sleeve when she saw my brand.

Her fingers were thin, strong.

"You," she whispered in Malayalam. "You are cursed."

I did not pull away.

"Yes," I replied.

Her eyes widened at the honesty.

She leaned closer.

"Then you will understand," she said. "The north is cursed too."

Kesava stepped in, annoyed.

"What are you talking about?" he snapped.

The old woman pointed toward the trees.

"Smoke," she said.

There was no smoke in the sky.

Only cloud.

Only green.

But I smelled it then, faint, mixed with damp leaves.

Not a kitchen fire.

A different kind of burning.

We reached a village two days later that had been raided.

Not destroyed.

Tested.

A cattle pen was empty. A shed was blackened. Two huts had scorch marks where fire had licked and then been smothered by rain.

A boy sat on a threshold staring at nothing.

Kesava dismounted and questioned the headman.

The headman spoke quickly, eyes flicking around.

"Horsemen," he said. "Not bandits. Disciplined. They took cattle and left. They fired something that screamed."

Screamed.

Kesava's jaw tightened.

He looked at me.

He did not ask what screamed.

He already knew the stories.

We rode on.

That night, we camped near a small stream and listened to insects and distant thunder.

One of our men, a young spearman, spoke softly.

"Hyder Ali," he said.

The name fell into the night like a stone into water.

Kesava stared into the fire.

"A soldier who became a ruler," he said, voice flat. "A man who drills his army like Europeans."

He spat into the fire.

"A man who uses rockets," he added.

The young spearman shivered.

I stared at the flames and felt my stomach twist.

Rockets.

I had not seen one.

I had heard men describe them in whispers, as if describing a demon.

Screaming iron.
Fire falling from the sky.

My hands tightened around the knife at my belt.

The knife felt small.

A knife is personal.

Rockets are not personal.

They kill whoever stands in their way.

The next day we met refugees on the road.

Not a camp. Not a crowd.

A line of people moving south with bundles on their heads and exhaustion in their faces.

Women with babies.
Men with nothing but walking sticks.
Children who did not play.

They saw our horses and stepped off the road quickly, eyes down.

Kesava raised his hand.

"Stop," he ordered.

He dismounted and approached an old man at the edge of the line.

"Where are you going?" Kesava asked.

The old man looked up, eyes red.

"South," he said.

"Why?" Kesava asked.

The old man swallowed.

"Because they burned the granary," he said. "Because they took my nephew. Because they said the land belongs to Mysore now."

Kesava's face went hard.

"Who said?" he demanded.

The old man pointed north with a trembling hand.

"Hyder's men," he whispered.

Kesava turned away, jaw tight.

I watched the refugees and felt something settle in my chest.

This was not a raid.

This was pressure.

Hyder was squeezing the land, making people move, making fear travel ahead of his army.

We escorted the refugees for a while, not out of kindness, out of calculation. If bandits hit them on the road, the corpses would become rumours that would reach Travancore faster than any dispatch.

On the second afternoon, a boy in the refugee line stared at my brand for a long time.

Then he asked, voice small, "What does it say?"

His mother slapped his head, hissing for silence.

The boy looked down, ashamed.

I stared at him.

In the Deccan, children had whispered the words like they were tasting poison.

Here, this boy asked like a man trying to understand a map.

"It says what I did," I replied.

The boy's eyes widened.

"Did you kill a priest?" he whispered.

I nodded.

The boy swallowed.

"Then you are not afraid," he said.

The sentence shocked me.

Not afraid.

If he knew the truth, he would know how afraid I was.

Afraid of my own hands.
Afraid of my own weakness.
Afraid of the past catching me.

I looked at the boy and spoke quietly.

"I am afraid," I said. "Every day."

The boy stared, then nodded slowly as if the answer made sense.

Fear teaches children faster than any parent can.

When we left the refugee line at the edge of Travancore's patrol range, Kesava rode in silence for a long time.

Then he spoke, voice low.

"This is only the beginning," he said.

I looked north and smelled the faint smoke again.

It was not in the air.

It was in the mind.

That night, back at the estate, Revathi listened to our report without changing expression.

When Kesava finished, she tapped her finger once on the arm of her seat.

"Hyder is a fire," she said. "Tipu will be a wind."

Kesava frowned. "Tipu?" he asked.

Revathi's eyes glittered.

"A fire's son is always worse," she said.

She looked at me.

"Do you smell it now?" she asked.

I swallowed.

"Yes," I replied.

Revathi nodded.

"Good," she said. "Then you will not be surprised when it reaches our walls."

I went to the yard that night and stood near the stables, listening to horses breathe.

The knife at my belt felt heavier than before.

Not because it had changed.

Because the world had.

The north smelled of smoke.

And Travancore, sooner or later, would have to breathe it in.


# Chapter 17: Refugees

By the time Tipu's name began to travel south in earnest, I had learned that war does not arrive first as an army.

It arrives as paperwork.
It arrives as empty granaries.
It arrives as rumours that make men sleep with a hand on a knife.

Then it arrives as people.

---

The first column I saw came down the northern road in the grey light before sunrise.

At a distance it looked like a procession, the way villagers move for a festival, bundles balanced, children clinging, old men leaning on sticks. Then the wind shifted and carried the smell to me.

Smoke, old and ground into cloth.
Fear-sweat that no bath can wash.
Rot from wounds kept wrapped too long.

They had walked for days. Some had walked without shoes. Their soles were split and caked with mud the colour of dried blood. A woman carried a cooking pot on her head and a baby at her hip, and the baby did not cry. A man with a shaved crown and a strip of cloth tied around his arm walked like a sleepwalker, eyes on nothing.

When they saw our horses, the line faltered.

Not because they were relieved.

Because soldiers meant decisions made by men with weapons.

Kesava rode up beside me, posture straight as if that could keep chaos at arm's length.

"Open the ground," he ordered our men. "Water first. Then food. No pushing."

Our small post was nothing but a watch hut, a ditch, and a few palm trunks set as barriers. We had been placed there to spot raids and carry messages. We had not been built to swallow a river of people.

I stared at the column and felt a familiar discomfort crawl under my skin.

Refugees look at you the way a hungry dog looks at a kitchen door. Not begging. Measuring the chance of being kicked.

They stopped at the edge of our ditch and waited.

The ones in front were Syrian Christians, *Nasrani*, their crosses visible on cords at their throats. Some clutched palm-leaf bundles as if they were sacred. One man carried a battered wooden crucifix like a standard, the Christ figure chipped and dark with soot. Behind them were Hindus from the same villages, and behind them again a scatter of Muslims who looked as afraid as anyone else. Tipu's armies did not only burn what was convenient. They burned what resisted.

An old priest stepped forward, beard white, eyes bloodshot from smoke and sleeplessness. A small silver cross hung against his chest, dull in the morning light.

He took one look at my forehead and stopped as if he had hit a wall.

The brand was not fresh anymore. Years had given the scar tissue a darker, rougher texture. But the letters still announced themselves.

BRAHMIN-KILLER.

The priest swallowed.

He did not make the sign of the cross.
He did not spit.
He did not flinch away.

He simply looked tired.

"We need water," he said in Malayalam that carried a coastal accent. His voice cracked on the word, as if even asking was painful.

Kesava nodded to a man with a bucket.

I dismounted and walked forward, slow, hands open.

When you move too fast around people who have fled soldiers, your speed becomes another weapon.

The first child who drank from our pot vomited the water back up. It was not disgust. It was the stomach of a body that had learned to brace for hunger.

The mother wiped the child's mouth with the edge of her sari and looked at me as if she expected me to punish her.

I looked away.

Shame is contagious. It spreads from the guilty to anyone who stands too close.

---

We opened the ground beside the road and began to build a camp out of whatever we had.

Palm fronds for shade.
Rope for crude lines.
Two sentries at the edge so that fear did not become a riot.

The first day we fed them rice from our stores and watched the line lengthen with every hour.

On the second day, Raja Kesavadas arrived with clerks, porters, and a face that looked carved from calm.

He was not dressed like a warrior. White cloth. Clean hands. The kind of man who could decide whether a village lived or starved by moving ink across paper.

He stood beside me and watched a woman clean a wound on her husband's thigh with water that would not be clean enough.

"How many?" he asked.

I did not know the exact number. I knew the weight.

"Too many," I said.

Kesavadas nodded, as if that was an acceptable measurement.

He gestured toward the column still arriving.

"They are bringing stories," he said. "I need the stories separated from the panic. Panic spreads faster than fever."

He said it the way a man speaks of weather.

I watched the refugees' faces and thought of my own panic, years ago, on a road south, sickness sweating out of me, hunters behind me, the brand burning under cloth.

"What happened up there?" I asked.

Kesavadas looked at me.

Not at my brand. At my eyes.

"Tipu is taking Malabar," he said quietly. "Not only land. People. He wants the coast obedient. He wants the trade obedient. He wants faith obedient."

He nodded toward the crosses.

"Some villages refused," he continued. "Some men fought. Some priests refused to bend. The response was what you would expect from a ruler who believes God has signed his orders."

The temple stones in my own village came back to me, slick with blood, my knife in my hand. I saw the priest's face, shocked, not angry, only surprised that Dhanaji's son could fall so far.

Kesavadas spoke again.

"They are deporting people inland. Forced marches. Conversions. Those who resist are made examples."

He paused, eyes on a boy carrying a younger sister, her head lolling with fever.

"And now they are coming here," he finished. "Because Travancore still has walls."

Walls.

Even the word tasted like responsibility.

Kesavadas turned to the clerks.

"Names," he said. "Villages. Occupations. Languages. We cannot feed everyone forever, but we can decide who can help feed the rest."

He looked back at me.

"You," he said, matter-of-fact. "You have seen hunger and you have seen violence. You will keep this camp from turning into a stampede."

It was not praise.

It was assignment.

In Travancore, that is what passes for trust.

---

By the third day, the camp smelled like human bodies pressed too close.

Sweat.
Rice water.
Damp cloth.
Smoke that had travelled south on skin.

In the afternoon, a merchant arrived with ox carts laden with sacks.

He was thick-necked, well fed, dressed in good cloth that had travelled through many hands. A gold chain lay against his chest. His servants moved with the alertness of men who had been beaten before and wanted to avoid it happening again.

He greeted Kesavadas like an equal, which told me more than his jewellery.

Then he looked at me and smiled.

"Balan Pillai," he said, using the name Travancore had given me, the name that tried to cover what my face could not. "You look like a man who knows what a starving crowd can do."

"I know," I replied.

He nodded, satisfied.

"Thomman Mappila," he introduced himself. "Pepper. Cardamom. Credit. These are my weapons. Yours are sharper, but mine pay for yours."

His Malayalam was smooth and coastal. He slipped Portuguese words into it without noticing, like a man who had learned to speak to factories as easily as he spoke to temples.

He gestured toward the sacks.

"Rice," he said. "And dried fish. Not charity. Investment. If these people die, the north becomes empty, and empty land becomes Mysore land."

I stared at him.

He did not blink.

This was the first time I understood something my father had known and I had ignored. War is paid for long before it is fought.

Thomman leaned closer.

"One more thing," he said. "Among the refugees are women who can read and men who can count. Use them. Do not waste useful hands."

He glanced at my forehead, only briefly.

Then he added, almost casually, "And do not let them hang you in their minds for what is written there. They have enough ghosts already."

He walked away to speak with Kesavadas.

I watched him and felt something like resentment.

Some men carry their sins on paper.
Some carry them on skin.

---

That evening, after the sun went down and the campfires came up, I walked the edge of the camp with Kesava.

He watched the refugees with the discomfort of a man seeing the kingdom's future as a problem he cannot stab.

"This is how Tipu fights," he muttered. "He does not only attack walls. He attacks the stomach."

A woman began to sing softly near one of the fires.

It was not a lullaby.

It sounded like prayer.

The words were not Malayalam.

They were older, shaped by churches and ships and a coast that had been trading with the world before the Marathas learned to ride south.

I stopped without meaning to.

The voice was low and steady, as if the singer had decided that if she could not control anything else, she could at least control sound.

Kesava followed my gaze.

In the firelight I saw a woman kneeling beside a child, her hands moving over the child's ribs, checking for breath. Her hair was braided tight. Her face was thinner than it should have been, but her eyes were sharp.

She looked up and met my stare without flinching.

Most people look at the brand and then look away.

This woman looked at it as if it was simply another fact, like weather or hunger, and then looked at my eyes as if that was the part that mattered.

Kesava nudged my arm, irritated.

"Do not stare," he whispered.

I did not answer.

The woman's gaze held mine for a heartbeat longer, then she looked back down at the child and continued her work.

In the dark, with smoke in my nose and the sound of prayer in my ears, I felt a strange certainty.

The north had finally reached us.

And it had brought a face I would not be able to forget.

# Chapter 18: Mariam

In the morning, the camp looked worse.

Night gives refugees a thin mercy. Darkness hides the scale of the ruin. At dawn, the light returns and shows you what you are expected to manage with buckets and prayers.

Children with fever.
Old men who had stopped eating.
Women with blood on their skirts and no explanation offered.

The smell had settled into everything. Smoke, sweat, damp cloth, the sourness of bodies that have been hungry too long.

Kesavadas's clerks arrived with palm-leaf bundles and reed pens.

"Names," one of them said to the camp, voice forced into authority. "We need names. We need villages. We need numbers."

The refugees stared at him.

They did not trust numbers. Numbers are what soldiers use when they decide you are expendable.

Kesava elbowed me. "Help them," he muttered, meaning the clerks, not the refugees.

I walked into the camp and felt eyes track my forehead like fingers.

BRAHMIN-KILLER.

It was a sentence that never ended.

---

The woman from the firelight was standing near the water pots when I reached her.

She was distributing ladles of rice water with the briskness of someone who refused to let misery become theatre. Two boys carried the pot between them, shoulders straining. She did not waste motion. A ladle, a hand, a nod. Next.

When a man tried to push forward, she slapped his wrist with the ladle hard enough to make him yelp.

"Wait," she snapped in Malayalam. "You will not steal from children."

The man glared at her, then looked past her at me and saw my uniform.

His anger shifted target like a dog switching from a stick to a throat.

He opened his mouth.

She turned her head slightly and said one word, quiet but sharp.

"Enough."

The man shut his mouth.

It was not fear of me.

It was fear of her.

I watched her for a moment longer than I should have.

She looked up, met my gaze again, and raised her eyebrows as if asking whether I had come to drink rice water too.

I stepped closer.

"Who put you in charge?" I asked.

Her eyes flicked to my forehead.

Then to my boots.

Then back to my eyes.

"Hunger," she replied. "Hunger promotes people quickly."

One of the clerks approached, waving his palm leaf.

He spoke to her as if she was another item to be counted.

"Name," he demanded. "Village. Family."

She did not answer him.

She looked at me instead.

"Is he your dog?" she asked.

The clerk stiffened.

I kept my voice flat. "He is doing what the *Dalawa* ordered."

"And what did the *Dalawa* order you?" she asked.

The question was not defiance for its own sake.

It was assessment.

I realised then that she was doing the same thing I had learned to do on the road south. Reading men. Measuring what they would do when pressed.

"To keep this from turning into a riot," I said.

She nodded, as if approving the answer.

Then she turned back to the clerk.

"Mariam," she said, clipped. "From near Palakkad. My family is dead or scattered. Write that. It will save you time."

The clerk blinked, thrown off by directness.

"Father's name?" he insisted.

Mariam's jaw tightened.

For a moment I saw something raw under the discipline, like a wound uncovered.

"Do you want his name so you can summon him back from Mysore?" she said. "Or do you want it so you can feel useful?"

The clerk flushed.

I stepped between them, not threatening, simply occupying space.

Mariam's eyes did not drop. She watched me as if waiting to see whether I would turn my size into violence.

I had done that once.

Not again.

"Write Mariam," I told the clerk. "Write Palakkad. Write that she speaks Malayalam and Portuguese."

The clerk stared at me, annoyed at being corrected.

"How do you know she speaks Portuguese?" he snapped.

Mariam answered before I did, voice cool.

"Because the Portuguese factories are the reason my people learned it," she said.

The clerk opened his mouth, then shut it again when he realised he had no response that would not sound like an insult.

He wrote.

Mariam turned back to the pot and resumed ladling rice water as if the conversation had been a fly she had brushed away.

---

When the line thinned, I stayed.

Not because I was fascinated by her work. I had seen women work in every camp and every village. Work is what poor people do while the powerful make speeches.

I stayed because she did not behave like a refugee.

Refugees apologise for existing. They fold themselves small so that soldiers will not notice them.

Mariam took up space like a woman who expected the world to make room.

"You do not bow," I said finally.

She gave a small humourless smile.

"I bowed enough on the road," she replied. "It did not save anyone."

I nodded, understanding more than I wanted to.

I leaned on the edge of the water pot and watched her hands.

They were steady.
Not delicate.
Not trembling.

Hands that had lifted bodies.

"What did you see?" I asked.

Her ladle paused mid-air.

The camp's noise went on around us, children coughing, men arguing quietly, a baby finally crying as if remembering it was alive. But in that moment there was a silence around her.

"You are a soldier," she said. "You already know what I saw."

"I know what soldiers do," I replied. "I want to know what was done to you."

She stared at me for a long moment.

Then she said, "They burned the church first."

Her voice remained controlled, but the words were heavy.

"Not because they needed the wood," she continued. "Because they wanted the smoke to rise and tell the villages around us that resistance has a smell."

I felt my fingers tighten on the pot rim.

She kept speaking.

"They gathered the men in the yard. They asked who would take the new faith. Some did. Some refused. They made the refusals public."

She glanced away for the first time, eyes on the ground, and I saw that looking away was not weakness. It was restraint.

"My father argued with an officer," she said. "He spoke too long. He believed words still mattered."

She looked back at me.

"They killed him in front of us," she finished. "Then they told us to walk."

Walk.

The word carried everything.

"Where?" I asked.

She shrugged slightly.

"North," she said. "Away from the sea. Away from our churches. Away from the pepper. Away from anything that could remind us we had once been people and not cattle."

I stared at her.

In my mind I saw the road south I had walked, sick and hunted, but my misery had been of my own making. No army had marched me at spear point.

Mariam continued.

"Some escaped," she said. "Some were helped by Muslims who did not want Tipu's men in their villages either. Some were helped by Hindus who would not abandon neighbours. Some were helped by thieves who smelled profit."

She smiled again, bitter.

"Mercy has many faces," she said. "So does greed."

I found myself nodding.

She watched me and then said, quieter, "What does it feel like, having it written on your face?"

The question did not come with disgust.

It came with curiosity, almost clinical.

I touched the scar tissue without thinking. The letters were rough beneath my fingers.

"It feels like heat," I said. "Even when there is no fire."

Her eyes narrowed.

"Did you do it?" she asked.

I could have lied.

But the brand has its own discipline. It makes lies pointless.

"Yes," I replied.

Mariam studied me, and I waited for the recoil, the judgement, the polite step back.

Instead she nodded, as if confirming a detail in a story.

"Then you know," she said.

"Know what?" I asked.

She lifted the ladle and poured rice water into a child's hands.

"What it is to be marked," she said. "What it is to have no clean way back."

I felt something shift in my chest.

The camp was full of marked people, but most marks were invisible.

Hers had been burned into memory.

Mine had been burned into skin.

Kesava called my name from the edge of the camp, impatient.

I turned my head.

"Coming," I replied.

When I looked back, Mariam was watching me again.

"If you want to keep this camp from becoming a riot," she said, voice low, "you will need more than soldiers."

"What do you mean?" I asked.

She gestured toward the line of refugees.

"You will need someone who can speak to them without sounding like a threat," she said. "Someone who can translate fear into instructions."

I stared at her.

She stared back.

Then she added, almost as if daring me to refuse, "And someone who can count without turning people into numbers."

I looked at the clerks with their palm leaves, at the guards with their spears, at the children with their hollow faces.

Then I looked at Mariam.

"Come to Kesavadas's tent," I said. "We need you."

Her mouth tightened, suspicious.

"Need is a dangerous word," she said.

"So is hunger," I replied.

For the first time, her expression softened by a fraction.

"Fine," she said. "But understand this, soldier. I will not be grateful for crumbs. I will work for what keeps people alive. If your king uses me like a tool, I will bite."

I should have been offended.

Instead, I felt a strange relief.

Tools that bite are harder to break.

# Chapter 19: Father Thomas

The first dead refugee we buried in Travancore was a girl with a braid still neat.

She could not have been more than twelve.

Her feet were swollen, her lips cracked, her skin hot with fever even after she stopped breathing. Her mother sat beside the body and combed the braid again and again, as if order could be forced back into a child by repeating a familiar gesture.

Kesava told me to move the body before the camp saw it and began to panic.

He was not cruel.

He was practical.

Panic kills more than fever.

I went to the edge of the camp with two men and dug into damp ground with spades borrowed from farmers. The earth was heavy, dark, clinging. Kerala soil holds water the way grief holds memory.

When we returned for the body, the mother was still combing.

An old priest stood behind her.

He was small and thin, his cassock patched, his beard white and wiry. A cross hung at his chest, and his hands were stained with earth as if he had already been digging graves before we asked.

He watched me approach.

He did not look at my uniform first.
He looked at my forehead.

BRAHMIN-KILLER.

He read it without moving his lips, then lifted his eyes to mine.

I expected disgust.
I expected fear.
I expected the flinch that always came after recognition.

Instead he said, in Malayalam softened by age, "You will carry her gently."

It was not a request.

It was instruction.

I found myself nodding.

We lifted the girl's body onto a cloth and carried her through the camp. People turned to watch, and their faces tightened, as if seeing a dead child made the road behind them real again.

The priest walked beside me, murmuring a prayer in a language I did not know. The syllables sounded old, older than Portuguese, older than Dutch. Like something that had washed up on this coast and decided to survive.

At the grave, he stopped.

He looked at the mother.

"We will not pretend," he said quietly. "We will not say God wanted this. We will say the world is cruel and we will ask God to meet her in a place that is not."

The mother made a sound that was not a sob. It was too deep for that.

The priest glanced at me again.

"You," he said. "Help me lower her."

I did.

When the first clods of earth hit the cloth, the sound was dull and final.

The priest made the sign of the cross.

Then, to my shock, he placed his palm on the ground above the grave and whispered something that sounded like blessing.

I stared at his hand, brown and veined, fingers stained with soil.

I had killed a priest once.

I had never touched a priest since.

Now one stood beside me and used me like a tool.

---

After the burial, he found me washing mud from my hands at the water pots.

Mariam stood nearby, speaking to Kesavadas's clerk in rapid Malayalam, translating complaints into lists. She glanced at the priest and dipped her head in respect.

"Father," she said.

So this was the priest the refugees had been following.

He looked at her with something like affection, then looked back at me.

"You are the one with the scar," he said, as if describing a burn, not a crime.

The words tightened my stomach.

"Yes," I replied.

"And you are the one who digs," he added.

It was almost a compliment.

Mariam's mouth twitched, the ghost of a smile.

The priest turned slightly and addressed me in a slower Malayalam, the way one speaks to a man who is not fully of this coast.

"My name is Thomas," he said. "Father Thomas, if titles comfort you."

"They do not," I replied.

"Good," he said. "Then we can speak plainly."

He nodded toward the camp.

"These people are tired," he said. "They will become angry. They will become sick. They will fight over food because food is the only power they have left."

He looked at my forehead again.

"You have fought," he said, statement not question.

"Yes," I replied.

"Then you know this," he said. "A crowd can be a weapon. And a weapon can turn in the hand."

His eyes were not accusing.

They were warning.

I found myself answering with the truth.

"I know," I said. "I have been hunted by crowds."

Father Thomas nodded, satisfied.

"Then you understand refugees better than most kings do," he said. "Kings think people are loyal. Refugees know loyalty is hunger with a story attached."

He said it the way a priest says scripture.

Thomman Mappila approached then, wiping sweat from his forehead with the edge of his cloth.

"Father," Thomman greeted, then looked at me. "And the soldier."

Father Thomas made a small gesture with his hand.

"This is Balan Pillai," he said.

The name still sounded like clothing I had not fully worn in.

Father Thomas continued, "He is cursed, but he works."

Thomman raised his eyebrows.

"Cursed men are useful," he said. "They do not pretend the world is clean."

Mariam shot Thomman a look.

"Do not speak like that," she said. "You make pain into a proverb."

Thomman shrugged, unoffended. "Pain pays for pepper," he replied, and walked off to shout at porters.

Father Thomas watched him go.

"He is not wrong," he said quietly. "He is only unkind in the way merchants are."

Then he looked at me again.

"Why do you stay here?" he asked.

The question landed harder than it should have.

I could have said duty.
I could have said the king.
I could have said I had nowhere else to go.

All of those were true.

None of them were enough.

I wiped my hands on my cloth slowly.

"Because my father died so I could run," I said. "And I am tired of running."

Father Thomas studied me.

Then he said, almost gently, "And do you think staying makes you forgiven?"

The words scraped.

I felt heat rise under the scar tissue, as if the brand still burned.

"No," I said. "I do not believe in forgiveness."

Father Thomas nodded as if hearing something familiar.

"Good," he said. "Forgiveness is cheap when it is offered by men who never paid your price."

He stepped closer, and for the first time I smelled incense on him, faint, mixed with sweat.

"Listen to me," he said, voice low. "God does not ask which army you rode with. He asks what you did when you dismounted."

I stared at him.

It was a strange thing to hear from a priest, and stranger still from a priest speaking to a man branded for killing one.

I waited for him to add an accusation.

He did not.

He simply looked past me, toward the camp, toward the children with fever, toward the men whose eyes had gone flat.

"If you want to build something that survives," he continued, "then you do not begin by asking for clean hands. You begin by feeding the hungry and keeping the strong from preying on the weak."

He nodded toward Mariam.

"She is doing that," he said. "Use her well. Do not make her beg for respect."

Mariam pretended not to hear, but her shoulders shifted slightly.

Father Thomas turned his gaze back to my forehead.

Then, without flinching, he reached up and touched the edge of the scar tissue with two fingers.

The contact made my whole body stiffen.

I did not pull away.

Father Thomas's touch was not blessing.

It was examination, like a doctor testing whether a wound has healed.

"Fire leaves marks," he said quietly. "Sometimes the mark is the point."

He lowered his hand.

"Do you still crave the black paste?" he asked.

The question startled me.

Mariam's eyes snapped to my face.

I realised in that moment that she did not know the full shape of my ruin. She knew the brand. She did not know the hunger behind it.

I swallowed.

"Yes," I admitted. "Some days."

Father Thomas nodded as if that was expected.

"Then stay away from it," he said. "Not because it is sin. Because you are already a man who knows what weakness costs. Do not make your weakness into other people's grave."

The words were harsh.

They were also true.

He stepped back, leaving me with the sting of honesty.

Then he turned to Mariam.

"Come," he said. "We have more dead to bury before the sun takes them."

Mariam nodded and followed him without looking at me.

I watched them walk through the camp, a priest and a woman carrying grief like work.

For the first time in a long time, I felt something close to reverence.

Not for gods.

For people who kept moving when the world tried to stop them.


# Chapter 20: A House of Their Own

Love did not arrive in me like a poem.

It arrived like a bruise.

Slow.
Unwanted.
Tender when pressed.

I had spent years learning how to be hard. Travancore rewarded hardness. It gave you rank for it, land for it, a place in a hall for it. Hardness kept you alive when rockets screamed and men died in mud.

Love made a different demand.

It demanded that I stay soft in one place.

---

Mariam remained in the refugee camp long after the first wave had been resettled.

Kesavadas kept her close because she was useful. She could speak to Portuguese-speaking factors without bending. She could read accounts without pretending they were holy. She could translate grief into lists, and lists into orders.

Men like Kesavadas love people like that. Not because they are kind. Because they are rare.

At first I told myself I stayed near the camp because Kesava ordered it.

Then I told myself I stayed because Father Thomas needed guards when tempers rose.

Then I stopped lying.

I stayed because Mariam looked at my face as if the brand was not the only story written there.

When she spoke to me, she did not speak like a supplicant.
When she laughed, it was sharp, but real.
When she was angry, she did not hide it behind politeness.

She made my own careful hardness feel like cowardice.

One evening, after a day of arguments over rice stores, I found her sitting on an overturned basket outside Thomman Mappila's storehouse, rubbing her wrists as if the bones themselves ached.

Thomman's porters were loading sacks by lamplight, the air thick with the smell of pepper and sweat. A clerk argued over weights in rapid Malayalam.

Mariam watched it all with the tired focus of someone who had learned to stay awake by force.

"You look like you want to hit someone," I said.

She did not smile.

"I do," she replied. "I want to hit all of them. The Mysore men. The clerks. The merchants. The priests. God, if he is watching."

I sat beside her on the basket.

The wood was rough under my palms.

I said, "God is watching."

She looked at me sharply.

"Do not start preaching," she warned.

I snorted.

"I am the last man who should preach," I said.

Her gaze went to my forehead.

Then to my hands.

"Yes," she agreed quietly.

The agreement should have stung.

Instead it felt like relief.

No pretending.

For a long moment we sat in silence, listening to porters grunt and sacks thud onto carts.

Mariam spoke without looking at me.

"When you first spoke to me," she said, "I hated you."

"I noticed," I replied.

Her mouth twitched.

"You have a talent for understatement," she said. Then she added, softer, "I hated you because you were a soldier, and soldiers were the ones who made my father die."

I stared at the ground.

"And now?" I asked.

Mariam's fingers pressed into her wrist as if testing pain.

"Now I know soldiers are not one thing," she said. "Some burn villages. Some carry dead children. Some stand in the way so that others can run."

I felt my throat tighten.

She continued, voice flat with exhaustion.

"I do not forgive the world," she said. "But I can choose where to place my trust. Even if it is a small trust."

I turned my head and looked at her properly.

The lamplight caught the hollows under her cheekbones. Smoke had stained the ends of her braid even after weeks in Travancore. She looked older than her years, the way famine makes children look old.

I said, "I am not worth trusting."

Mariam looked at me, and for once her eyes held no humour.

"Then become worth it," she said.

It was the most intimate thing anyone had ever demanded of me.

---

When I told Kesava, he reacted as if I had announced I planned to poison the king.

"A Christian?" he hissed, in the privacy of the stable yard. "A refugee?"

He paced like a caged animal.

"Do you want to make enemies of every temple in Travancore?" he demanded. "Do you want to make enemies of her people too? They will call her a whore for touching you. They will call you a dog for touching her."

He stopped and jabbed a finger toward my forehead.

"You already wear one crime on your face," he snapped. "Do you want to add more?"

His anger was not only disgust.

It was fear.

Kesava had grown up inside the kingdom. He believed in its rules the way a fish believes in water.

I said, "I am already outside."

Kesava stared at me.

"You think you are outside," he said, voice low. "You are inside enough to be killed for embarrassing the wrong priest."

He turned away, shaking his head.

"She will not thank you for dragging her into your shame," he muttered.

"I am not dragging," I replied.

Kesava looked back at me, eyes hard.

"Then why are you doing this?" he asked.

I did not have a clean answer.

I had never had clean answers.

I said, finally, "Because I want something to protect that is not only the king's banner."

Kesava stared at me for a long time.

Then he exhaled, defeated.

"Then do it properly," he said. "If you must break the world, at least do it with ceremony."

---

Revathi surprised me.

When I approached her with the request, I expected laughter, or contempt, or a lecture about foolish men and their appetites.

She listened without interrupting, eyes half-lidded as if bored.

When I finished, she tapped her finger once on the arm of her seat.

"A Syrian Catholic girl," she said. "From the smoke."

"Yes," I replied.

Revathi's gaze flicked to my forehead and lingered.

"And a man with burned letters on his face," she added. "Travancore collects strange objects."

I did not know whether to be insulted.

Revathi smiled, small and sharp.

"Do you think you are the first man in this kingdom to love outside his permission?" she asked.

I kept my face blank.

Revathi leaned forward slightly.

"Ananthan married me when he was still called Nagoji by men who hated him," she said. "The priests found ways to bless what they wanted to condemn, because kings always need swords."

She waved a hand.

"The Syrians will complain," she continued. "The Brahmins will complain. The Nairs will whisper. Let them. Complaints do not stop a house from being built."

She looked at me directly.

"Do not ask me for approval," she said. "Ask me for what you actually need."

I swallowed.

"A priest," I said. "And protection from the priests who will try to make this into a riot."

Revathi nodded.

"Father Thomas will marry you," she said. "He has more sense than most men in robes."

"And the Brahmins?" I asked.

Revathi's smile turned colder.

"A Brahmin will perform something from a distance," she said. "Not because he believes you are clean. Because he believes I am dangerous."

The way she said it made it sound almost like mercy.

It was not.

It was leverage.

---

The wedding was small, because large weddings invite spectators, and spectators invite stones.

Father Thomas chose a chapel that was barely a chapel, a whitewashed room with a wooden cross and a lamp that smoked because the oil was poor. A bell hung outside that had once been Portuguese. It rang with a thin, sad sound.

Mariam stood before the cross in a plain sari, hair braided, eyes steady. A small silver cross lay against her throat.

I stood beside her in my uniform because it was the only clothing that gave me legitimacy, and because if I dressed like a villager, the villagers would remember what I had been.

My forehead was uncovered.

If I was going to be shamed, I would not be shamed by hiding.

Father Thomas began the prayers in Syriac, the old words flowing like water over stone. I understood nothing, but I felt the weight of the sound. It was a language that had survived empires by refusing to die.

When he switched to Malayalam, I understood enough.

He asked Mariam if she chose this.

"Yes," she said, voice clear.

He asked me if I chose this.

I looked at Mariam, then at Father Thomas.

The priest I had killed flashed in my mind. So did the brand. So did my father dying in the dust so I could run.

"Yes," I said.

Father Thomas looked at my face for a long moment.

Then he said quietly, for my ears only, "Do not make this woman carry your ghosts."

I nodded.

He placed a thin cord in Mariam's hand and then in mine, tying our wrists together.

Not chaining.

Binding.

Mariam's skin was warm against mine.

For a moment I felt something I had not felt since childhood.

Safety.

It was terrifying.

Outside, thunder rolled, distant.

Kerala always threatens rain when you try to pretend your life is stable.

After the chapel, Revathi had arranged a separate ritual in her courtyard, a Brahmin chanting from a distance, refusing to look at my face directly. He did not touch me. He did not touch Mariam. He threw rice into the air as if trying to keep his hands clean by never letting grain rest on skin.

It was absurd.

It was also, in Travancore, enough.

When the chanting ended, Revathi stood and regarded us as if judging livestock.

"At least he chose someone with spine," she said, loud enough for the priests to hear.

Mariam's mouth tightened, but her eyes glinted.

"Thank you," she replied, tone polite in a way that was not submission.

Revathi laughed once, delighted.

---

We built the house with our own money and other people's labour.

That is the truth of every house.

Thomman sold me timber at a price that was almost kind.

Kesavadas arranged land that sat close enough to the backwaters for trade and far enough from the main temple road to avoid daily insults.

Kesava sent men, grumbling but loyal, to help raise walls.

We used laterite brick that bled red when cut. We used jackfruit wood for beams, its fresh sap sticky on the hands. The air smelled of wet earth, sawdust, lime, and the faint sharpness of pepper from Thomman's sacks.

Mariam supervised the workers like a commander.

She argued with masons.
She counted bricks.
She refused to let men cheat us because they assumed a soldier did not understand building.

I watched her and felt something tighten in my chest.

This was not romance.

This was partnership.

When the roof went on, we stood under it and listened to rain drumming on palm thatch.

The sound was steady.

It made the world feel far away.

Mariam reached up and touched the scar tissue on my forehead with her fingertips, gentle.

The gesture made my skin prickle.

"It will never go," she said quietly.

"No," I replied.

She looked at me.

"Then we will build around it," she said.

Outside, beyond our new walls, the kingdom still trembled under the smell of smoke.

But inside, for the first time since Sangamner, I had a place that belonged to me.

Not because it was clean.

Because it was chosen.

# Chapter 21: The Lines

In late 1789, Travancore did not answer Tipu with speeches.

It answered him with earth.

With ditch and rampart.
With sharpened stakes.
With men sweating in mud until their hands blistered and their backs broke.

Kings can be pious. Ministers can be clever. But when an army comes, the land itself must be persuaded to fight.

That was what the Lines were.

Persuasion made visible.

---

The *Nedumkotta* ran like a scar across the north, cutting the gap between the hills and the sea. In some places it was a wall of laterite, in others a high earthen rampart faced with stone. In front of it was a ditch deep enough to swallow a horse. Behind it were gun platforms and firing steps, places where men could stand and keep their heads low until it was time to kill.

It was not a single wall so much as a system. More than fifty kilometres of ditch and rampart, from the coastal flats into the Ghats. The ditch was six metres deep and five metres wide, a wound that could swallow men and ladders and still look hungry. Twenty bastions broke the line. Behind them, every three kilometres, there was a camp site and a well, because a wall is only as strong as the men who can eat, drink, and stay at it.

I rode it for weeks with Kesava, checking posts, speaking to captains, listening for the small problems that become disasters.

Mosquitoes rose from the ditch in clouds.
Leeches clung to ankles when the rain came.
The air smelled of wet earth and sweat and the faint sourness of fear.

On the wall, men hammered stakes into the top, the points angled outward like teeth. They worked with the grim focus of men who knew they might soon need to look down and see those teeth bloodied.

Hendrik De Lannoy met us at one of the main gun platforms.

He was older than the Pieter I had met years ago, and harder. Pieter had carried iron in his eyes. Hendrik carried obligation.

He greeted Kesava formally, then looked at me.

His gaze went to my forehead, stayed there, then moved on as if he had decided he did not have time for judgement.

"Your cavalry patrols are late," he said without greeting.

Kesava bristled.

"The road is mud," he snapped. "We are not cannon that can be dragged by oxen."

Hendrik did not smile.

"Mud does not stop rockets," he replied.

He turned and pointed toward the ditch.

"Tipu's scouts have been seen in those trees," he said. "Twice this week."

His voice remained calm, but his fingers tapped once on the gun carriage.

Nervousness disguised as precision.

I stepped closer to the parapet and looked north.

The jungle was thick, green, innocent as a priest's lie.

Somewhere inside it, men were watching us and measuring our wall.

I could not see them.

But I could feel them the way a man feels eyes on his back in a crowded market.

Caspar arrived late, as if punctuality offended him.

He came up the ramp with a rolled plan under his arm and mud up to his knees, laughing at something a labourer had said.

He looked at me and grinned.

"Balan Pillai," he greeted. "Still breathing. That is progress."

He slapped the wall with his palm.

"This," he declared, "is going to make Tipu furious."

Kesava muttered, "He will be furious enough to kill us."

Caspar's grin widened.

"Yes," he said, as if pleased. "At least the end will be interesting."

Hendrik's mouth tightened.

"Do not speak of death like it is a joke," he said.

Caspar shrugged.

"Death is never a joke," he replied. "That is why men laugh at it. If we did not laugh, we would lie down in the ditch and let the mosquitoes finish us."

I watched the brothers.

Hendrik looked like a man trying to hold a fort together with discipline.
Caspar looked like a man trying to hold himself together with fire.

They were both, in their own way, desperate.

---

The Lines were not only stone and earth.

They were politics.

Every village asked who would feed the labourers.
Every temple asked whether the wall would protect its idols.
Every Syrian church asked whether the wall would protect its crosses.

Mariam went north with me once, stubborn, refusing to remain in the safety of our new house while men built a barrier that would decide whether she lived.

She stood on the rampart in the rain, sari soaked, hair plastered to her neck, and watched labourers dig.

"They are making a grave," she said quietly.

I did not answer.

A man digging a ditch can pretend it is only a ditch.

A woman who has walked behind an army knows better.

That night, in a tent that smelled of damp canvas, I told her to go south.

Not as a request.

As an order disguised as love.

"If the wall falls," I said, "I want you away from the road. I want you near the sea, where you can flee by boat."

Mariam stared at me.

Her eyes were not angry.

They were insulted.

"Do you think I will survive by running again?" she asked.

"You survived once," I replied.

She leaned forward, voice low so that the guards outside would not hear.

"I survived because I learned when to run and when to bite," she said. "Do not turn me into a bundle you can throw onto a boat."

I felt heat rise in my face.

Not the brand's heat.

The heat of being seen.

"I do not want you to die," I said, and the words came out rougher than I meant.

Mariam's expression softened by a fraction.

"Then build a wall that holds," she said simply.

Then she added, almost gently, "And understand this, husband. I married you because you stopped running. Do not ask me to run so you can pretend you protected me."

I stared at her in the dim light and realised something that frightened me more than Tipu's scouts.

This woman was not my weakness.

She was my mirror.

---

Tipu did not strike the Lines in a single clean moment. He tested them for half a year, sending rockets as warnings and scouts as questions, while his sappers learned the ground and our labourers kept piling earth as if earth could outrun fear.

The first rockets we heard were far away.

Not seen.

Heard.

A thin screaming sound in the north, like metal tearing.

Men on the rampart froze, heads turning toward the jungle.

Hendrik lifted a hand, calm.

"Test shots," he said, as if explaining an exercise. But his knuckles were white on the parapet.

Caspar laughed once, sharp.

"He wants us to know he has them," he said. "He wants the sound to enter our dreams."

Kesava spat over the wall.

"Let him scream," he said. "We have guns."

Hendrik looked at him.

"Guns need powder," he said. "Powder needs dry storage. Dry storage needs roofs. Roofs leak in monsoon."

He said it with the dull fury of a man fighting nature while waiting to fight men.

I watched labourers haul baskets of earth and felt my stomach twist.

Walls are slow to build.

Fear is fast.

When the messenger arrived from the north, mud up to his thighs and terror on his face, I knew the wall had run out of time.

"Tipu is coming," he panted.

He did not need to say it.

The air already smelled of smoke.

# Chapter 22: Breach

The night Tipu hit the Lines, the frogs went silent.

In the hours before the assault, the ditch had been alive with sound. Croaking. Insects. The constant wet whisper of jungle breathing.

Then, as the sky darkened and the rain held its breath, even the frogs stopped.

Men noticed.

Soldiers will laugh at omens in daylight, but at night they listen.

---

I was stationed behind the central section with my cavalry, not on the wall itself.

Cavalry is useless on a rampart. A horse cannot climb a firing step. A rider cannot lean over parapet stone and shoot down into a ditch without turning into a target.

Our job was to be the fist behind the shield. If the wall held, we would ride out through the gates and cut down stragglers. If the wall cracked, we would move to plug the crack before it became a mouth.

Kesava was posted two miles east with another troop. Hendrik and Caspar were on the gun platforms, their crews ready, powder protected under cloth, matchcords kept dry in tins.

I walked the inner road behind the wall and listened.

I could hear men whispering in the dark.
I could hear the clink of a ramrod against iron.
I could hear the soft scrape of sandals as labourers tried to sleep in trenches they had dug.

On the parapet above me, a sentry cleared his throat.

Then a sound rose from the north, thin and rising, like a kettle left too long on fire.

The first rocket.

It arced over the jungle canopy, a line of orange flame against black cloud, and slammed into the ditch with a crack that shook the earth.

Men shouted.

Then the second rocket came.

Then the third.

Then, like a choir finding its voice, the screaming multiplied until the air itself seemed to tear.

Tipu wanted us to understand.

The wall would not only be climbed. It would be burned.

---

"To the wall," I ordered, and my men moved, not running, not panicking, simply obeying.

That was what Ananthan had beaten into us. Panic is a luxury. Discipline is survival.

We reached a gap between gun platforms where the inner road rose slightly and gave a view over the parapet.

I climbed the firing step and looked out.

The ditch was full of smoke.

Not the slow smoke of kitchen fires.

Gun smoke, sulphur sharp, layered with the oily stink of rockets.

Shapes moved in it.

Tipu's infantry, disciplined, dark figures with shields and ladders, running in waves.

Behind them, men with tools.

Sappers.

They carried baskets, ropes, bundles of brushwood, anything that could fill the ditch enough for a ladder to stand.

And behind them again, the deeper shadow of Tipu's guns.

The first Mysorean cannon spoke, and the ball struck the wall with a dull thud that travelled through the stone into my teeth.

Hendrik answered.

Travancore's guns fired from the platforms, the recoil making the wooden carriages jump. The muzzle flash lit the faces of the gunners for an instant, eyes wide, teeth bared, sweat shining.

Grapeshot tore into the ditch.

Men fell.

The ditch swallowed them and kept moving.

The first ladder hit the wall.

A Travancore soldier leaned over and hacked at the hands climbing it with a billhook. Fingers flew. A man screamed and dropped.

Another ladder went up.

Another.

It was like watching ants climb a tree, endless and patient, except these ants had rockets and muskets.

Caspar ran along the parapet, shouting orders that cut through the noise.

He was not supposed to be there. An engineer should stay near his guns, protect powder, think, not shout.

Caspar could never stay where he was supposed to be.

He leaned over the parapet and fired a pistol into the smoke, point blank, then turned and laughed at something Hendrik yelled at him.

Madness.

Bravery.

The line between them is thin as fuse cord.

---

The first assault broke against the wall.

After an hour of screaming rockets and ladders and men dying in the ditch, Tipu's infantry pulled back, dragging wounded, leaving dead.

On our side, men leaned on muskets and coughed smoke out of their lungs.

Someone vomited over the parapet.

Someone began to laugh, high and broken, and then slapped himself to stop.

I climbed down from the firing step and walked along the inner road, checking on my troopers.

One of them, a boy with a beard barely grown, stared at his hands as if surprised they were still attached.

"They will come again," I told him.

He nodded, jaw clenched.

I looked up at the wall.

The parapet stones were chipped.
The stakes were blackened.
The ditch below was a stew of smoke, blood, and broken ladders.

The wall had held.

Holding is not winning.

Holding only means you have bought time.

---

The second assault came before dawn, when the men on the wall were most tired and the powder boys were half asleep.

This time the rockets fell not only into the ditch.

They fell onto the gun platforms.

One struck a stack of brushwood and turned it into a torch. Another hit a powder cloth and sent men scrambling, screaming, beating at sparks with their bare hands.

Hendrik bellowed orders, voice hoarse.

"Cover the powder," he shouted. "Cover it. If it goes, we all go."

Caspar ran into the smoke with a bucket.

I saw him climb onto the platform, hair slick with rain, eyes bright as if this was the moment he had been waiting for all his life.

He threw water on the burning brushwood and the steam rose, hissing.

Then a rocket struck near his feet.

The blast threw him backward.

For a moment I saw him in the flash, limbs spread, mouth open, not screaming, simply shocked.

He hit the stone hard and did not move.

Hendrik roared his brother's name, a sound that tore something in my chest.

Men surged toward Caspar.

Another rocket fell.

More men shouted.

The ditch filled again.

And then, at a section slightly west of us, I heard a different sound.

Not a rocket scream.

Not a cannon thud.

A deep, rolling crack.

Earth giving way.

The wall shuddered under my feet.

Dust rose from the parapet stones.

Somewhere ahead, men screamed, not in pain, but in sudden terror.

"Breach," someone shouted.

The word travelled fast.

It moved faster than orders.

It moved faster than courage.

I ran along the inner road, boots slipping in mud, shouting for my troopers to follow.

When I reached the section, the sight made my stomach drop.

A portion of the rampart had collapsed inward, the outer face cracked, the ditch partly filled with fallen earth.

Tipu's men were already there, climbing over the new slope like water finding a gap.

Travancore soldiers fought them on the broken edge, muskets clubbed, swords swinging, men slipping in mud and blood.

This was no longer a wall.

This was a mouth.

And the mouth was opening.

I drew my knife.

Not because a knife is the right weapon for a breach.

Because it was the only thing I carried that felt honest.

"Dismount," I ordered. "Form a line. Hold them."

My troopers dismounted and formed behind the collapsing section, horses snorting, eyes rolling, sensing the chaos.

I took a spear from a dead man and planted my feet in the mud.

Tipu's first men came over the breach, shouting, faces streaked with soot, eyes wild.

I drove the spear into the first chest.

The man folded.

The second jumped over him.

Kesava was not there.

Hendrik was not there.

Caspar was somewhere behind, silent on stone.

It was only us, mud, and the surge of Mysore.

We held for minutes.

Minutes feel like hours when you are counting breaths.

Then, from the north, more rockets screamed, and more men came, and the breach widened as if the earth itself had decided to surrender.

An officer on the wall shouted a retreat order, voice breaking.

My troopers looked at me.

If I said hold, we would die.
If I said run, we might save some.

I thought of Mariam in our house, oil lamp burning, waiting for a sound that would tell her whether to live or to flee.

I thought of the refugees who had walked into Travancore because they believed walls meant safety.

I thought of the brand on my face.

The world does not forgive.

The world only counts what you do next.

"Fall back," I ordered, voice raw. "Slow. Together."

We stepped back, spears and knives and muskets forming a shrinking fence.

Tipu's men poured through the breach.

The Lines, the great scar we had carved into the land, had been opened.

Behind us, Hendrik's guns kept firing, slower now, desperate, covering a retreat that tasted like ash.


# Chapter 23: Fire and Flight

When a wall falls, the land behind it learns what it is to be naked.

The Lines had been more than earth and stone. They had been an idea. Travancore behind a barrier, safe enough to argue about taxes and temple rituals as if the north was a rumour.

After the breach, the north became a hand on our throat.

---

We retreated in pieces at first.

Not a clean withdrawal.

Not ranks stepping back to a drum.

Men ran.
Men carried wounded.
Men abandoned guns because wheels sink in Kerala mud and fear makes everything heavier.

Hendrik kept firing until the last moment, covering the withdrawal with the stubbornness of a man who has run out of ways to protect his brother.

When we finally pulled back from the wall, the gun platform behind us was a churned mess of broken wood, spilled powder, and blood.

Caspar's body was still there.

Two gunners were trying to lift him. His limbs were awkward, heavy, as if the moment the rocket hit he had become only meat.

Hendrik stood over them, face grey, eyes wide.

He did not cry.

He did not shout.

He simply looked as if someone had cracked his spine.

I stepped toward him and stopped with my hand half-raised, then let it drop.

Hendrik looked at me.

"He ran toward the fire," he said, voice flat.

It was accusation and pride in the same breath.

"He always did," I replied.

Hendrik's mouth twitched.

"Yes," he said. "And now the fire finally took him."

He bent down, took Caspar's hand, and closed the fingers around a small wooden cross Caspar wore on a cord.

"Carry him," Hendrik ordered the gunners. His voice sharpened on the word, becoming command because grief had no other shape he could hold.

They lifted Caspar and stumbled away.

I watched them go and felt something hard settle in me.

Caspar had been brave, reckless, brilliant under pressure.

He had also been young enough to believe bravery might be enough.

The wall had taught us otherwise.

---

Tipu's men poured through the breach like water through a split jar.

They moved fast, disciplined, not stopping to loot at first. The looting came later, when they could afford to be cruel.

In the first villages south of the Lines, they took cattle.
They took rice.
They took young men to drag guns.

Then, when resistance flared, they burned.

I saw the first burned temple at midday, smoke still rising from the roof beams.

The stone idols had been smashed, not because smashing them had tactical value, but because smashing them was a message.

In the next village, a small Syrian church had been opened like a box and emptied. The wooden cross above the door lay broken in the mud. A bell had been cut down and stolen, because even metal can be turned into humiliation.

Mariam's people had fled into Travancore believing walls could protect faith.

Now faith lay in ash beside the road.

Kesava met me at a crossroads with his troop, mud up to his calves and anger in his eyes.

"Where is the king?" he demanded.

"Retreating south," I replied. "Kesavadas is with him."

Kesava spat.

"Tipu is pushing hard," he said. "He wants to reach the sea. He wants to prove he can."

We rode together, two troops of cavalry moving like a net thrown backward, trying to slow a flood.

At one bridge, Tipu's forward scouts had already arrived.

They were not a full force. Maybe thirty riders, light cavalry, confident because confidence travels fast with a victorious army.

Kesava and I did not give them time to become a rumour.

We charged.

The bridge was narrow, slick with rain.

Hooves slipped.
Men shouted.
Steel rang.

I drove my horse straight into the centre and used the knife the way my father had taught me to use a sword. Not pretty. Not elegant. Effective.

One Mysorean rider tried to turn his horse sideways to block us. I leaned low and cut at his thigh. He screamed and fell, and his horse bolted, eyes rolling white.

Kesava took a man off his saddle with a clean talwar cut, the kind of cut that makes people believe in legends.

The Mysoreans broke and fled back into the trees.

We did not chase far.

Chasing is how cavalry dies when the enemy is smarter than your anger.

We held the bridge long enough for a line of ox carts and refugees to cross south.

Then we burned it.

The fire took quickly, wood soaked in oil.

The flames rose, licking at rain, defiant.

Watching it, I felt a sick understanding.

We were burning our own land to save it.

That is what war does. It makes you choose which parts of yourself to destroy.

---

That night we camped in a coconut grove, the trees standing like silent sentries.

The air was thick.
The insects were loud again.

The frogs croaked, indifferent to kings.

Kesava sat by a small fire, cleaning his blade.

I sat beside him, wiping my knife.

The blade was stained dark.

Not only with Mysorean blood.

With the past.

"Where is Mariam?" Kesava asked suddenly.

The question surprised me.

He had not wanted her in my life.

Now he spoke her name like it was a piece of strategy.

"At the house," I replied. "With Father Thomas and Thomman. They are moving refugees south."

Kesava grunted.

"Good," he said. "If she dies because you kept her near the Lines, I will drag you to Revathi myself and let her decide what to do with you."

It was an insult.

It was also, in Kesava's language, concern.

I stared into the fire and thought of Mariam's words.

Build a wall that holds.

The wall had not held.

So now we would have to become the wall.

Somewhere in the north, the breach widened, and Tipu's army moved through it with the certainty of a man who believed God had given him the coast.

South of us, the backwaters waited, wide and slow and deceptive, like peace.

Between Tipu and the sea stood only exhausted soldiers and people who had already lost everything once.

We rode at dawn.

# Chapter 24: The Tiger at Alleppey

I had always thought a king was something you could not touch.

In the Deccan, kings were distant. Names on coins. Men behind curtains. Even when you fought for them, you fought for their banner, not their flesh.

In Travancore, the king was closer, but still protected by ritual and distance. You prostrated. You spoke through ministers. You kept your eyes down.

Then Tipu's cavalry found Dharma Raja on the road near Alleppey, and the distance collapsed into blood and mud.

---

We had been retreating for days, falling back from village to village, turning bridges into fires, turning roads into choke points, trying to slow an army that moved like a tide.

The land changed as we moved south.

The jungle thinned.
The water widened.
The air became heavier, salted by the sea.

The backwaters began to appear beside the road, broad channels with still surfaces that reflected the sky like polished metal. Boats slid along them, quiet, carrying rice, coconuts, frightened families, whatever could be moved before Mysore hands reached it.

Kesavadas had advised the king to move closer to the water.

Not because he wanted to flee.

Because the water offered options.

If Tipu broke through completely, the king could be moved by boat, hidden among the channels like a fish among reeds.

Kings survive by keeping their bodies mobile.

That morning, Kesava and I were two miles behind the royal party, riding hard, managing the rearguard, dealing with stragglers and panic.

We heard the fighting before we saw it.

Not cannon.

Close fighting.

Horses screaming.
Men shouting in Malayalam.
Steel ringing.

Kesava's head snapped up.

"Forward," he barked, and we spurred.

The road narrowed between water and coconut grove. The mud was deep, churned by carts. Our horses struggled, hooves sinking and pulling free with wet sucking sounds.

We rounded a bend and saw the royal escort scattered.

Not in formation.

Scattered like startled birds.

Tipu's forward cavalry had caught them.

They were not a full Mysorean army.

They were a hunting party, perhaps a hundred riders, light and fast, men who had ridden ahead of the main force to find the king and end the war with one cut.

Their uniforms were dark, their turbans tight, their faces streaked with sweat. Some carried lances. Some carried sabers. One man held a rocket tube like a staff, ready to fire into the chaos.

Travancore guards fought desperately around a palanquin that had been abandoned in the mud.

The king was not in it.

He was on horseback, because there had been no time for dignity.

Dharma Raja's horse was a fine animal, but the king sat it like a scholar forced onto a battlefield. His posture was rigid. His hands were too tight on the reins.

An officer rode beside him, shouting, trying to turn the horse toward the water.

A Mysorean rider cut in and slashed.

The officer fell.

Dharma Raja's horse reared, eyes rolling.

The king did not fall.

That, in that moment, earned my respect more than any prayer.

"To the king," Kesava shouted.

We drove our horses into the melee.

There was no room for a beautiful charge.

There was only the brutal work of forcing bodies apart.

I cut at a lance shaft, hacked at a man's wrist, felt steel bite into steel with a shock that ran up my arm.

Kesava's talwar flashed.

He rode like a man who had forgotten fear, his blade moving in clean arcs, cutting space open.

A Mysorean rider lunged at me, saber raised.

I leaned low, ducked the swing, and drove my knife up under his ribs.

His breath left him in a wet gasp.

He slid off his saddle and vanished into mud.

I did not look down.

Looking down is how you die.

We reached the king.

Dharma Raja's eyes were wide, but his face was strangely calm, as if his mind had stepped away from panic and into a cold place where observation lives.

He saw my forehead.

I saw him register the letters without time to react.

Then another Mysorean rider came in fast, aiming not at me, not at Kesava, but at the king's exposed side.

I threw my horse between them.

The saber hit my shoulder.

Pain exploded, bright and immediate.

For a heartbeat, the world narrowed to that one line of fire across flesh.

Then training took over.

I grabbed the rider's wrist, yanked him close, and drove my knife into his throat.

Blood sprayed warm.

His eyes widened in surprise, as if he had expected the king to be easier prey than a branded cavalryman.

He toppled backward and fell.

My shoulder burned.

I tasted iron in my mouth.

I did not let my face show it.

The king stared at me.

"You are hurt," he said, voice thin.

"Not yet," I lied.

Kesava barked orders to the remaining guards.

"Circle," he shouted. "Close. Close."

We formed a ring around Dharma Raja, horses pressed flank to flank, spears angled outward, blades ready.

Mysorean cavalry hit the ring and bounced off.

Horses screamed when they collided.

Men cursed.

One rider tried to push through anyway and was dragged down and trampled.

The road was too narrow for Tipu's men to use their numbers properly.

That was our only advantage.

Behind us, the water lay open.

Boats waited at a small landing, fishermen and palace servants mixed together in frantic labour.

"To the boats," Kesava ordered.

We began to move, the ring shifting as a unit, step by brutal step, like men carrying a heavy load through a crowd.

The Mysoreans followed, snapping at the edges.

One fired a rocket.

The screaming iron streaked past my head and slammed into a coconut trunk, exploding into sparks and smoke.

The smell of burnt fibre filled the air.

The horses shied.

The ring wavered.

"Hold," I shouted, voice raw, and forced my horse forward, shoulder screaming.

We reached the landing.

Servants grabbed at the king, trying to pull him off his horse.

Dharma Raja resisted, pride flaring even now.

"I can walk," he snapped.

Kesava seized his arm.

"Then walk," he replied. "But walk into a boat, Your Highness."

The king stumbled, face tightening with pain.

Only then did I see the blood on his side, a thin line that darkened his cloth.

He had been cut too.

Even kings bleed.

We shoved him into the boat.

The boat rocked, water slapping the sides.

Mysorean cavalry reached the landing and tried to follow.

We met them at the edge, blades flashing.

A man grabbed my wounded shoulder and pain flared so hard I nearly blacked out.

I drove my elbow into his face and heard cartilage crack.

He fell into the water with a splash and disappeared among reeds.

Kesava kicked another rider's horse in the flank, sending it sideways into the channel.

Horse and man went in together, thrashing.

The canal was not deep enough to drown quickly.

It was deep enough to trap.

The boat pushed off.

Men on the bank shoved with poles.

The king sat hunched, hand pressed to his side, jaw clenched.

He looked at me.

"Who are you?" he asked, voice quiet.

It was the first time he had spoken to me directly like a man, not through ceremony.

I stood in the shallow water, knife in hand, blood dripping from my sleeve, and my brand exposed to the world.

"Bhalerao," I said.

The king's eyes flicked to my forehead again.

Then, to my surprise, he nodded.

"Bhalerao," he repeated, as if fixing the name into memory. "You saved my life."

I wanted to say I was only paying debts.

My father's debt.
Travancore's debt.
My own debt to the dead priest whose blood I could not wash away.

Instead I said, "It is my duty."

Dharma Raja's mouth tightened.

"Duty," he murmured. "Yes. That is what keeps kingdoms from becoming stories."

The boat slid into the channel, reeds closing around it, hiding it from the road.

On the bank, Tipu's men shouted in fury, firing muskets uselessly into water and green.

Their rage sounded like frustration more than triumph.

They had come for the king and had found only blood and escape.

As the boat carried Dharma Raja away through the backwaters, I stood on the muddy bank with my men and watched the channel swallow him.

My shoulder throbbed.
My hand shook slightly.

Kesava touched my arm once, quick.

"You did well," he said.

It was the closest thing to tenderness he would ever offer.

I looked north, toward smoke, toward the broken Lines, toward an army that believed it could take the sea.

Then I looked at the water, at the king vanishing into reeds like a rumour.

For the first time since the temple stones, I felt a strange, bitter pride.

Not pride in killing.

Pride in standing in the way so someone else could live.


# Chapter 25: The Flag

Tipu did not retreat from Travancore because he ran out of courage.

He retreated because another army moved against him from the east, and even tigers must turn when the jungle catches fire.

When the British arrived, they did not come with poetry about saving kingdoms. They came with account books, cannon, and the calm certainty of men who believed the peninsula was a board game and we were pieces that could be rearranged.

They brought relief.

They also brought the taste of the future.

---

The first British soldiers I saw in this war marched into our ruined north like men walking into property they already owned.

Red coats stained dark by rain.
White faces flushed and sweating in the heat.
Sepoys in Company colours moving with practised discipline, eyes scanning the jungle as if it might owe them money.

Their cannon were hauled by oxen that struggled in mud, but the British officers did not struggle. They rode horses bred for better roads and acted as if the land should apologise for being wet.

Colonel Stuart met Kesavadas at a temporary camp near the rebuilt portion of the Lines.

He was not young. His hair was already thinning, his face lined, his uniform worn clean by use. He looked at the breach and did not pretend surprise.

"Tipu hits hard," he said in careful Portuguese, then switched to a simpler Malayalam learned from interpreters. "But he cannot be everywhere."

He looked at Kesavadas, then at me.

His gaze paused on my forehead, then moved on without comment.

That small act of discipline made me respect him more than any speech.

Captain Blackwood stood behind him, younger, sharper, eyes bright with ambition.

He watched our ruined villages with interest, not grief.

"Plenty of work for suppliers," he said in English, not bothering to lower his voice, assuming we could not understand. "And plenty of opportunity for men who know how to price desperation."

Pieter's ghost of a lesson rose in my mind, the way Europeans can smile while counting your bones.

I did not speak English, but I understood tone.

Greed has a universal language.

Kesavadas spoke politely, because politeness is what keeps allies from becoming masters too quickly.

I stood behind him and watched the British guns roll north.

If Tipu was a tide, the British were a weight.

They would push him back.

They would also sink into our soil.

---

Tipu pulled his main force out of Travancore in the early rains.

He did it fast, because he could not afford to be caught between British cannon and Travancore anger.

His rearguards burned what they could not carry.

Granaries.
Boats.
Temples that had already been looted.
Churches that had already been emptied.

They wanted the land behind them to be a wound.

We pursued anyway.

Not because pursuit would heal anything.

Because pursuit is how you tell a retreating enemy that he does not leave as a god. He leaves as a man who can bleed.

Kesava and I rode north with a mixed force, Travancore cavalry, some Company sepoys, a few British dragoons who looked uncomfortable in this green wet land.

The British moved with caution, always thinking of supply lines.

Kesava moved with anger, always thinking of insult.

I moved with something colder.

I had been hunted once.

Now I hunted.

We caught Tipu's rearguard near a stretch of the Lines that had not fully fallen, a section of rampart still standing like a broken tooth.

The Mysoreans were trying to haul a small field gun through mud, their oxen exhausted, their men snapping at each other.

They saw us and tried to form.

Too late.

Kesava raised his talwar.

"Now," he shouted.

We hit them in a rush of hooves and shouting.

The mud splashed up to my knees. My horse slipped and recovered. A Mysorean infantryman thrust a spear up at my mount's chest and I cut his arm with the knife, not cleanly, not gracefully, just enough to make him drop the shaft and scream.

In the chaos, my eyes caught on something that did not belong in mud.

Green silk, bright against brown.

A standard.

The standard bearer was young, face tight with fear and pride, gripping the pole as if holding it upright could hold the world upright.

The cloth snapped in wind, and on it, stitched in gold and black, was the tiger.

Snarling.
Striding.
A beast that Tipu had made into an empire's symbol.

My stomach tightened.

This flag had flown over burned churches and smashed temples.
It had flown over forced marches.
It had flown over the breach that killed Caspar.

The standard bearer saw me and tried to turn his horse, keeping the flag away from my hands.

I spurred.

The distance closed fast, hooves pounding, breath harsh in my throat.

He raised his sword.

I did not give him time to use it.

I drove my knife into his shoulder, felt it bite through cloth and flesh, then yanked it free and grabbed the pole with my left hand.

The boy screamed and fell sideways, still clutching the wood.

For a heartbeat we wrestled, his dying strength clinging to symbol.

Then Kesava's horse slammed into his mount and the standard bearer went down into the mud, the flag folding over him like a shroud.

I tore the pole free.

The cloth whipped around my face, wet, heavy, smelling of smoke and sweat and something sharp like old blood.

I held it upright without thinking, because a soldier understands flags the way a priest understands icons.

Men saw it and shouted.

Travancore soldiers shouted in triumph.
Sepoys shouted because shouting is how you convince yourself you are winning.

The Mysoreans saw the tiger go into our hands and something broke in them.

They fled.

We chased only far enough to make the retreat a wound, then pulled back, because discipline is the difference between victory and ambush.

---

When we rode back toward the Lines with the captured flag, rain began again, fine and steady.

Kesava rode beside me, breathing hard, blood on his sleeve.

He glanced at the green silk.

"That will make stories," he said.

I looked at the tiger stitched in thread, mouth open forever in a snarl that could not bite.

"Yes," I replied.

Kesava grinned, fierce.

"Let Tipu hear of it," he said. "Let him know his god can be grabbed by a man from the Deccan with a brand on his face."

The words should have satisfied me.

Instead I felt only a strange hollowness.

The flag was heavy in my hand.

Not because of the cloth.

Because of what it had witnessed.

We raised it on a section of the reclaimed rampart as a signal.

Travancore still stood.

Tipu could retreat, but he could not pretend he had been victorious here.

As the green silk snapped above the wall, I thought of the refugees who had walked south believing walls meant safety.

Walls do not mean safety.

Walls only mean you have chosen where you will bleed.

# Chapter 26: The Treaty

Men talk about treaties as if they are peace.

They are not peace.

They are pauses, written down, sealed with wax and blood, and enforced by whoever has the bigger guns.

In 1792, when Tipu signed at Seringapatam, Travancore breathed again.

But the breath tasted of ink.

---

I saw Seringapatam first as a rumour made solid.

We had marched for weeks with allied forces, moving north and east through country that grew drier, flatter, less forgiving. Kerala's green fell away behind us. Rivers narrowed. The air lost its salt. Dust returned, fine and persistent, finding its way into cloth and mouth.

The British marched with confidence, their logistics a kind of arrogance. Bullock carts in lines. Powder under guard. Engineers measuring everything, including the patience of the land.

Indian allies marched with different reasons.

Some for pay.
Some for revenge.
Some because refusing the Company is another way of dying.

When we finally reached the Kaveri and saw the island fort, it looked like a beast crouched in water.

Walls rising from river.
Guns pointing from stone.
Flags snapping over battlements.

Tipu had built this place to be an answer to Europe.

Now Europe had come to his door with India at its side.

The siege itself was not my battle to tell. Others will write of the batteries, the trenches, the guns dragged through mud. Others will describe how the walls shuddered when British cannon found their rhythm.

I remember different things.

The smell of powder that never left the air.
The way men spoke in whispers as if the fort could hear them.
The way the river kept flowing, indifferent.

And I remember the day the treaty was made, because treaties are where the truth of war shows itself.

---

We were not allowed into the negotiations.

Indian allies rarely are.

We stood in the outer camp while men in clean coats argued over maps.

I watched Colonel Stuart walk past with a folder under his arm, face calm, eyes tired.

Captain Blackwood followed him, smiling as if this was a festival.

Blackwood's smile was never empty. It was always counting.

"They will bleed him," he said to another officer in English, voice bright. "Territory. Money. Hostages. The tiger will be declawed properly this time."

He noticed me looking and gave me a friendly nod, as if friendliness erased contempt.

I looked away.

There are kinds of hatred that exhaust you more than battle.

Kesava stood beside me, arms folded, jaw tight.

"They speak as if they own the victory," he muttered.

"They own the paper," I replied. "Paper becomes ownership."

Kesava snorted.

"You sound like Kesavadas," he said.

I did not deny it.

War had been teaching me lessons I had avoided when I was young and stupid and hungry for opium.

Violence makes you strong for a moment.

But paper makes you strong for generations.

---

When the treaty was finally signed, we did not hear the words first.

We heard the guns.

A salute, twelve shots, timed and deliberate.

The camp exhaled.

Men cheered.
Men fell to their knees.
Men laughed and cried as if those were the only two human sounds left.

Then the hostages came.

Tipu's sons, two boys in fine cloth, walked out under guard.

They were not infants.

They were old enough to understand that they were being traded.

They were old enough to understand that their father's empire was being cut into pieces on a table they could not see.

One boy held his head high, jaw clenched, eyes fierce with inherited pride.

The other looked down, lashes wet, trying to be brave and failing.

They walked between British officers like lambs between butchers.

I felt something twist in me.

I hated Tipu for what his men had done to Malabar. I hated him for the ditch full of smoke. I hated him for Caspar's body on stone.

And yet, looking at those boys, I could not pretend victory was clean.

A soldier can kill men and live with it.

Seeing children turned into currency is a different poison.

Kesava's mouth tightened.

"He would have done the same," he whispered, as if reading my thoughts. "Tipu would have taken our princes if he could."

"Yes," I replied.

That did not make it feel less filthy.

Father Thomas's words came back to me, unexpected.

God does not ask which army you rode with.
He asks what you did when you dismounted.

Watching those boys, I wondered what any of us had become when we dismounted from this war.

---

That night, the British camp celebrated.

Not like Travancore celebrates, with rituals and restraint.

The British celebrated with meat, rum, and the hard laughter of men who believe they are civilised because they drink from glass instead of clay.

Sepoys watched, faces unreadable.

Indian allies took what pay they could and tried to keep their anger quiet.

Captain Blackwood walked through the camp with an account book in his hand and a grin on his face.

He spoke to a supplier, then to a quartermaster, then to a clerk.

Money moved with him like a shadow.

Colonel Stuart sat alone near a lantern, writing.

When I passed, he looked up briefly.

"You fought well in Travancore," he said in Portuguese, tone genuine.

I nodded, wary.

He gestured toward the distant fort, its outline black against the night.

"This is not over," he said quietly. "It never is."

Then he went back to his writing, as if the only defence against empire was to put words into order.

I returned to my tent and lay down with my knife beside me, like always.

Outside, men drank and sang.

Inside, I stared at the canvas and thought of Mariam and our small house by the backwaters.

Travancore had survived.

But now the British had tasted the peninsula more deeply, and men who taste power do not stop at one mouthful.

# Chapter 27: New Masters

After the treaty, Travancore tried to pretend the world could go back to what it had been.

The priests returned to arguing about ritual.
The merchants returned to haggling over pepper.
The farmers returned to coaxing rice from flooded fields.

But the war had changed the air.

It was quieter now, yes.

It was also watched.

The British did not leave when the fighting stopped. They only changed the shape of their presence, from cannon to contracts.

---

Captain Blackwood came to Travancore three months after Seringapatam.

He arrived with letters and a smile and boots too clean for our roads. Behind him came clerks, sepoys, and a train of porters carrying boxes that looked like gifts until you remembered that gifts from powerful men always have strings.

Kesavadas received him at court with the same controlled politeness he used on kings.

I stood behind Kesavadas with Kesava and watched the British officer bow, straighten, and look around the hall as if assessing what could be moved.

Blackwood's eyes lingered on the temple lamps, on the carved pillars, on the guards' spears.

Then his gaze found my forehead and paused.

For an instant the polite mask slipped and I saw what he saw.

A criminal in uniform.
A weapon with an ugly history.

Then the mask returned.

"Captain Blackwood," he said in Portuguese, smooth. "You have travelled far."

He spoke as if he were doing us a favour by arriving.

"Travancore is worth the travel," Kesavadas replied, equally smooth. "It pays its debts."

The word debts hung in the air like incense.

Blackwood smiled wider.

"That is exactly why we are friends," he said.

Friends.

He used the word the way a butcher uses fat, generously, without understanding that the animal hears.

---

The demands came with the smile.

More supplies for Company troops.
Better roads for Company carts.
Guarantees about pepper exports.

And, behind all of it, the unspoken assumption that a kingdom that had been saved by British guns now belonged to British influence.

Kesavadas argued in the language of treaties.

Blackwood argued in the language of inevitability.

At one point, Blackwood gestured toward the north as if Tipu were still there.

"We kept the tiger off your throat," he said. "Surely you understand the value of continued protection."

Kesavadas replied calmly, "Protection is not free."

Blackwood laughed.

"Nothing is free," he said, as if revealing a profound truth.

Kesava leaned toward me and muttered, "He thinks we are children who have just discovered hunger."

I watched Blackwood's hands.

They were clean.
Soft.
The hands of a man who kills by signing.

In the Deccan, I had feared men with swords.

Now I began to fear men with paper.

---

At home, Mariam listened to my report of the meeting while she ground spices with a stone that made a steady, patient sound.

The house smelled of curry leaves and smoke from the kitchen fire.

A child cried from the inner room.

Our son, not yet five, angry because the world refused to obey him.

Mariam did not go to him immediately. She kept grinding, letting the child cry itself tired.

"You are tense," she said without looking up.

I flexed my wounded shoulder. The saber cut from Alleppey still ached when rain came.

"Blackwood was here," I replied.

Mariam's grinding slowed.

"The one with the smile," she said.

"Yes."

She resumed grinding, harder now, as if punishing the stone.

"He wants more than pepper," she said.

It was not a question.

"He wants everything," I replied.

Mariam set the stone down and wiped her hands on her cloth.

She looked at my forehead.

Then at my eyes.

"You used to think the brand was the worst thing that could be written on a man," she said quietly.

I did not answer.

"Now you see," she continued, "there are marks you cannot burn out of skin because they are burned into law."

Our son cried louder.

Mariam rose and went to him.

I heard her voice from the inner room, low, steady, soothing.

The crying softened, then stopped.

I sat at the doorway and watched rain begin again, thin and persistent.

The world outside our walls felt close.

Not because of Mysore.

Because of the Company.

---

Colonel Stuart visited later, without a train, without theatre.

He came with only one clerk and two sepoys, and he asked to speak privately.

Kesavadas met him in a smaller room, away from the court's listening ears.

I was present because Stuart preferred soldiers to priests.

I respected him for that.

Stuart looked tired.

"My government does not trust Tipu," he said, direct. "And Tipu does not accept humiliation quietly."

Kesavadas nodded. "We know."

Stuart continued, "There will be another war."

The words landed like a stone.

Kesava's jaw tightened.

"And when it comes," Stuart added, "you will need to decide where you stand."

Kesavadas did not blink.

"We stood when Tipu came," he replied. "We will stand again."

Stuart's gaze shifted, and for a moment I saw something almost like respect.

"Then prepare," he said. "And keep Captain Blackwood away from your stores. He will steal you blind while smiling."

Kesava snorted.

Stuart stood to leave.

At the door he paused and looked at me.

"You," he said, "were at the breach at Travancore."

"Yes," I replied.

"And at the skirmish near Alleppey," he added.

"Yes."

He looked at the brand on my forehead again, and I expected judgement.

Instead he said, quietly, "Men with ugly histories are often the ones who do not romanticise war."

Then he left.

When he was gone, Kesavadas exhaled slowly.

"The British are not one thing," he said. "Some are soldiers. Some are merchants. Some are thieves. But all of them believe the future belongs to them."

Kesava spat.

"The future belongs to whoever holds a blade," he said.

Kesavadas looked at him.

"No," he replied. "The future belongs to whoever holds the paper that says your blade is illegal."

Silence followed.

In that silence I understood that Tipu was not our only tiger.

He was simply the tiger we could see.


# Chapter 28: The Fourth War

Tipu did not learn caution from defeat.

He learned anger.

By 1799, the anger had become a kind of hunger in the British. They spoke of Tipu the way priests speak of demons, as if killing him would cleanse the world.

It was never about cleansing.

It was about finishing.

---

The news arrived in Travancore with the first dry winds of the year.

Tipu had sent letters to the French.
Tipu had raised new troops.
Tipu had fortified his island fortress and filled it with guns.

The Company decided the tiger had to die before the French could feed him again.

General Harris would march.

Travancore was asked to contribute forces.

Asked is a polite word.

The request came with an expectation and an implied threat. Kingdoms that do not help the Company are treated like enemies. Sometimes politely, sometimes not.

Kesavadas called the council.

Priests argued about omens.
Nobles argued about money.
Captains argued about honour.

I sat at the edge of the room and watched men who had never heard a rocket scream decide whether they could afford another war.

When Kesavadas asked me, in private, whether I would go, I did not pretend to hesitate.

"Yes," I said.

Kesavadas studied me.

"Why?" he asked.

The burned church in Mariam's stories came back to me. Caspar's body. The king bleeding into a boat at Alleppey.

"Because I want to see it end," I replied.

Kesavadas nodded.

"Then go," he said. "And remember this. We are not marching as conquerors. We are marching as men paying for our own survival."

I went home and told Mariam.

She did not cry.

She had cried too much on the road north and learned that tears do not stop wars.

She looked at me for a long time, then said quietly, "Bring yourself back."

I nodded.

She reached up and touched my brand with two fingers, gentle, as if touching a scar could steady fate.

"If you die," she said, voice flat, "they will make stories about you. They will make you clean in the stories. I will not allow that."

I almost laughed.

Instead I leaned my forehead into her palm for a heartbeat, like a man seeking blessing from the only priest he trusted.

---

We marched north with a small Travancore contingent.

Cavalry for scouting.
Infantry for duty.
A few gunners trained by Hendrik, because Travancore's pride was always its guns.

Kesava rode with me.

He told his family he was going to serve the king.

He did not tell them he was going to chase a tiger into its den.

Major Doyle met us at the Company camp outside Coimbatore.

He was Irish, which meant the English treated him like a cousin they tolerated and distrusted.

He spoke Portuguese and Malayalam badly but with effort, which made him less unbearable than most.

When he learned Mariam was Syrian Catholic, his eyes softened slightly.

"My mother's people kept the faith under Protestant landlords," he told me quietly. "Different land, same lesson."

He said it without romance.

Doyle was a man who had learned that empires crush not only enemies.

He served the Company anyway, because serving is what soldiers do when there are no clean choices.

Captain Blackwood was there too, now more polished, more confident, wearing rank like a second skin.

He greeted me with a smile that suggested we were old friends.

"Balan Pillai," he said, pronouncing the name wrong. "Good to see Travancore still sends its best."

I did not answer.

Blackwood did not mind silence. He filled it with his own voice.

"This time," he said, "we will not leave the tiger with claws."

He walked away before I could respond, leaving the scent of cologne behind like an insult.

---

The march to Seringapatam was long, dry, and full of men.

British infantry in red.
Sepoys in Company colours.
Artillery trains stretching like a moving town.
Bullocks lowing, carts creaking, dust rising.

Indian allies rode and walked alongside.

I saw Hyderabad men with curved swords and quiet eyes.
I saw Company irregulars who looked like bandits with uniforms.
I saw Maratha horsemen who moved with the familiar arrogance of riders who believe the world belongs to speed.

It was among them that I saw the Deshmukh.

Not at first as a face.

As a posture.

Some men carry authority the way others carry weapons.

He rode at the head of a small Maratha contingent, hair grey now, moustache thick, jaw set. His men looked older too, men who had survived by becoming hard.

The Deshmukh's eyes moved across the camp, assessing, and then, like a knife finding flesh, they found me.

For a moment the noise of the army fell away.

I saw Sangamner again.
Temple stones wet with blood.
My father's hand pushing me into the dark.

The Deshmukh stared at my forehead.

He did not need to read the letters.

He had been reading them in his mind for forty years.

His horse shifted.

His men noticed his stillness and looked where he looked.

One of them whispered.

I could not hear the words, but I knew the shape of them.

Priest-killer.
Son-killer.
The man who escaped.

Kesava leaned close.

"Do not start this now," he muttered. "Not here."

I kept my gaze on the Deshmukh.

He did not ride toward me.

Not yet.

He turned his horse and moved on, as if saving the confrontation for a place that would hurt more.

I felt my stomach twist.

Some hunts do not end when the hunted becomes a soldier.

They end when the hunter grows tired.

Or when both men stand in the same ruin and admit what cannot be changed.

When we finally reached the Kaveri, Seringapatam rose from the water like a promise made of stone.

The island fortress sat tight within the river, walls thick, bastions strong, guns visible in embrasures. The river curled around it like a moat of living movement.

Tipu's flags flew over the battlements.

I saw the tiger symbol again and felt my hand tighten as if remembering the green silk I had taken in Travancore.

This was the source.

This was where the beast had made itself a king.

British engineers began their work immediately.

Trenches.
Batteries.
Guns placed with mathematical patience.

The siege settled into rhythm.

Gun fire.
Shovels.
Sweat.
Night watch.

Tipu answered with cannon and sorties.

Rockets screamed across the river at night, arcing like angry comets, bursting into sparks among the tents.

Men cursed.
Horses screamed.
A tent caught fire and was stamped out with boots.

Major Doyle walked the lines with me one evening, watching the fort.

"He will die," Doyle said quietly.

It was not a boast.

It was a soldier's assessment.

"Yes," I replied.

Doyle glanced at me.

"And what will you be when he is dead?" he asked.

The question made my throat tighten.

I looked back at the fort, the stone beast in the river.

"Still marked," I said.

Doyle nodded, understanding more than most.

"Then keep walking," he said. "Men like us cannot afford to stop."

# Chapter 29: The Breach

The last days of the siege were a kind of waiting that eats men alive.

You wake to gun fire.
You eat while cannon balls pass overhead.
You sleep in fragments, listening for the scream of a rocket that might decide your tent is next.

Everything becomes routine.

That is how war tricks you.

It turns horror into habit.

---

The breach was opened by mathematics.

British gunners did not fire with the rage of men seeking revenge. They fired with method. Battery guns, shot after shot, same angle, same target, same patient violence.

Stone shuddered.
Dust rose.
Chunks fell.

Each day the wall looked a little less like an answer and a little more like a question.

Tipu's gunners answered from the bastions, and the river between us became a place where iron and water argued without end.

On the morning of May 4, 1799, the air felt wrong.

Too still.

Even the birds seemed to have left the trees along the riverbank.

Major Doyle came to our contingent before noon.

"Assault today," he said, voice clipped. "Be ready."

Kesava swore softly under his breath.

I checked my knife, then checked the talwar I had been given by Ananthan years before, a blade forged in the Deccan but used now in Travancore service. The steel was clean, oiled, sharp.

Clean steel is a lie. It is only waiting.

At midday, the order came.

British officers moved along the line, shouting.
Drummers began.
Men tightened straps and checked flints.

The storming party formed up by the river.

General Baird led the main column, his face hard, his eyes fixed on the breach as if the wall had personally insulted him.

I saw Colonel Wellesley briefly, a younger man on horseback, narrow-faced, watching everything with a gaze that looked older than his years. He did not shout. He did not smile. He simply observed, as if already writing the future in his head.

Then the world narrowed to the breach.

---

We went in across the river, wading where the water was shallow enough and scrambling over rocks where it was not.

Boots filled with water.
Cloth clung to skin.
Men cursed as powder horns threatened to get wet.

The first shot from the fort cracked over our heads.

Then another.

Then rockets.

The scream of them hit the spine like cold fingers.

One burst among the sepoys beside us, spraying sparks and iron splinters. A man fell, hands at his face, blood running through his fingers. Another man tripped over him and went down into the water, flailing.

The column kept moving.

That was the assault's cruelty.

You do not stop for the wounded. You step over them and hope someone behind you can drag them out.

The breach loomed, a jagged gap in the wall where stone had been chewed away.

Smoke poured from it.

Not only gun smoke.

Dust smoke.

The breath of crushed fortification.

We hit the breach in a rush.

Men climbed.
Men slipped.
Men shoved each other, not out of malice, but because a narrow gap does not care about politeness.

I grabbed a stone edge with my left hand, hauled myself up, and felt the roughness tear at my palm.

At the top, a Mysorean soldier lunged at me with a bayonet fixed to his musket.

I knocked the musket aside with my forearm and drove my knife into his throat.

His eyes widened.

He tried to speak.

Only blood came.

He fell backward into the smoke and vanished.

I did not follow with my eyes.

Following the dead is how you join them.

Kesava was beside me, talwar moving, cutting through the tight space like a man carving his name into stone.

British soldiers pushed in behind, bayonets out, faces red with effort.

Sepoys surged too, their discipline holding under fire, their eyes fierce.

Inside the fort, the air was thicker.

Smoke hung low.
The heat was sudden, trapped between walls.
The noise became close, no longer distant cannon thunder but human shouting, flesh-level.

Tipu's men fought hard.

They did not run.

They knew what surrender meant in this war.

The fighting turned into pockets.

A corner.
A courtyard.
A gate.

Each one a small battle.

I lost sense of time.

A minute could be a lifetime.

At one point, a Mysorean soldier grabbed my uniform and tried to pull me down. His face was smeared with soot, his eyes wild.

He shouted something in Kannada I did not understand.

His breath smelled of betel and fear.

I headbutted him.

The impact rang in my skull.

He staggered.

Kesava cut him down without looking, as if the blade had eyes of its own.

We pushed deeper.

Rockets fired from within the fort now, short range, brutal. One slammed into a wall and burst, filling a narrow lane with smoke and sparks. Men screamed and fell, clothes burning. A British officer shouted for water, as if water could solve an explosion.

In the chaos, I saw something that made my stomach turn.

A British soldier, face twisted with rage, bayoneted a wounded Mysorean who was trying to crawl away.

The Mysorean made a sound that was more animal than human.

The British soldier yanked the bayonet free and laughed.

Not victory laughter.

The laughter of a man discovering what he is capable of.

I wanted to hit him.

There was no time.

War gives you a list of things you want to do and then burns the list.

---

By late afternoon, the fort's resistance began to break in places.

We reached a larger courtyard near the inner gates, bodies scattered, smoke curling along the ground.

An officer shouted, "Tipu is dead."

The words travelled fast, faster than musket balls.

Men cheered.
Men roared.
Men surged forward with new violence, as if the tiger's death had loosened something in the human throat.

I did not cheer.

I did not trust it.

Then I saw the body.

Not at first as Tipu.

As a man in a fine coat, blood-dark, being carried by sepoys through the smoke.

His face was partly visible, moustache stiff, eyes half open, as if still refusing to accept the end.

Men crowded around, shouting in different languages.

Some spat.
Some tried to touch the body as if proof required fingers.

A British officer shouted orders to clear space.

General Baird rode past, face set.

Someone held up a sword, claiming it as Tipu's.

Someone else held up a piece of cloth, claiming it as his flag.

Greed began immediately.

Victory is a market.

As the sun lowered, the sack began.

Not officially, not announced.

It began as men stepping into houses, grabbing what they saw.
It became men dragging women by the arm.
It became men killing servants who tried to protect their master's property.

British and sepoy alike.

Empire makes everyone hungry.

I walked through a lane where a Mysorean child stood crying beside a dead woman.

The child's face was streaked with soot and tears.

He looked at my brand and did not know what it meant.

He only knew I was another soldier.

I kept walking.

That is the truth that shames me most.

Not what I did with a knife as a young addict.

What I failed to do with a sword as a seasoned man.

I found Kesava near a gate, his face smeared with blood, his eyes bright and empty.

"It is done," he said, voice hoarse.

"Yes," I replied.

We stood together and watched the fort burn from within, smoke rising into a sky that did not care.

Tipu was dead.

And the men who killed him were already becoming something else.

# Chapter 30: The Frenchman

The day after Seringapatam fell, the British tried to pretend the sack was discipline.

They posted sentries at gates.
They issued orders.
They hanged a few men caught with too much stolen cloth, as if cloth was the worst crime committed inside the fort.

But the damage had already been done.

A city does not become clean again because an officer decides it should.

Blood seeps into stone.

---

We found Colonel Doré in a small courtyard near a ruined storehouse.

He was not hiding.

He was standing with his hands tied, guarded by sepoys, his uniform torn and stained. His face was bruised, but his posture was straight.

A Frenchman looks different from an Englishman even when you strip him of dignity. His features were sharper. His moustache thinner. His eyes carried a kind of pride that did not need victory to exist.

Major Doyle led me there, because Doyle understood that a Catholic Frenchman and a branded Hindu cavalryman might recognise the same hypocrisy.

Doré looked up when we approached.

His gaze flicked to my forehead, then away, polite, as if refusing to stare was a form of civilisation.

An English officer stood beside Doré, reading from a paper as if paper could justify murder.

Captain Blackwood was there too, hands behind his back, smile faint.

Blackwood's eyes were bright.

He was enjoying this.

The English officer spoke in Portuguese for the benefit of the allies.

"Jean-Baptiste Doré," he announced. "Officer in the service of Tipu Sultan. Agent of the French Republic. Found within the fort. Taken with correspondence."

He held up a packet of papers, damp and stained.

"You are to be executed," the officer said.

There was no trial.

No debate.

Only sentence.

Doré listened without moving.

When the Portuguese translation finished, he spoke in accented Portuguese, voice steady.

"I served my master," he said. "As you serve yours."

The English officer's face tightened.

Captain Blackwood smiled wider.

"Your master is dead," Blackwood said in English, then repeated in Portuguese with a mocking softness. "And your nation is our enemy. You will die as an example."

Doré's eyes flicked to Blackwood.

"Examples are for children," he replied.

Blackwood's smile did not change, but his eyes hardened.

He wanted Doré to beg.

Doré would not.

---

They marched him to a wall near the river, where a firing party waited.

The morning was bright, cruelly clear, as if the sky wanted to witness.

The river flowed past, indifferent.

Doré walked without stumbling.

He did not plead.

He did not shout.

At the wall, an officer offered him a blindfold.

Doré refused with a small shake of his head.

"I will look," he said.

The officer shrugged.

British soldiers raised muskets.

They stood in a line, faces set, fingers on triggers, the routine of killing made respectable by uniform.

Major Doyle stood beside me, jaw clenched.

He whispered, "This is wrong."

I glanced at him.

"You serve them," I said quietly.

Doyle's mouth tightened.

"Yes," he replied. "And I hate myself for what that requires."

Doré looked at the firing party and said something in French, too quick for me to catch.

Then he spoke Portuguese again, voice low.

"Tell your Company," he said, looking past the rifles to Blackwood, "that killing men like me does not kill France. It only teaches the world what England is."

Blackwood's smile twitched.

He stepped forward.

"Fire," he ordered.

The officer hesitated, a fraction.

Then he repeated the command.

The muskets cracked together.

Smoke burst.

Doré's body jerked, once, hard.

He did not fall immediately.

His knees buckled slowly, as if his pride tried to keep him standing even as his blood left him.

Then he collapsed onto the stone.

A British soldier stepped forward and fired a pistol into Doré's head at close range, to be certain.

The sound was small compared to cannon.

It was intimate.

I felt my stomach turn.

This was not battle.

This was execution, clean and filthy at the same time.

Blackwood exhaled, satisfied.

"There," he said lightly. "Civilisation."

Major Doyle's hands clenched.

I watched Doré's blood seep into the stone.

A Frenchman had died for serving Tipu.

My father had died for saving me.

Men die for masters.

The masters rarely die for them.

---

Later that day, I found a British soldier looting a small room, stuffing silver into his coat.

He looked at me, startled, then glanced at my forehead and sneered.

"You lot are savage," he said in English, as if the word tasted good.

I did not understand the sentence fully.

I understood the contempt.

I stepped closer, slow.

The soldier stiffened, hand going to his bayonet.

Major Doyle appeared behind me and spoke sharply in English.

The soldier hesitated, then backed away, still clutching silver.

Doyle watched him go, face tight.

"They will write books about this," he said quietly. "About how we brought order."

I looked around at the smoke-stained walls, the dead bodies still uncollected in corners, the women moving like ghosts.

"Order," I repeated.

Doyle met my gaze.

"Doré served his master as you serve yours," he said. "And they killed him because he lost."

I nodded.

"His crime was losing," I replied.

The words tasted bitter.

As we walked away, the river kept flowing.

It flowed past Tipu's broken city.
It flowed past Doré's blood on stone.
It flowed past the men who would become rich from this victory.

Water does not care about empires.

Only people do.


# Chapter 31: The Reckoning

I had imagined the moment with the Deshmukh for years.

In some versions, he found me and cut me down like the dog he had always believed I was.

In others, I killed him and felt nothing, because men like me are supposed to be empty.

The truth was quieter.

The truth was older.

The truth arrived not with swords drawn but with two men standing amid ruins and admitting what time cannot erase.

---

The fort stank in the days after the assault.

Smoke still rose from buildings that had burned slowly, stubbornly, refusing to die even when victory had moved on. Corpses lay in corners where no one wanted to touch them. Flies gathered in black clusters.

The allied camp tried to organise looting into legality.

Officers issued receipts for stolen goods.
Clerks wrote lists.
Men pretended theft becomes honour if you record it.

I walked the streets once, alone, and regretted it.

A woman sat on a doorstep, rocking, eyes blank, whispering a prayer in a language I did not know.

No one helped her.

In war, civilians become scenery.

I turned away and found a quieter lane near the palace walls, where the stone was still warm from fire.

That was where the Deshmukh found me.

I heard hooves first, slow.

Then the sound of dismounting.

I turned and saw him standing in the mouth of the lane, two of his men behind him.

He looked smaller than he had in my memory.

Not weak.

Compressed by age.

His hair was grey.
His face lined.
His eyes still hard.

Those eyes had burned me long before any hot iron.

He stared at my forehead.

I did not cover it.

Covering is for men who still believe shame can be hidden.

"Bhalerao," he said.

Hearing my name in his mouth felt like being pulled backward through time.

I did not answer.

He stepped closer, boots crunching on debris.

"You are not dead," he said, voice flat.

"No," I replied.

One of his men shifted, hand on sword hilt.

The Deshmukh lifted a hand, stopping him.

He looked past my face for a moment, taking in the ruined fort, the smoke, the stench.

"This is where the tiger died," he said.

"Yes," I replied.

He nodded slowly, as if confirming a map.

"And this is where my hunt ends," he added.

The words should have relieved me.

They did not.

Relief is for men who believe an ending cleans what came before.

The Deshmukh stepped close enough that I could smell him.

Sweat.
Dust.
Old tobacco.

The smell of a man who had lived long enough to watch his anger turn into habit.

"You killed my son," he said, calmly, as if stating the weather.

I nodded.

"Yes."

He continued, voice steady.

"You killed a priest."

"Yes."

"Your father died for your sins."

The words struck harder than any blade.

My throat tightened.

I forced the truth out, because lies were pointless now.

"Yes," I said. "He did."

The Deshmukh's eyes narrowed.

For a moment I saw pain under the hardness, raw as exposed flesh.

"My son's wife was with child," he said. "A boy. Born after your knife. He grew up with my hatred as his inheritance."

I stared at him.

The boy would be a man now.

I had not thought of that.

That was another crime.

Not only death.

Time.

The Deshmukh's jaw worked as if chewing something bitter.

"I chased you across the Deccan," he said. "I spent gold that should have fed villages. I sent men to die for vengeance. I became smaller because I would not stop."

He looked at the ruins again, then back at me.

"And you," he said, contempt and disbelief mixed. "You became a soldier. A husband. A man with a house. You built a life."

His voice sharpened on the last words.

As if building was an insult to the dead.

I did not defend myself.

Defence is for men who think they deserve it.

"Yes," I said. "I did."

The Deshmukh stared at me for a long moment.

Then he said, quietly, "Do you think that makes you forgiven?"

The question was a blade, but I had learned how to stand still when blades are offered.

"No," I replied. "I do not think forgiveness exists."

His eyes flicked, a small movement, as if that answer surprised him.

"Good," he said, almost softly. "Then at least you are not a liar."

He stepped closer and raised a hand.

For an instant my body tensed, expecting violence.

He did not strike me.

He touched the scar on my forehead with one finger, just at the edge of the letters.

The contact burned, not with pain, but with memory.

"They marked you," he said.

"Yes."

"It was not enough," he replied.

The sentence held everything.

His son's death.
The priest's blood.
My father's sacrifice.
The years of pursuit.

Nothing had been enough.

He lowered his hand.

"I do not forgive," he said. "I will never forgive."

I nodded.

The Deshmukh exhaled slowly, and in that breath I heard fatigue.

"But I am done hunting," he finished.

The words fell between us like the end of a long sentence.

One of his men shifted again, uncomfortable, as if uncertain what to do when hatred stops being active.

The Deshmukh looked at his man and said, "We leave."

Then he looked at me one last time.

"Live with it," he said.

I did not answer.

There was no answer.

He turned and walked away through the ruin, his men following.

I watched his back until the smoke swallowed him.

When he was gone, the lane felt emptier than before, as if even hatred had been a kind of company.

I leaned against the wall and closed my eyes.

The brand throbbed.

Not from fresh fire.

From old fire that never fully cools.

The chase was over.

The weight was not.


# Chapter 32: What We Carry

When Tipu died, men expected the peninsula to exhale.

They expected the fear to drain out of the air like smoke after rain.

Instead, a different fear moved in.

Not a fear of rockets.

A fear of paperwork.

---

We returned to Travancore with the allied army's dust still in our hair.

The march south felt longer than the march north, because the purpose had been stripped away.

On the way up, every mile had been a step toward ending something.

On the way back, every mile was a step into a future we did not understand.

News travelled faster than we did.

Tipu was dead.
Seringapatam had fallen.
The Company was dividing Mysore like meat on a table.

By the time we reached Travancore's borders, villages had already begun to speak of the British as if they were kings.

Not openly.

Not yet.

But language changes first, and then everything else follows.

Kesava rode beside me in silence for most of the journey.

He was still himself, still hard, still restless, but something had settled in him after Seringapatam.

Not peace.

Knowledge.

"We killed the tiger," he said one evening as we camped near a stream, voice low. "And now we will have to feed whatever replaces it."

I did not answer.

Because I knew he was right.

---

Dharma Raja was already dead when we returned.

He had died in 1798, before the final war, before Tipu's fall, before the British could fully show what their protection meant.

I had saved his life at Alleppey.

I had not saved him from time.

The new Maharaja sat on the throne with a younger face and older eyes, already aware that his crown was weighed down by foreign attention.

When Kesavadas summoned me to court, I went in my uniform, scar uncovered, as always.

The hall smelled of oil lamps and wet cloth.

It smelled like a kingdom trying to keep its dignity while the world measured it.

Kesavadas stood near the throne, posture rigid.

He looked more tired than I remembered, as if every negotiation had taken a piece of him.

"Balan Pillai," he said quietly, using the name Travancore had given me. "You brought something back."

I had kept Tipu's tiger flag, the one taken in Kerala, stored and wrapped through years of uneasy peace and then the final war. I had kept it not as a trophy.

As a reminder.

I gestured to the guard carrying the bundle.

He stepped forward and unwrapped the cloth.

Green silk unfolded.

The tiger appeared, stitched in gold and black, mouth open forever, striding across fabric that had seen smoke.

The court murmured.

Some men smiled.
Some men looked away.

The new Maharaja leaned forward slightly, eyes narrowing, as if studying a beast he had only heard of.

Kesavadas spoke.

"This flag was captured in Travancore when Tipu retreated," he said. "It flew over our burned villages and our broken temples. Today it flies nowhere."

He nodded to me.

I stepped forward and held the pole upright.

The brand on my forehead burned under the court's gaze.

I did not lower my eyes.

I had lowered my eyes too much in my life.

"Your Highness," I said, voice steady, "Travancore still stands."

The Maharaja stared at the flag.

Then, unexpectedly, he looked at my face.

At the scar tissue.

At the letters that refused to fade.

He said quietly, "So do you."

For a moment I felt the old urge to laugh, bitter.

Standing is not the same as being whole.

But I nodded anyway, because kings do not ask for honest answers. They ask for symbols.

The flag was taken away and stored.

The court applauded politely.

Polite applause is how people pretend victory is simple.

---

When I returned home, Mariam was in the courtyard teaching our daughter to read.

The child sat cross-legged with a palm leaf in her lap, tongue caught between teeth in concentration.

Our son was chasing a chicken, laughing, unaware that empires existed.

Mariam looked up when I entered.

Her gaze went to my face.

Not to check the brand.

To check the man behind it.

She studied me for a long moment, then nodded.

You are here.

That was her language.

I sat on the verandah and watched my children move through sunlight.

They were neither Hindu nor Christian in the clean way priests prefer.

They were only themselves.

Mariam sat beside me with a cup of spiced water.

"Did they cheer?" she asked.

"They applauded," I replied.

Mariam snorted softly.

"Applause is cheap," she said. "Did they pay you?"

I almost smiled.

"No," I replied. "They paid the Company."

Mariam's expression hardened.

"Of course," she said.

The wind shifted.

From the north, faint, came the smell of smoke.

Not from war.

From kitchen fires.

From villages rebuilding.

From lives continuing, stubborn as weeds.

Kesava arrived at dusk, wet from rain, carrying a bottle.

He sat with me and drank, and for a while we spoke of small things.

Horses.
Old comrades.
The way the backwaters smell after a storm.

Then, as the bottle emptied, Kesava said quietly, "Do you remember what it was like, before all this?"

I looked out at the courtyard.

At my children.
At Mariam.
At the house we had built with laterite and stubbornness.

I thought of the Deccan.
Of temple stones.
Of the brand's heat.
Of Caspar's laughter.
Of Tipu's body carried through smoke.
Of Doré's blood on stone.

And I thought of Travancore in the years before, when fear was smaller and freedom felt like something you could hold in your hand.

"It was smaller," I said. "And more frightened. And more free."

Kesava nodded, eyes on the darkening sky.

"Yes," he said. "And now?"

I watched the first fireflies appear in the garden, tiny lights that did not care about kings.

Now, I thought, we will learn a different kind of war.

One fought with signatures and laws and men like Blackwood smiling.

I did not say it aloud.

Some truths are better left as silence between friends.

I drank the last of the spiced water and listened to my children laugh.

It was the only sound that felt like victory.


# Epilogue: Monsoon

The monsoon does not care about kings.

It comes when it comes, vast and indifferent, turning roads into rivers and fields into mirrors.

It washes the dust off leaves.
It fills wells.
It drowns the careless.

People like to say rain cleanses.

They say it because they need to believe something can be washed away.

They have never tried to scrub blood out of stone.

---

In the last years of my life, the brand on my forehead faded, but it never disappeared.

The letters softened at the edges.
The scar tissue flattened a little.

But if you looked, if you really looked, you could still read it.

BRAHMIN-KILLER.

Children in the courtyard knew their father's face.

They did not know its story.

That was my one mercy to them.

Not because they did not deserve truth.

Because truth is heavy, and children should not carry what men like me have carried.

Mariam disagreed.

She believed secrets rot.

She believed a child should know what the world is and what his parents have done inside it.

We argued about it more than once, softly, at night, when the house was quiet and the frogs loud.

In the end, we did what married people always do.

We postponed the hardest truth and pretended that postponement was a decision.

---

On a day when the rain fell hard enough to turn the courtyard into a shallow lake, I put on my cloak and walked out.

Mariam watched me from the doorway.

"Where are you going?" she asked.

I did not lie.

"To the grave," I replied.

She nodded.

She did not try to stop me.

She knew there are journeys a man must make alone.

The path to Ananthan's grave ran through trees that dripped constantly, each leaf a small reservoir. Water slid down trunks. Mud sucked at my feet.

The air smelled of wet earth and green life.

It smelled like the world being born again and again without asking permission.

Ananthan was buried on a small rise, away from the backwaters, under stones that had been placed with soldierly precision.

No excessive carving.
No priestly poetry.
Just a name and a date and a silence.

I stood in the rain and let it soak my hair, run down my face, fill the grooves of the scar tissue on my forehead.

I thought of him as I had first seen him, old and cold, reading my father's letter and looking at me as if I were something dragged up from a drain.

He had been right.

I had been worse than a drain.

Then I thought of him later, when he handed me the talwar and told me that a soldier's weapon is not a prize, it is a debt.

I had paid some of that debt.

Not all.

No man pays all of it.

I knelt in the mud and placed my palm against the stone.

My hand shook slightly.

Not from fear.

From age.

And from memory.

Three ghosts stood behind me, as they always had.

The pujari, startled, bleeding on temple stone.
Vikram, brave and foolish, stepping into my knife.
Dhanaji, my father, dying so that his worthless son could run.

I had carried them through campaigns and across rivers.

I had carried them into my house.

I had carried them into my children's laughter.

The rain did not wash them away.

Rain does not wash ghosts.

It only makes them colder.

I thought of Caspar De Lannoy laughing at death.
Of Hendrik's face when the fire finally took his brother.
Of Dharma Raja bleeding into a boat and still managing to be king.
Of Tipu's body carried through smoke, a brave and terrible man reduced to flesh.
Of Doré's blood on stone and Blackwood's smile saying civilisation.

And then I thought of Mariam, stubborn and sharp and alive, building a life beside mine without pretending either of us were clean.

I rose, mud on my knees, rain in my eyes.

When I returned home, the house smelled of rice and wood smoke and damp cloth.

Mariam was by the hearth, stirring a pot, hair loose because the rain had stolen the braid's discipline.

She looked up at me.

Her eyes went to my face.

Not the brand.

The man.

She handed me a cloth without a word.

I wiped rain from my cheeks and stood for a moment watching my children, older now, moving through the room with the casual certainty of people who believe home is permanent.

On a shelf above the hearth, the jeweled knife lay wrapped in cloth.

Stolen from my dead father.

Cleaned.
Oiled.
Waiting.

For years I had told myself it was a reminder.

Now I understood it was a warning.

The knife had shaped me once.

It could shape my children if I failed them.

Mariam caught my gaze on the shelf and said quietly, "Do not let them become you."

Her voice held no accusation.

Only fear, the honest kind.

I nodded.

Outside, the rain hammered the roof.

Inside, the fire held.

Some things do not wash.

Some things we carry.

For as long as we live, and in the stories that outlast us.
