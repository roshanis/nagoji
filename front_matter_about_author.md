# About the Author

RV Menon is a software engineer who grew up between Kerala and Maharashtra, two lands whose histories intertwine in this novel. The stories in these pages draw from memories shared by his father, grandparents, uncles, aunts, mother-in-law, and wife, woven together with historical research into a narrative that honours both family lore and the documented past. He has poured his love into this book to bring these stories to everyone.

*Horse of the Servant* is his first novel.
