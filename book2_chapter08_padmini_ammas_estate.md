# Book II, Chapter 8: Padmini Amma's Estate

The first time I saw Padmini Amma's house, I thought they had brought me to a temple by mistake.

Not one of the great stone temples I knew from the Deccan, with shikharas that clawed at the sky and carved gods staring down from high walls. This place had no towering spires, no massive gateways. It sprawled low and wide beneath the palms, its tiled roofs sloping gently, its carved wooden beams dark with oil and age. Yet everything about it said power.

Power in the neatness of the courtyards, swept clean before dawn. Power in the thickness of the granary walls, mounds of paddy stacked inside like quiet promises. Power in the way men with spears stood not at the outer gate, but under the shade of the inner verandahs, where cool air and authority met.

We rode in under an arch woven with coconut fronds and mango leaves. Someone had hung oil lamps there though the sun was high, wicks smoking gently, scenting the air with a faint tang of burnt ghee.

“Do not look for the sardar,” Ibrahim murmured beside me as his horse's hooves clicked on the stone threshold. “Here, the house does not belong to the man who sleeps in the front room. It belongs to the name on the matrilineal line. You will see.”

The courtyard we entered was long and rectangular, edged with pillared verandahs. On one side women sat sorting pepper berries on woven mats, their fingers moving with practised speed, their bangles clinking softly. On the other side, near a well, boys practised with short spears under the eye of an older man who barked corrections in Malayalam.

All of them, women and boys both, looked up as we dismounted. Their eyes slid over Ibrahim, whom they knew, then settled on me.

A stranger. A Maratha. A man who had washed up from Portuguese wreckage and now arrived here on a horse instead of a stretcher.

At the far end of the courtyard a woman stood.

She was not young, but no one would have called her old. Her hair, thick and black, was braided and coiled at the nape of her neck. Gold gleamed at her ears and around her neck, not in great heavy chains, but in simple pieces that looked as if they had been worn for work as much as for ceremony. Her sari was cotton, not silk, hitched up around her ankles in the style of someone who might walk through fields.

She leaned lightly on a long stick that could have been a staff or a cane, depending on who held it.

“Sawant,” Ibrahim said under his breath. “Padmini Amma.”

I bowed my head slightly as we approached, the way I might greet a landholding Patil in my own country. Not a deep court bow, but more than a nod to an equal.

“Amma,” Ibrahim said aloud, dismounting. “This is the rider I spoke of. The one the sea and the Portuguese fought over.”

Her gaze travelled from my feet to my face. It lingered on my hands, still wrapped in thin linen, on the faint outline of the brand under my sleeve, on the worn leather of my belt.

“The one who survived,” she said. Her Malayalam was slow enough that I could follow. “The sea spits out strange things.”

Switching to Hindustani, she added, “You understand me, Sawant?”

“Enough to know when I am being insulted, Amma,” I said. “And enough to know when I am being measured.”

One corner of her mouth curved.

“Good. Men who cannot tell the difference do not live long here.”

She gestured with the stick.

“Come. Leave the horses to the boys. If they can handle pepper bales, they can handle saddles.”

A boy of perhaps twelve ran forward and took my gelding's reins. He handled the animal with an easy calm that spoke of long familiarity. The horse snorted once, then allowed itself to be led away.

Padmini Amma walked with us along the verandah, the stick tapping lightly against the stone.

“The king sends you here to be near horse,” she said. “And near a house that owes him more than it likes to admit. Clever man. He knows that understanding an estate is as important as understanding a charge.”

“I am a soldier,” I said. “I count men, hooves, distances.”

“And who owns the land those hooves cross?” she asked mildly. “Who feeds the men you count? Whose pepper pays for their powder?”

We passed open doorways that looked into cool rooms. In one, two women bent over palm leaf bundles, counting and tying. In another, an elderly man with a thin white beard traced lines on a cloth map with his finger, lips moving as if reciting something.

“My grandmother slept in that room,” Padmini Amma said, nodding toward the map. “Her brother ran away with a dancer. Her sons went to fight for different chiefs. This house stayed with her sisters and their daughters. The men come and go. The name stays here.”

“In the Deccan,” I said, “we inherit through the father's line. A man's field is his son's.”

She tapped the floor with her stick.

“If your son's wife hates you, does that field still feel like safety?” she asked. “Here, a child is born into a house that will not forget him. Or her. This is our way. It has kept pepper flowing and swords sharp through more kings than I care to count.”

We reached a smaller inner courtyard, shaded by a large jackfruit tree. A stone platform sat under it, worn smooth by generations of use. From somewhere beyond its low wall came the sound of steel ringing on steel and the grunt of bodies in practice.

“Kalari,” she said, seeing my glance. “Our boys and some of our girls train there. Sticks, swords, dagger. When the king calls, they are ready. When the king forgets us, they are also ready.”

There was no threat in her tone. Only a statement of fact, laid on the ground like a tool.

She gestured for us to sit on the platform. A girl brought water in brass tumblers. Another followed with a plate of sliced fruit and fried snacks. The ease with which they moved, the way they did not avert their eyes from me, the way Padmini Amma accepted their presence without comment, all of it was different from what I had grown up with.

In my village, women worked hard. They walked far for water, bent over fields, carried wood. But in the courtyard where men in armour sat, they moved like shadows at the edge, leaving food and vanishing. Here they flowed through the centre, talking, laughing, listening in.

“The king thinks highly of you,” Padmini Amma said, once the boy with the water had gone. “He put you on his sand, under his eye. He did not send you straight to the northern marches or to some pepper godown. That means he has not yet decided whether you are a spear for his hand or a knife that might cut it.”

“I am still an experiment,” I said. “He told me so himself.”

“He is honest, then,” she said. “Good. It makes it easier to decide how much to trust you.”

She watched me as she bit into a slice of jackfruit. The sticky juice glistened on her fingers before she wiped them on a cloth.

“You have a family,” she said. “Back in your hills.”

“Yes,” I said. The word tasted heavier than jackfruit. “Parents. A younger brother. Some fields that do not know whether I am alive.”

“And a wife?” she asked.

“No.”

“Why not?”

In the Deccan, such a question from a woman I had just met would have been unthinkable. Here it came like another test, dropped into the space between us.

“The life I chose did not lend itself to regular hearths,” I said. “I rode where the Peshwa's orders sent me. I did not think it fair to ask a woman to wait for a man who might ride into Portuguese guns one morning and never ride back.”

“You assume she would wait,” Padmini Amma said dryly. “Here, if a man does not return, the house continues. A girl's worth does not hang on whether some wanderer honours his promises. Perhaps your hills should learn from that.”

I could not help a short laugh.

“You speak freely, Amma.”

“I own this land,” she said. “Why should I not”

She leaned back, studying me.

“You will be billeted here for a time,” she said. “Your horses will graze in our fields. Your men will eat from grain we grew. You will ride from this gate when the king calls. That makes you part of this house's story, whether you like it or not.”

“Houses have long memories,” I said.

“And longer tongues,” she replied. “They talk about men who think they ride above them. Remember that.”

She paused, then added, “You will meet one of those tongues soon. The king has asked our Velinadu kin to send a representative to a gathering. They send a princess. Revathi Bayi. She has more opinions than I have pepper vines. If you truly want to understand this kingdom, you will have to listen to her as carefully as you listen to Ramayyan.”

The name was not entirely new. I had heard it on the road to Travancore, in taverns and at shrines, attached to stories of a sharp tongued royal woman who refused to act grateful when Europeans bowed.

“She supports the king?” I asked.

Padmini Amma's expression shifted, just enough to be seen.

“She supports Travancore,” she said. “Not always the same thing as supporting its current occupant. You will discover this.”

I thought of Marthanda Varma on his low platform in the coastal hall, spear at his shoulder, maps at his feet. A man who had carved power from a fractured land. In my world, such a man expected his nobles to fall in line or fall in the field.

“He allows her to speak against him?” I said.

“He allows what he cannot easily stop,” Padmini Amma said. “The Velinadu line is old. Older than his throne. Older than his reforms. Older than Dutch and Portuguese ships on this coast. And they are not the only ones. The old Eight Houses on the marches once thought themselves kings too, until he broke them. You outsiders see one crown. We see many layered on the same land. Sometimes they sit well together. Sometimes they cut.”

The kalari sounds beyond the wall rose and fell. The thuds of feet, the hiss of breath, the smack of sticks training muscles to remember.

“Do you ever tire of it?” I asked suddenly.

She glanced at me.

“Of what?”

“Of holding all this in your hands,” I said. “Land, men, accounts, temple obligations. Of being the one whose name sits at the top of every ledger.”

She was quiet long enough that I wondered if I had stepped too far.

“There are days,” she said at last, “when I would like to wake up and have someone else decide which field to flood and which debt to forgive. But if I hand this house to a man whose first instinct is to please another king, my daughters and their daughters become guests in their own courtyard. I am selfish enough to prefer my own burdens to their chains.”

Her mouth twisted.

“Besides,” she added, “if I did not enjoy it at least a little, would I tease you as often as I do?”

The kalari shouts rose again, punctuating her point.

“When do we go to Velinadu?” I asked.

“In two days,” she said. “You will come as my guest, not as the king's experiment. That will confuse people. Confusion is useful.”

She rose, using the stick more as a symbol than as a support.

“Rest now,” she said. “Wash the salt from your skin. Look at how our men and women move through this house. Tomorrow we walk the fields. I will show you where your horses will chew and where they will trample. After that, we will see whether you can speak to a princess without putting your Deccan boot in your mouth.”

As she walked away, the women in the courtyard parted without being told, then closed again behind her. Men with ledgers stepped aside, then resumed their counts. A young girl carrying firewood paused to watch me for a heartbeat, eyes bright, then hurried on.

I sat alone on the stone platform under the jackfruit tree, listening to the layered sounds of the estate.

In Goa, power had been simple. It wore a uniform, spoke Portuguese, carried a crucifix and a gun. In Pune, power wore silk and pearls and spoke in measured Marathi behind carved screens. Here, power sounded like pepper being sifted, like a woman's stick tapping stone, like boys shouting in a training pit while a jackfruit tree dropped sticky fruit into waiting hands.

The king had given me horses and wet sand. Padmini Amma offered something less obvious and perhaps more dangerous.

A house that remembered. A house whose women spoke.

If I was to survive this southern kingdom, I would have to learn its female tongues as carefully as I learned the Dutch drill manuals we captured from broken forts.

Two days to learn how not to offend a princess.

I had faced Portuguese interrogations and Arabian Sea storms. Somehow, this felt like the more delicate task.
