# Chapter 15: The House of Velinadu

Revathi Bayi's house was a battlefield without blood.

Men fought there with seating.
With smiles.
With who spoke first and who was forced to wait.

I had grown up in the Deccan where power is loud. Men shout. Men boast. Men kill to prove a point.

In Velinadu, power was quieter.

Quieter power is more frightening.

It leaves no obvious enemy to stab.

---

Revathi took us to Velinadu when she wanted the court to remember she still mattered.

Her palanquin moved along the backwater roads, guards on either side, umbrellas above, servants behind. The land was lush, the air heavy with damp heat. Coconut palms leaned over water like men listening to secrets.

Velinadu was not a fort.

It was an estate, a cluster of halls and courtyards surrounded by pepper vines and rice fields, guarded by men loyal to Revathi, not the king. Women moved through corridors with practised calm, carrying trays, carrying messages, carrying knowledge.

Kesava walked differently here.

Not stiff with duty.

Comfortable.

This was his grandmother's world.

It belonged to him the way my father's house had belonged to me once, before I burned it with my choices.

Revathi received visitors all day.

Nair lords from nearby lands.
Merchants with spice-stained fingers.
Temple officials with oil on their foreheads and arrogance in their eyes.

They bowed.

They smiled.

They offered gifts that were really questions.

How strong are you now?
How weak is the king?
How much does the Company know?

I stood behind Revathi's seat with the other guards and tried to look like a wall.

Walls do not react.

Walls only hold.

It was harder than spear drill.

A man can swing steel honestly.

He cannot swing his face.

A merchant stepped forward once, a thick man with rings on his fingers and pepper dust in the folds of his cloth.

He bowed to Revathi and spoke in Malayalam with a smile that looked friendly.

"Lady," he said, "there are rumours from the north. Hyder's men are moving again."

Hyder.

The name sat on the air like smoke.

Revathi's face did not change.

"Rumours are always moving," she replied.

The merchant smiled wider.

"Then Travancore will need powder," he said.

Powder.

He said the word like prayer.

Revathi's eyes flicked to him, sharp.

"Travancore always needs powder," she said. "Travancore also needs honest merchants."

The merchant's smile tightened.

He bowed again and stepped back.

Revathi turned slightly, as if adjusting her seat.

Her voice dropped, meant only for those close.

"Men sell fear like spice," she murmured.

Kesava's jaw tightened.

Revathi's gaze flicked to me.

"Remember that," she said quietly. "Do not buy fear. Make others buy yours."

I swallowed.

It was a lesson, not in combat, in power.

Later that day, a temple official entered, a Brahmin with sharp forehead marks and a mouth that looked permanently displeased.

He bowed, but his eyes slid past Revathi to my face.

The brand.

His lip curled.

"Lady," he said, voice dripping with sweetness, "your household has gained interesting servants."

Revathi smiled, as if delighted.

"Yes," she replied. "I collect interesting things."

The Brahmin's eyes narrowed.

"A man marked as a priest-killer should not stand in a holy house," he said.

Holy house.

He meant Revathi's hall.

He meant the land.

He meant the world.

My hands clenched.

I forced them open.

Revathi's smile did not change.

"Do you see him standing in your temple?" she asked gently.

The Brahmin stiffened.

"No," he said.

"Then your temple is safe," Revathi replied.

The Brahmin's mouth tightened.

Revathi leaned forward slightly, and her voice, still gentle, sharpened.

"If the king needs his sword," she said, "the priests will find a way to tolerate the man holding it."

The Brahmin's face flushed.

He bowed too quickly.

Revathi's eyes glittered.

"Tell your friends in the temple council," she added, as if making conversation, "that Travancore's walls are not built with prayers alone."

The Brahmin backed away.

When he was gone, Kesava hissed.

"You enjoy this," he muttered.

Revathi glanced at him.

"Yes," she admitted. "It keeps me young."

Then she looked at me.

"And it teaches you," she said.

I stared, confused.

Revathi's voice lowered.

"They will always try to make your brand into their weapon," she said. "If you react like an animal, you give them the weapon. If you stand still, you turn their disgust into their own humiliation."

She leaned back.

"Power is often nothing more than patience," she finished.

That night, as I lay on a mat in Velinadu's guard quarters, I stared at the ceiling and thought about patience.

Patience had saved Ismail Khan's caravan.
Patience had saved me from opium more than once.
Patience had kept my hands from Kesava's throat.

Perhaps patience was the weapon my father had tried to teach me and failed.

In the morning, Revathi sent me with Kesava to deliver messages to a nearby fort commander, a small task meant to show me the shape of her network.

On the road, Kesava rode beside me in silence for a long time.

Then he spoke, voice grudging.

"You did not react," he said.

I glanced at him.

"To the Brahmin?" I asked.

Kesava nodded.

"Most men would have," he said.

I swallowed.

"I have reacted before," I replied. "It killed my father."

Kesava's jaw tightened.

He looked away toward the backwater.

"Do not make me feel sorry for you," he muttered.

I almost laughed.

It was a strange thing to say to a man with a brand on his face.

But I understood what he meant.

Pity is another way of looking down.

So I kept my voice flat.

"Then do not," I said.

Kesava's mouth twitched.

"Good," he replied.

We rode on.

In Velinadu, I had learned a new kind of lesson.

Not how to strike.

How to endure being watched.

How to let other men show their ugliness first.

Revathi's house was a battlefield.

And patience was the blade.
