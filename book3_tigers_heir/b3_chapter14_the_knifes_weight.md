# Chapter 14: The Knife's Weight

The jeweled knife came back to me in silence.

No ceremony.

No forgiveness wrapped around it.

Just metal and stones and the weight of what it had cost.

---

Ananthan summoned me after dawn drill, when my wrists still ached from wooden practice and sweat still clung to my back.

He did not summon Kesava.

That alone made my stomach tighten.

Ananthan's hall was cool and dim. Oil lamps burned low. The air smelled of old wood and dried flowers, the smell of a house that has learned to keep its emotions quiet.

Ananthan sat on a low seat with a cloth map spread beside him.

The knife lay on the table, unwrapped.

The stones caught lamplight and threw it back in small hard gleams.

My throat went dry.

Ananthan did not look at the knife first.

He looked at my face.

"Do you still crave it?" he asked.

I blinked.

For a heartbeat I did not understand.

Then I did.

Opium.

The craving flared in me at the word, like a wound pressed.

I forced my hands to stay open at my sides.

"Yes," I admitted.

Ananthan nodded.

"Good," he said. "A man who lies about hunger lies about everything."

He tapped the table once with his finger.

"Sit," he ordered.

I sat on the floor near the table, the way a servant sits. Not across from him like an equal.

Ananthan watched me for a moment.

"Do you know what a knife is?" he asked.

I almost laughed.

"A weapon," I said.

Ananthan's eyes narrowed.

"It is a choice," he corrected. "A man draws it when he cannot solve a problem with his mouth."

The sentence struck.

My mouth had failed me at the temple.

My mouth had failed me at the execution ground.

My mouth had failed me every time I chose the quick solution.

Ananthan's gaze flicked to the knife.

"This knife," he said, "was given in friendship."

He looked at me again.

"You took it in theft," he continued.

My chest tightened.

"It was my father's," I said, and the defence sounded weak even as I spoke it.

Ananthan's voice stayed flat.

"Your father never stole it," he said. "That is the difference between you and him."

The words cut clean.

I swallowed.

"I know," I whispered.

Ananthan leaned forward slightly.

"Then say it properly," he said.

I stared at the floor.

The lamplight made the wood grain look like scars.

My throat tightened.

"I stole it," I said.

The words tasted of bile.

Ananthan nodded.

"Good," he said again.

He lifted the knife and held it out toward me.

I did not take it.

My hands stayed frozen.

Ananthan's eyes narrowed.

"Take it," he ordered.

I forced my hand to move.

My fingers closed around the hilt.

The knife was heavier than I remembered, as if the years and the guilt had added weight to the metal.

Ananthan watched my grip.

"Do not draw it in anger," he said.

I nodded.

"Do not draw it to impress," he continued.

I nodded again.

"Do not draw it to punish a priest who insults you," he added, and for a moment I heard amusement under the hardness.

I felt heat rise in my neck.

Ananthan's gaze stayed sharp.

"If you draw it, know why," he finished. "And know the cost."

He tapped my forehead cloth lightly with two fingers.

"Your face is already a cost," he said. "Do not add to it without purpose."

My grip tightened on the knife.

I wanted to say thank you.

The words stuck.

Ananthan did not look like a man who wanted thanks.

So I did something else.

I reached into my shirt and pulled out my father's letter.

The paper was worn at the folds. The wax seal had long been broken, but I had kept it like a relic.

I held it out.

Ananthan stared at it for a moment.

"Why?" he asked.

My throat tightened.

"Because it is his voice," I said. "And I have nothing else."

Ananthan took the letter and held it as if it might burn him.

He did not open it.

He already knew what it said.

He looked at me and spoke quietly.

"A father can die for a son," he said. "That does not make the son clean."

I nodded, because that truth had become my shadow.

Ananthan handed the letter back.

"Keep it," he said. "Read it when you want to be weak."

Weak.

The word did not insult me in his mouth.

It sounded like another piece of doctrine.

Ananthan leaned back.

"Go," he said.

I rose, knife at my belt, letter against my chest, and walked out of the hall.

The yard was bright with daylight now. Men were drilling. Horses were being watered. Life continued.

I found a quiet corner near the stables and unwrapped the knife again.

The stones glinted.

My father had carried this knife as a symbol of friendship.

I had carried it as stolen loot.

Now I carried it as something else.

Not inheritance.

Debt.

I pressed my thumb to the hilt and felt the small raised pattern where Nagoji's hand had once rested.

The knife was not a weapon.

It was a reminder.

Every time I drew it, I would be drawing my father's death too.

That weight did not make me noble.

It made me careful.
