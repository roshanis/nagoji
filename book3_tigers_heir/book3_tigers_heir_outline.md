# Blood and Thrones, Book 3: Tiger's Heir

## Working Title: Tiger's Heir

### Core Premise

Bhalerao is the ruined son of a Maratha cavalryman. An opium addict, he robs a village temple and kills both the pujari and the Deshmukh's son who tries to stop him. Branded before execution with "BRAHMIN-KILLER" burned into his forehead, he is rescued at the execution ground by his father, who dies in his place. Carrying three deaths, unbearable guilt, and a scar that announces his crime to everyone he meets, Bhalerao flees south with his father's letter and the jeweled knife Nagoji once gave Dhanaji.

He arrives in Travancore as the lowest form of man, but Travancore is a kingdom that remakes outsiders into weapons. Over decades, Bhalerao earns trust, finds love with Mariam, a Syrian Catholic refugee of Tipu's Malabar campaigns, saves Dharma Raja in a brutal skirmish near Alleppey, captures Tipu's tiger flag in Kerala, and eventually rides with the allied army to Seringapatam, where the Tiger of Mysore falls and victory tastes like smoke.

### Narrator

**Bhalerao**, telling his story in first person past tense.

His voice is:

- Haunted by guilt and the permanence of the brand on his face
- Practical in violence, suspicious of piety
- Softening only when he speaks of Mariam and the house they build
