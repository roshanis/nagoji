# Chapter 4: Arcot

The Carnatic felt like another world.

The Deccan is hard. Its hills are brown. Its rivers shrink to threads in summer. The wind carries dust and the smell of dry dung. Men speak as if every sentence is a negotiation.

The Carnatic was flatter, hotter, louder. The air tasted of salt even when the sea was far away. The language shifted under my feet. I could still bargain. I could still swear. But the words did not land the same way.

I left Ismail Khan's caravan at Bijapur with a small bundle of rice and a small handful of coins and the kind of gratitude that makes a man feel ashamed because he knows he does not deserve it.

Shankar clapped my shoulder once.

"Do not die stupidly," he said.

It was his blessing.

Then the caravan moved on and the road swallowed me again.

---

I reached Arcot with blistered feet and a head full of lies.

Arcot was the Nawab's city, a place of walls and gardens and debt. The Nawab ruled in name. The English Company ruled in practice. Men bowed to the Nawab in the day and wrote to Madras at night.

I did not understand the politics at first. Politics is just another word for hunger dressed in silk.

What I understood were horses.

In Arcot, horses were everywhere, because war was everywhere. Cavalry mounts stood in stables, ribs showing through hide, their eyes dull from hard riding. Officers argued over fodder prices as if arguing could conjure grass from dust.

I walked into a stable yard near the fort and offered my hands.

The stable master was a Tamil man named Rangan with a scar down his cheek and a face that looked carved from exhaustion.

He watched me pick up a horse's hoof and clean it without flinching.

"Where are you from?" he asked in broken Marathi.

"Pune," I lied.

Rangan's eyes flicked to my forehead cloth.

"Fire," he said, not caring.

"Fire," I agreed.

He nodded.

"Work," he said.

That was Arcot's only question.

So I worked.

I shoveled dung. I carried water. I brushed sweat-stiff hides until my arms burned. I slept in the corner of the stable yard with the smell of horses in my nose, and that smell was the closest thing to comfort I had left.

At night, when the opium craving rose like a tide, I pressed my forehead to the stable wall and breathed until the wave passed.

Sometimes it did not pass.

Sometimes it only withdrew far enough to return later.

---

The English arrived in Arcot on the third day.

I saw them first from the stable yard gate, marching in a line that looked too neat for the dusty road. Red coats. White crossbelts. Drums. Sepoys in Company service walking beside them, their faces set, their eyes scanning.

The English officers rode at the side, pale faces under broad hats, their posture stiff, their hands gloved as if the land itself might stain them.

They looked at the city as if they were already measuring it.

I had heard of the English.

Everyone in the Carnatic had heard of them.

They were like a new kind of merchant, one who carried cannon with the account book.

One sepoy sergeant paused near the stable yard and called out an order in a language that was neither Marathi nor Tamil, but something clipped and sharp.

The sepoys responded instantly.

Discipline.

Not the loose discipline of Maratha horsemen.

The drilled discipline of men taught to move as one body.

I felt a chill.

I had run from a Deshmukh's men.

These men looked like they belonged to something larger than a Deshmukh.

Rangan spat into the dust.

"Company dogs," he muttered.

Then he looked at me and shrugged.

"They pay," he added.

In Arcot, that was enough.

---

The stable yard had a boy named Muthu who had come north from the pepper coast.

He was small, quick, and homesick in a way that made him talk too much.

On the fifth day, as we watered horses, he asked where I was going.

The letter pressed against my chest like a hand.

"South," I said carefully.

Muthu's eyes lit up.

"Travancore?" he asked.

The name sounded strange in my mouth. "Yes," I lied, then realised it was not a lie.

Muthu grinned.

"In Travancore, the king is still the king," he said. "Not like here. Here the Nawab bows to the English and pretends he does not."

He leaned close, conspiratorial.

"In Travancore, they broke the Dutch," he whispered, as if the story was magic. "They broke them at Colachel. My uncle says the sea ran red."

Colachel.

The word meant nothing to me yet, but the way Muthu said it made it feel like a place where outsiders learned humility.

Muthu continued, eager.

"They have a foreign captain too," he said. "A Dutchman. Or French. People say he built their forts."

Foreign captain.

The letter in my chest felt heavier.

Nagoji Sawant had become Ananthan Pillai.

A Maratha had become a Travancore man.

Perhaps that was possible.

Perhaps that was the only kind of miracle left.

---

The hunters found Arcot the way they found everything.

With money.

On the seventh day, as I carried a sack of fodder, I saw a man standing near the stable yard gate.

He was not Tamil. Not Telugu. Not local.

He wore a turban tied in a Maratha style, and he held himself like a horseman even on foot.

His gaze swept the yard with the practised calm of a man searching for something valuable.

Then his eyes caught mine.

For a heartbeat, nothing moved.

Then his gaze dropped to my forehead cloth.

His mouth tightened.

He stepped forward.

My stomach turned to water.

I set the fodder sack down slowly, as if I had all the time in the world.

The man came closer.

I saw the scar at the edge of his jaw. A sword cut, old.

He had been in fights.

He knew what he was looking for.

"Govind," I told myself.

Horse trader.

Stable fire.

I forced a smile.

"Brother," I said in Marathi. "Looking for work?"

The man did not smile back.

"Looking for a face," he replied.

His hand moved slightly, not to a weapon, to the cloth on his own forehead, a gesture that made my skin crawl.

He knew.

Behind him, two more men appeared at the gate.

One hundred mohurs had brought them far.

I glanced toward the yard.

Horses.
Stalls.
Ropes.

No open road.

If they cornered me here, the stable yard would become my grave.

Rangan looked up from a horse's flank and saw the men.

His eyes narrowed.

He had seen hunters before. Every stable man has.

Muthu froze with a bucket in his hands.

The hunter stepped closer.

"Show me your face," he said.

I felt the brand throb under cloth as if it heard its name.

I did not move.

The hunter reached out.

I struck first.

I swung the fodder sack hard into his chest.

The sack hit him like a body.

He stumbled back, startled, arms flailing.

I ran.

I ran toward the horses.

Rangan shouted something in Tamil, sharp and furious.

The hunters shouted too.

I grabbed the nearest horse by the rein and hauled myself onto its back without saddle, bare feet gripping, body low.

The horse bucked once, startled by my weight, then surged forward because horses understand panic.

I kicked it toward the yard gate.

A hunter tried to grab the reins and missed.

The horse's shoulder slammed him aside.

We burst out into the road.

Behind me, men shouted for the Company sepoys.

That was the danger.

If the English caught me, they would not care about Deshmukhs or temples. They would care about disorder. They would hand me over to whoever had the right paper.

I rode hard through Arcot's streets, ducking under hanging cloth, splashing through puddles, hearing the city wake in my wake.

People shouted.
Dogs barked.
A vendor cursed as I knocked over a basket of limes.

Ahead, a line of sepoys turned the corner, muskets in hand, moving with drilled speed.

The sergeant at their head saw me, eyes narrowing.

He raised his hand to signal stop.

I did not stop.

The sergeant's gaze flicked to my forehead cloth and then to the hunters spilling into the street behind.

For a heartbeat, I saw calculation in his face.

Not mercy.

Calculation.

He shouted an order.

The sepoys stepped aside.

Not out of kindness.

Out of indifference.

Let the local men kill each other. It was not the Company's problem yet.

I rode through the gap and out of Arcot before the hunters could close it.

The horse's flanks heaved. My hands shook.

Behind me, the city swallowed the shouting.

Ahead of me, the road south stretched long and empty.

I did not stop until the sun was high and my throat tasted of blood.

Arcot had been a refuge for a week.

Now it was another place where my face had nearly become my death.

Travancore was still far.

But it was the only direction the letter allowed.
