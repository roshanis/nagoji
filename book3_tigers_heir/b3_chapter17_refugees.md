# Chapter 17: Refugees

By the time Tipu's name began to travel south in earnest, I had learned that war does not arrive first as an army.

It arrives as paperwork.
It arrives as empty granaries.
It arrives as rumours that make men sleep with a hand on a knife.

Then it arrives as people.

---

The first column I saw came down the northern road in the grey light before sunrise.

At a distance it looked like a procession, the way villagers move for a festival, bundles balanced, children clinging, old men leaning on sticks. Then the wind shifted and carried the smell to me.

Smoke, old and ground into cloth.
Fear-sweat that no bath can wash.
Rot from wounds kept wrapped too long.

They had walked for days. Some had walked without shoes. Their soles were split and caked with mud the colour of dried blood. A woman carried a cooking pot on her head and a baby at her hip, and the baby did not cry. A man with a shaved crown and a strip of cloth tied around his arm walked like a sleepwalker, eyes on nothing.

When they saw our horses, the line faltered.

Not because they were relieved.

Because soldiers meant decisions made by men with weapons.

Kesava rode up beside me, posture straight as if that could keep chaos at arm's length.

"Open the ground," he ordered our men. "Water first. Then food. No pushing."

Our small post was nothing but a watch hut, a ditch, and a few palm trunks set as barriers. We had been placed there to spot raids and carry messages. We had not been built to swallow a river of people.

I stared at the column and felt a familiar discomfort crawl under my skin.

Refugees look at you the way a hungry dog looks at a kitchen door. Not begging. Measuring the chance of being kicked.

They stopped at the edge of our ditch and waited.

The ones in front were Syrian Christians, *Nasrani*, their crosses visible on cords at their throats. Some clutched palm-leaf bundles as if they were sacred. One man carried a battered wooden crucifix like a standard, the Christ figure chipped and dark with soot. Behind them were Hindus from the same villages, and behind them again a scatter of Muslims who looked as afraid as anyone else. Tipu's armies did not only burn what was convenient. They burned what resisted.

An old priest stepped forward, beard white, eyes bloodshot from smoke and sleeplessness. A small silver cross hung against his chest, dull in the morning light.

He took one look at my forehead and stopped as if he had hit a wall.

The brand was not fresh anymore. Years had given the scar tissue a darker, rougher texture. But the letters still announced themselves.

BRAHMIN-KILLER.

The priest swallowed.

He did not make the sign of the cross.
He did not spit.
He did not flinch away.

He simply looked tired.

"We need water," he said in Malayalam that carried a coastal accent. His voice cracked on the word, as if even asking was painful.

Kesava nodded to a man with a bucket.

I dismounted and walked forward, slow, hands open.

When you move too fast around people who have fled soldiers, your speed becomes another weapon.

The first child who drank from our pot vomited the water back up. It was not disgust. It was the stomach of a body that had learned to brace for hunger.

The mother wiped the child's mouth with the edge of her sari and looked at me as if she expected me to punish her.

I looked away.

Shame is contagious. It spreads from the guilty to anyone who stands too close.

---

We opened the ground beside the road and began to build a camp out of whatever we had.

Palm fronds for shade.
Rope for crude lines.
Two sentries at the edge so that fear did not become a riot.

The first day we fed them rice from our stores and watched the line lengthen with every hour.

On the second day, Raja Kesavadas arrived with clerks, porters, and a face that looked carved from calm.

He was not dressed like a warrior. White cloth. Clean hands. The kind of man who could decide whether a village lived or starved by moving ink across paper.

He stood beside me and watched a woman clean a wound on her husband's thigh with water that would not be clean enough.

"How many?" he asked.

I did not know the exact number. I knew the weight.

"Too many," I said.

Kesavadas nodded, as if that was an acceptable measurement.

He gestured toward the column still arriving.

"They are bringing stories," he said. "I need the stories separated from the panic. Panic spreads faster than fever."

He said it the way a man speaks of weather.

I watched the refugees' faces and thought of my own panic, years ago, on a road south, sickness sweating out of me, hunters behind me, the brand burning under cloth.

"What happened up there?" I asked.

Kesavadas looked at me.

Not at my brand. At my eyes.

"Tipu is taking Malabar," he said quietly. "Not only land. People. He wants the coast obedient. He wants the trade obedient. He wants faith obedient."

He nodded toward the crosses.

"Some villages refused," he continued. "Some men fought. Some priests refused to bend. The response was what you would expect from a ruler who believes God has signed his orders."

The temple stones in my own village came back to me, slick with blood, my knife in my hand. I saw the priest's face, shocked, not angry, only surprised that Dhanaji's son could fall so far.

Kesavadas spoke again.

"They are deporting people inland. Forced marches. Conversions. Those who resist are made examples."

He paused, eyes on a boy carrying a younger sister, her head lolling with fever.

"And now they are coming here," he finished. "Because Travancore still has walls."

Walls.

Even the word tasted like responsibility.

Kesavadas turned to the clerks.

"Names," he said. "Villages. Occupations. Languages. We cannot feed everyone forever, but we can decide who can help feed the rest."

He looked back at me.

"You," he said, matter-of-fact. "You have seen hunger and you have seen violence. You will keep this camp from turning into a stampede."

It was not praise.

It was assignment.

In Travancore, that is what passes for trust.

---

By the third day, the camp smelled like human bodies pressed too close.

Sweat.
Rice water.
Damp cloth.
Smoke that had travelled south on skin.

In the afternoon, a merchant arrived with ox carts laden with sacks.

He was thick-necked, well fed, dressed in good cloth that had travelled through many hands. A gold chain lay against his chest. His servants moved with the alertness of men who had been beaten before and wanted to avoid it happening again.

He greeted Kesavadas like an equal, which told me more than his jewellery.

Then he looked at me and smiled.

"Balan Pillai," he said, using the name Travancore had given me, the name that tried to cover what my face could not. "You look like a man who knows what a starving crowd can do."

"I know," I replied.

He nodded, satisfied.

"Thomman Mappila," he introduced himself. "Pepper. Cardamom. Credit. These are my weapons. Yours are sharper, but mine pay for yours."

His Malayalam was smooth and coastal. He slipped Portuguese words into it without noticing, like a man who had learned to speak to factories as easily as he spoke to temples.

He gestured toward the sacks.

"Rice," he said. "And dried fish. Not charity. Investment. If these people die, the north becomes empty, and empty land becomes Mysore land."

I stared at him.

He did not blink.

This was the first time I understood something my father had known and I had ignored. War is paid for long before it is fought.

Thomman leaned closer.

"One more thing," he said. "Among the refugees are women who can read and men who can count. Use them. Do not waste useful hands."

He glanced at my forehead, only briefly.

Then he added, almost casually, "And do not let them hang you in their minds for what is written there. They have enough ghosts already."

He walked away to speak with Kesavadas.

I watched him and felt something like resentment.

Some men carry their sins on paper.
Some carry them on skin.

---

That evening, after the sun went down and the campfires came up, I walked the edge of the camp with Kesava.

He watched the refugees with the discomfort of a man seeing the kingdom's future as a problem he cannot stab.

"This is how Tipu fights," he muttered. "He does not only attack walls. He attacks the stomach."

A woman began to sing softly near one of the fires.

It was not a lullaby.

It sounded like prayer.

The words were not Malayalam.

They were older, shaped by churches and ships and a coast that had been trading with the world before the Marathas learned to ride south.

I stopped without meaning to.

The voice was low and steady, as if the singer had decided that if she could not control anything else, she could at least control sound.

Kesava followed my gaze.

In the firelight I saw a woman kneeling beside a child, her hands moving over the child's ribs, checking for breath. Her hair was braided tight. Her face was thinner than it should have been, but her eyes were sharp.

She looked up and met my stare without flinching.

Most people look at the brand and then look away.

This woman looked at it as if it was simply another fact, like weather or hunger, and then looked at my eyes as if that was the part that mattered.

Kesava nudged my arm, irritated.

"Do not stare," he whispered.

I did not answer.

The woman's gaze held mine for a heartbeat longer, then she looked back down at the child and continued her work.

In the dark, with smoke in my nose and the sound of prayer in my ears, I felt a strange certainty.

The north had finally reached us.

And it had brought a face I would not be able to forget.
