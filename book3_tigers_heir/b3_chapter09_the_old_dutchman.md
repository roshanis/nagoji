# Chapter 9: The Old Dutchman

The first time I went to Udayagiri, I thought I was walking into a story.

In the Deccan, fort stories are always the same. High walls. Cannon. Men shouting and dying on stone steps. Names carved into memory.

In Travancore, Udayagiri felt different.

Not because the walls were higher.

Because the place smelled of discipline.

Discipline has a smell if you have learned to notice it.

It smells like oiled rope and clean iron. It smells like powder stored dry. It smells like men who are paid on time and punished quickly.

It smells like a fort that expects to be tested.

---

Revathi sent me on the errand because she wanted to see whether I would run.

She did not say that.

She said the fort needed horses. She said a message had to be carried. She said a stable hand who could ride without falling off was useful.

Her eyes said something else.

If you run, you die.
If you return, you might become something.

I rode north with a small escort, the road muddy, the air thick. The brand on my forehead drew stares in villages, but in Travancore the stares were different.

In the Deccan, men looked at the brand and saw a crime.

Here, men looked at it and saw an outsider.

Travancore had many outsiders.

Some became soldiers.
Some became corpses.

The fort rose out of green like a stone ship.

Its walls were not the dry brown stone of my childhood. They were laterite and mortar, darkened by rain, with moss clinging to the shaded places. Cannon mouths stared out from embrasures like open jaws.

As we approached, a gun fired on the range.

The sound punched the air.

The recoil echoed off the walls.

My horse flinched and then steadied.

So did I.

I had heard cannon before, from a distance, as background to other men's wars.

Here the cannon sounded like a promise.

Travancore was not a soft kingdom.

---

The gate captain looked at my escort, then looked at me.

His gaze stayed on my forehead longer than was polite.

"Revathi's man," one of the escort said.

The captain nodded.

"Inside," he said.

The gate swallowed us.

Inside, the yard was busy.

Gunners moved around cannon with practised speed, swabbing barrels, checking vents. Powder boys carried charges under cloth, their faces serious. A European-looking man shouted orders in Malayalam that sounded clipped and strange.

Men obeyed him anyway.

That was the first shock.

In the Deccan, foreigners are curiosities.

Here, foreigners gave orders.

The captain led us toward a shaded shed where maps hung on the wall and the smell of chalk mixed with powder.

A tall pale man stood under the eave, his hair grey, his posture still military.

He wore local cloth and a light breastplate.

His face was European.

His eyes were not soft.

He looked at me as if he could see through cloth and skin to the thing beneath.

The captain bowed slightly.

"De Lannoy," he said, using the name as if it were a title.

So this was the old Dutchman.

I had heard the name whispered in markets and stables. The foreign captain who built Travancore's guns. The man who had been enemy once and was now buried in the king's soil, if the stories were true.

He was not Dutch, not really, not in the way my father used the word.

But in Travancore, all Europeans blur into one category.

*Parangi*.

De Lannoy's gaze moved to my forehead.

He spoke to the captain in Malayalam, quick.

The captain answered.

Then De Lannoy looked at me again and spoke in a harsh Portuguese.

"Name," he said.

The Portuguese word struck my ears and slid off. My head was full of Malayalam and cannon and the sick knowledge of my own face.

Then a younger man stepped out of the shed and spoke in Marathi, accent strange but clear.

"He asks your name," the man said.

The younger man was European too, but different from De Lannoy. Darker hair. A face that looked as if it had learned to hide itself. His eyes were the eyes of a man who had spent years staring at iron.

"Bhalerao," I replied.

The younger man translated into Portuguese.

De Lannoy listened, expression unchanged.

He spoke again.

The younger man turned to me.

"He asks about the mark," he said.

I swallowed.

There was no hiding here.

"I killed a priest," I said.

The younger man's eyes flicked to my face, quick.

He translated.

De Lannoy's mouth tightened slightly.

It might have been contempt.

It might have been interest.

He spoke again.

The younger man hesitated, then translated.

"He says," the man began, "that Travancore does not need temple robbers. It needs soldiers."

My throat tightened.

I forced myself to speak before pride could stop me.

"I was a cavalryman's son," I said. "I can ride."

The younger man translated.

De Lannoy's gaze dropped to my hands, to the calluses, to the way I stood near my horse without fear.

He stepped closer.

He did not smell like sweat or spice.

He smelled like leather and old smoke.

He lifted one finger and pointed to my horse.

He spoke.

The younger man translated.

"He says to mount," he said.

My fingers tightened on the reins.

The yard's eyes were on me now.

Gunners paused.
Soldiers glanced.

Revathi had sent a branded stable hand into the fort, and now the foreign captain was making a game of him.

I mounted anyway.

The horse shifted under me, sensing my tension.

De Lannoy walked to the centre of the yard and pointed at a wooden post set in the ground, a target for mounted training.

He spoke again.

The younger man translated.

"Ride to it," he said. "Circle. Come back at speed. Stop clean."

It was not a heroic test.

It was the kind of test soldiers use to separate men who can sit a horse from men who belong to the horse.

I nudged my mount forward.

The yard blurred.

For a moment I forgot the brand.

For a moment I forgot the temple.

There was only the horse and the rhythm of movement and the old muscle memory my father had beaten into me with shouted commands and hard hands.

I rode to the post, circled tight, came back fast, then hauled the horse to a stop without making it rear.

The horse's hooves dug into wet earth.

It snorted once, angry.

Then it stood.

I dismounted and waited.

De Lannoy stared at me.

Then he said something to the younger man in a lower voice.

The younger man translated slowly, as if weighing the words.

"He says you were built for this," he told me. "And you chose opium instead."

The sentence struck harder than any insult.

It was too accurate.

I swallowed.

"Tell him," I said, voice rough, "that I know."

The younger man translated.

De Lannoy watched me for a long moment.

Then he spoke again, quieter, and this time the younger man's eyes shifted, surprised.

"He says," the younger man translated, "that he was the enemy once."

De Lannoy's gaze moved to the wall, to the guns, to the rain-dark stone.

"He says he will die in this soil," the younger man continued. "He says Travancore takes what it needs."

De Lannoy looked back at me.

His eyes held mine, hard.

The younger man finished.

"He says," he translated, "if you stay, the kingdom will take what it needs from you too."

I felt a chill despite the heat.

Taken.

Used.

Remade.

Those were not comforting words.

They were honest words.

De Lannoy turned away, conversation finished.

He spoke to the captain, pointed toward the stables, and the captain nodded.

The younger man remained a moment longer.

"I am Pieter," he said in Marathi, voice quiet.

I stared.

His name was European.

Yet his Marathi was better than mine would ever be.

"You live here," I said.

Pieter's mouth twitched.

"I survive here," he replied.

He glanced at my forehead and then looked away, as if politeness could soften reality.

"Do not think the fort is kinder than the road," he said quietly. "It only kills differently."

Then he turned and followed De Lannoy into the shed.

I stood in the gun yard with mud on my boots and a brand on my face and the sound of cannon still in my ears.

Revathi's message was clear now.

Travancore was not a refuge.

It was a forge.

If I stayed long enough, it would burn away whatever was left of the boy I had been.

And it would keep whatever could be used.
