# Chapter 28: The Fourth War

Tipu did not learn caution from defeat.

He learned anger.

By 1799, the anger had become a kind of hunger in the British. They spoke of Tipu the way priests speak of demons, as if killing him would cleanse the world.

It was never about cleansing.

It was about finishing.

---

The news arrived in Travancore with the first dry winds of the year.

Tipu had sent letters to the French.
Tipu had raised new troops.
Tipu had fortified his island fortress and filled it with guns.

The Company decided the tiger had to die before the French could feed him again.

General Harris would march.

Travancore was asked to contribute forces.

Asked is a polite word.

The request came with an expectation and an implied threat. Kingdoms that do not help the Company are treated like enemies. Sometimes politely, sometimes not.

Kesavadas called the council.

Priests argued about omens.
Nobles argued about money.
Captains argued about honour.

I sat at the edge of the room and watched men who had never heard a rocket scream decide whether they could afford another war.

When Kesavadas asked me, in private, whether I would go, I did not pretend to hesitate.

"Yes," I said.

Kesavadas studied me.

"Why?" he asked.

The burned church in Mariam's stories came back to me. Caspar's body. The king bleeding into a boat at Alleppey.

"Because I want to see it end," I replied.

Kesavadas nodded.

"Then go," he said. "And remember this. We are not marching as conquerors. We are marching as men paying for our own survival."

I went home and told Mariam.

She did not cry.

She had cried too much on the road north and learned that tears do not stop wars.

She looked at me for a long time, then said quietly, "Bring yourself back."

I nodded.

She reached up and touched my brand with two fingers, gentle, as if touching a scar could steady fate.

"If you die," she said, voice flat, "they will make stories about you. They will make you clean in the stories. I will not allow that."

I almost laughed.

Instead I leaned my forehead into her palm for a heartbeat, like a man seeking blessing from the only priest he trusted.

---

We marched north with a small Travancore contingent.

Cavalry for scouting.
Infantry for duty.
A few gunners trained by Hendrik, because Travancore's pride was always its guns.

Kesava rode with me.

He told his family he was going to serve the king.

He did not tell them he was going to chase a tiger into its den.

Major Doyle met us at the Company camp outside Coimbatore.

He was Irish, which meant the English treated him like a cousin they tolerated and distrusted.

He spoke Portuguese and Malayalam badly but with effort, which made him less unbearable than most.

When he learned Mariam was Syrian Catholic, his eyes softened slightly.

"My mother's people kept the faith under Protestant landlords," he told me quietly. "Different land, same lesson."

He said it without romance.

Doyle was a man who had learned that empires crush not only enemies.

He served the Company anyway, because serving is what soldiers do when there are no clean choices.

Captain Blackwood was there too, now more polished, more confident, wearing rank like a second skin.

He greeted me with a smile that suggested we were old friends.

"Balan Pillai," he said, pronouncing the name wrong. "Good to see Travancore still sends its best."

I did not answer.

Blackwood did not mind silence. He filled it with his own voice.

"This time," he said, "we will not leave the tiger with claws."

He walked away before I could respond, leaving the scent of cologne behind like an insult.

---

The march to Seringapatam was long, dry, and full of men.

British infantry in red.
Sepoys in Company colours.
Artillery trains stretching like a moving town.
Bullocks lowing, carts creaking, dust rising.

Indian allies rode and walked alongside.

I saw Hyderabad men with curved swords and quiet eyes.
I saw Company irregulars who looked like bandits with uniforms.
I saw Maratha horsemen who moved with the familiar arrogance of riders who believe the world belongs to speed.

It was among them that I saw the Deshmukh.

Not at first as a face.

As a posture.

Some men carry authority the way others carry weapons.

He rode at the head of a small Maratha contingent, hair grey now, moustache thick, jaw set. His men looked older too, men who had survived by becoming hard.

The Deshmukh's eyes moved across the camp, assessing, and then, like a knife finding flesh, they found me.

For a moment the noise of the army fell away.

I saw Sangamner again.
Temple stones wet with blood.
My father's hand pushing me into the dark.

The Deshmukh stared at my forehead.

He did not need to read the letters.

He had been reading them in his mind for forty years.

His horse shifted.

His men noticed his stillness and looked where he looked.

One of them whispered.

I could not hear the words, but I knew the shape of them.

Priest-killer.
Son-killer.
The man who escaped.

Kesava leaned close.

"Do not start this now," he muttered. "Not here."

I kept my gaze on the Deshmukh.

He did not ride toward me.

Not yet.

He turned his horse and moved on, as if saving the confrontation for a place that would hurt more.

I felt my stomach twist.

Some hunts do not end when the hunted becomes a soldier.

They end when the hunter grows tired.

Or when both men stand in the same ruin and admit what cannot be changed.

---

When we finally reached the Kaveri, Seringapatam rose from the water like a promise made of stone.

The island fortress sat tight within the river, walls thick, bastions strong, guns visible in embrasures. The river curled around it like a moat of living movement.

Tipu's flags flew over the battlements.

I saw the tiger symbol again and felt my hand tighten as if remembering the green silk I had taken in Travancore.

This was the source.

This was where the beast had made itself a king.

British engineers began their work immediately.

Trenches.
Batteries.
Guns placed with mathematical patience.

The siege settled into rhythm.

Gun fire.
Shovels.
Sweat.
Night watch.

Tipu answered with cannon and sorties.

Rockets screamed across the river at night, arcing like angry comets, bursting into sparks among the tents.

Men cursed.
Horses screamed.
A tent caught fire and was stamped out with boots.

Major Doyle walked the lines with me one evening, watching the fort.

"He will die," Doyle said quietly.

It was not a boast.

It was a soldier's assessment.

"Yes," I replied.

Doyle glanced at me.

"And what will you be when he is dead?" he asked.

The question made my throat tighten.

I looked back at the fort, the stone beast in the river.

"Still marked," I said.

Doyle nodded, understanding more than most.

"Then keep walking," he said. "Men like us cannot afford to stop."
