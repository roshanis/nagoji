# Chapter 29: The Breach

The last days of the siege were a kind of waiting that eats men alive.

You wake to gun fire.
You eat while cannon balls pass overhead.
You sleep in fragments, listening for the scream of a rocket that might decide your tent is next.

Everything becomes routine.

That is how war tricks you.

It turns horror into habit.

---

The breach was opened by mathematics.

British gunners did not fire with the rage of men seeking revenge. They fired with method. Battery guns, shot after shot, same angle, same target, same patient violence.

Stone shuddered.
Dust rose.
Chunks fell.

Each day the wall looked a little less like an answer and a little more like a question.

Tipu's gunners answered from the bastions, and the river between us became a place where iron and water argued without end.

On the morning of May 4, 1799, the air felt wrong.

Too still.

Even the birds seemed to have left the trees along the riverbank.

Major Doyle came to our contingent before noon.

"Assault today," he said, voice clipped. "Be ready."

Kesava swore softly under his breath.

I checked my knife, then checked the talwar I had been given by Ananthan years before, a blade forged in the Deccan but used now in Travancore service. The steel was clean, oiled, sharp.

Clean steel is a lie. It is only waiting.

At midday, the order came.

British officers moved along the line, shouting.
Drummers began.
Men tightened straps and checked flints.

The storming party formed up by the river.

General Baird led the main column, his face hard, his eyes fixed on the breach as if the wall had personally insulted him.

I saw Colonel Wellesley briefly, a younger man on horseback, narrow-faced, watching everything with a gaze that looked older than his years. He did not shout. He did not smile. He simply observed, as if already writing the future in his head.

Then the world narrowed to the breach.

---

We went in across the river, wading where the water was shallow enough and scrambling over rocks where it was not.

Boots filled with water.
Cloth clung to skin.
Men cursed as powder horns threatened to get wet.

The first shot from the fort cracked over our heads.

Then another.

Then rockets.

The scream of them hit the spine like cold fingers.

One burst among the sepoys beside us, spraying sparks and iron splinters. A man fell, hands at his face, blood running through his fingers. Another man tripped over him and went down into the water, flailing.

The column kept moving.

That was the assault's cruelty.

You do not stop for the wounded. You step over them and hope someone behind you can drag them out.

The breach loomed, a jagged gap in the wall where stone had been chewed away.

Smoke poured from it.

Not only gun smoke.

Dust smoke.

The breath of crushed fortification.

We hit the breach in a rush.

Men climbed.
Men slipped.
Men shoved each other, not out of malice, but because a narrow gap does not care about politeness.

I grabbed a stone edge with my left hand, hauled myself up, and felt the roughness tear at my palm.

At the top, a Mysorean soldier lunged at me with a bayonet fixed to his musket.

I knocked the musket aside with my forearm and drove my knife into his throat.

His eyes widened.

He tried to speak.

Only blood came.

He fell backward into the smoke and vanished.

I did not follow with my eyes.

Following the dead is how you join them.

Kesava was beside me, talwar moving, cutting through the tight space like a man carving his name into stone.

British soldiers pushed in behind, bayonets out, faces red with effort.

Sepoys surged too, their discipline holding under fire, their eyes fierce.

Inside the fort, the air was thicker.

Smoke hung low.
The heat was sudden, trapped between walls.
The noise became close, no longer distant cannon thunder but human shouting, flesh-level.

Tipu's men fought hard.

They did not run.

They knew what surrender meant in this war.

The fighting turned into pockets.

A corner.
A courtyard.
A gate.

Each one a small battle.

I lost sense of time.

A minute could be a lifetime.

At one point, a Mysorean soldier grabbed my uniform and tried to pull me down. His face was smeared with soot, his eyes wild.

He shouted something in Kannada I did not understand.

His breath smelled of betel and fear.

I headbutted him.

The impact rang in my skull.

He staggered.

Kesava cut him down without looking, as if the blade had eyes of its own.

We pushed deeper.

Rockets fired from within the fort now, short range, brutal. One slammed into a wall and burst, filling a narrow lane with smoke and sparks. Men screamed and fell, clothes burning. A British officer shouted for water, as if water could solve an explosion.

In the chaos, I saw something that made my stomach turn.

A British soldier, face twisted with rage, bayoneted a wounded Mysorean who was trying to crawl away.

The Mysorean made a sound that was more animal than human.

The British soldier yanked the bayonet free and laughed.

Not victory laughter.

The laughter of a man discovering what he is capable of.

I wanted to hit him.

There was no time.

War gives you a list of things you want to do and then burns the list.

---

By late afternoon, the fort's resistance began to break in places.

We reached a larger courtyard near the inner gates, bodies scattered, smoke curling along the ground.

An officer shouted, "Tipu is dead."

The words travelled fast, faster than musket balls.

Men cheered.
Men roared.
Men surged forward with new violence, as if the tiger's death had loosened something in the human throat.

I did not cheer.

I did not trust it.

Then I saw the body.

Not at first as Tipu.

As a man in a fine coat, blood-dark, being carried by sepoys through the smoke.

His face was partly visible, moustache stiff, eyes half open, as if still refusing to accept the end.

Men crowded around, shouting in different languages.

Some spat.
Some tried to touch the body as if proof required fingers.

A British officer shouted orders to clear space.

General Baird rode past, face set.

Someone held up a sword, claiming it as Tipu's.

Someone else held up a piece of cloth, claiming it as his flag.

Greed began immediately.

Victory is a market.

As the sun lowered, the sack began.

Not officially, not announced.

It began as men stepping into houses, grabbing what they saw.
It became men dragging women by the arm.
It became men killing servants who tried to protect their master's property.

British and sepoy alike.

Empire makes everyone hungry.

I walked through a lane where a Mysorean child stood crying beside a dead woman.

The child's face was streaked with soot and tears.

He looked at my brand and did not know what it meant.

He only knew I was another soldier.

I kept walking.

That is the truth that shames me most.

Not what I did with a knife as a young addict.

What I failed to do with a sword as a seasoned man.

I found Kesava near a gate, his face smeared with blood, his eyes bright and empty.

"It is done," he said, voice hoarse.

"Yes," I replied.

We stood together and watched the fort burn from within, smoke rising into a sky that did not care.

Tipu was dead.

And the men who killed him were already becoming something else.
