# Chapter 10: Earning the Saddle

Revathi did not promote men with kindness.

She promoted them with danger.

If you survived what she threw at you, you were useful.
If you failed, you were disposable.

I had been in her stables for months by the time the chance came.

My hands had learned the rhythm of Travancore horses. My back had learned the weight of work that never ends. My tongue had learned enough Malayalam to understand insults without translation.

The opium craving had faded into a dull ache, like an old injury that flares in weather.

The brand on my forehead remained.

Some scars fade.

Some are meant to be read.

Kesava still treated me like dirt.

He did not spit.

He did not need to.

He looked through me as if I were a stain on the courtyard floor.

That hurt more than spitting would have.

Then bandits came and made all of us honest.

---

They struck at dusk, when the light turns soft and men begin to believe the day is done.

Revathi's estate kept pepper in a storehouse near the backwater, sacks piled high, guarded because pepper is as valuable as silver when war is near. The guards there were not the king's men. They were Revathi's men. Loyal to her because she fed them and punished them and paid them on time.

Bandits knew that.

Bandits always know where the money sleeps.

The first warning was a shout from the direction of the storehouse.

Then a bell rang, hard and fast.

Stable boys froze with buckets in their hands.

Horses lifted their heads, ears pricked.

Kannan swore and spat into the mud.

"Dogs," he muttered.

Kesava's voice cut through the courtyard.

"To me," he shouted.

Men ran toward the armour rack and spear stand.

I stood for a heartbeat with my hands full of tack and my mind empty.

Then instinct filled the emptiness.

This was what I knew.

Not stable work.

Violence.

I dropped the tack and moved.

Kannan grabbed my arm.

"Stable," he hissed. "Stay."

His grip was hard, warning.

If I ran into a fight and killed again, Revathi's gambit would end with a rope.

I looked at Kannan's hand on my arm.

"If I stay," I said, voice low, "I remain what they think I am."

Kannan's eyes narrowed.

He understood.

He released my arm with a curse.

"Do not disgrace us," he muttered.

I ran to the horse line.

Not to steal.

To borrow, as if the difference mattered.

I grabbed a small grey mare that I had been working with for weeks, the biting one. She snapped at the air as I threw the reins over her neck.

I spoke to her fast, nonsense sounds, the way my father had.

The mare snorted, then stood.

I swung onto her back without saddle.

Someone shouted my name.

Someone shouted priest-killer.

I kicked the mare forward and rode toward the storehouse.

---

The storehouse yard was chaos.

Three bandits had already cut two guards down, their bodies in the mud, blood mixing with rainwater from the last shower. The bandits moved fast, swords flashing, their cloth dark.

More men were coming behind them, dragging sacks toward the water where a small boat waited, hidden in reeds.

They were not desperate thieves.

They were organised.

Kesava had arrived with six guards and a sword in his hand, his face hard with anger. He fought well. I hated him, and I could not deny his skill.

He drove one bandit back with a quick cut to the forearm.

Then another bandit rushed him from the side, spear low.

Kesava turned too late.

The spear point was aimed at his ribs.

My body moved before thought.

I kicked the mare into a short burst of speed and threw myself sideways off her back.

My shoulder hit the bandit like a stone.

We went down together into the mud.

The spear skittered away.

The bandit rolled, trying to bring his sword up.

I had no sword.

I grabbed a broken spear shaft from the ground and drove the splintered end into his face.

He screamed and clawed at his eyes.

I hit him again, hard, until he stopped moving.

Kesava stared at me, breathing hard, sword still raised.

For a heartbeat, his gaze went to my forehead.

I saw the calculation.

Is this man saving me, or hunting me?

Then another bandit shouted and charged.

The moment ended.

Kesava turned and met the charge.

I scrambled up, mud on my hands, heart hammering, and grabbed the spear the bandit had dropped.

The spear felt strange.

It was not a Maratha weapon. It was not a knife.

But it was wood and iron, and it could kill.

I stepped into the fight.

The next minutes became a blur of wet ground, shouting, steel ringing, bodies slipping.

One bandit tried to drag a pepper sack toward the reeds.

I jabbed the spear into his thigh.

He screamed and dropped the sack, hands clawing at the wound.

Another bandit swung at me with a curved blade.

I parried with the spear shaft and felt the impact vibrate up my arms.

The bandit laughed, thinking a stable hand could not fight.

I drove the spear point into his belly.

The laugh cut off.

He folded to his knees, eyes wide, and fell forward into mud.

Behind him, a guard from Revathi's house drove his sword down and finished the man without hesitation.

Bandits are not romantic.

They are problems.

Kesava shouted an order.

"Do not let them reach the boat."

Two guards surged toward the reeds.

The bandits saw the boat escape route closing and began to break.

One threw a knife at Kesava.

The blade struck Kesava's upper arm and stuck there.

Kesava hissed, pain flashing, but he did not drop his sword.

He cut the attacker down with a vicious slash to the neck.

Blood sprayed.

The remaining bandits ran.

Men chased.

The boat in the reeds shoved away, oars digging, trying to escape with two sacks.

I ran into the water up to my knees and hurled the spear like a javelin.

The spear struck the boat's side with a crack and punched through thin wood.

The boat lurched.

One oar snapped.

The men in the boat shouted, scrambling.

A guard beside me fired a matchlock.

The ball hit the water.

The boat kept moving, slower now, dragging.

Kesava's voice shouted again.

"Let them go," he ordered. "We have held the store."

Men stopped chasing reluctantly.

War teaches you that you cannot catch everything.

You catch what matters.

---

After, the yard looked different.

Not because bodies lay in it. Bodies were always possible.

Because the yard had been tested and had not yielded.

The guards dragged the dead bandits into a line. They counted.

Five dead.
Two escaped in the damaged boat.

Two of Revathi's guards were dead.

Kesava's arm bled through his cloth.

He looked at me then, properly, not through me.

His gaze moved from my mud-smeared hands to the spear in my grip to the brand on my forehead.

"You fought," he said.

It was not praise.

It was surprise.

"Yes," I replied.

Kesava's mouth tightened.

"You saved me," he said.

The sentence sounded like a confession he hated making.

"If you died," I said, and my voice was rough, "Revathi would have blamed me."

Kesava stared for a moment.

Then, to my surprise, he laughed once, sharp.

"You have learned Travancore quickly," he said.

He looked at the bandit bodies lined in mud.

"You kill easily," he added.

The words were not admiration.

They were warning.

I did not deny it.

"I have had practice," I said.

Kesava's gaze flicked to my brand.

Then he turned away, as if unwilling to look at the proof.

---

Revathi arrived when the bodies had been dragged and the pepper sacks counted.

She came with two women holding umbrellas over her head and a guard at her side. Her cloth was dry. Her feet did not touch mud.

Power has its own weather.

She took in the scene with one glance.

The dead guards.
The dead bandits.
The damaged boat trail in the reeds.
Kesava's bleeding arm.

Then her gaze fixed on me.

I stood with the spear still in my hand, mud on my clothes, blood on my fingers.

Revathi's eyes narrowed.

"So," she said in Marathi, voice calm, "the dog has teeth."

Kesava stiffened at the word dog.

Revathi ignored him.

She walked toward me and stopped close enough that I could smell perfume under the rain damp.

Her gaze went to the brand.

Then to my hands.

"You did not run," she said.

It was not a question.

"No," I replied.

Revathi nodded.

"Good," she said. "Running is for men who still believe they can escape themselves."

She turned to Kannan, who had followed at a distance, face guarded.

"Move him from the stables," she ordered. "He will sleep with the household guard now."

My breath caught.

Not relief.

Fear.

A stable is humiliating, but it is safe. It keeps you low. A guard post puts a weapon in your hand and eyes on you.

Revathi looked at me.

"Do not mistake this for forgiveness," she said.

Her voice stayed cool.

"A horse is still a horse even if it pulls a chariot," she continued. "You are still what you are."

She gestured toward the dead bandits.

"But you can be used," she finished.

Used.

There was that word again, the word Travancore loved.

Revathi turned away as if the decision was nothing.

Kesava watched her go, then looked at me again.

His eyes were unreadable now.

Not contempt.

Not acceptance.

Something in between.

"If you betray this house," he said quietly, "I will kill you myself."

I nodded.

"If I betray this house," I replied, "I deserve it."

Kesava stared at me for a heartbeat, then shook his head as if annoyed by the answer.

"Come," he said. "We clean. Then we report."

We walked back toward the courtyard together, two men who should have been enemies, bound by a fight in the mud.

I carried the spear like a tool.

For the first time since the temple, I felt the knife in my mind become lighter.

Not because the guilt was gone.

Because I had used my hands for something other than theft.

It was a small difference.

In Travancore, small differences become survival.
