# Chapter 7: Revathi's Gambit

The rain did not stop.

It fell in thick sheets, turning the road outside Ananthan Pillai's gate into a shallow river. Mud swallowed my feet. Water ran into the brand on my forehead and made the scar tissue sting as if the iron had just been pressed there.

The gate stayed closed.

Inside the wall, I could hear life.

Horses stamping.
Men shouting in drill.
A cart wheel creaking.

Work.

Travancore's heartbeat.

Outside, I was a soaked animal with a mark on his face, waiting for a mercy I did not deserve.

I had told myself I was not waiting for mercy.

I was waiting because I had nowhere else to go.

There is no dignity in that.

After an hour, my knees began to shake, not from fear, from exhaustion. Withdrawal had left me hollow. The road had scraped the rest of me raw. Even standing felt like effort.

I slid down against the wall and sat in the mud.

The rain plastered my hair to my forehead.

The brand was fully exposed now.

Let the world see, I thought bitterly. Let it stare until it gets bored.

Then a sound came from the gate.

Not the heavy bar shifting.

Lighter.

Footsteps.

The small click of a latch.

The door in the main gate opened a crack.

An umbrella appeared.

Then a woman's voice spoke from the gap, calm and amused.

"You look like a drowned dog," she said in Marathi.

My head snapped up.

The umbrella tilted, and I saw her face.

She was older than my mother had been when she died, but there was nothing frail in her. Her hair was tied back, streaked with grey, her eyes sharp. She wore cloth draped with the ease of a woman who has never had to apologise for taking up space.

Her gaze moved over me, taking in the brand, the mud, the hollow cheeks, the trembling hands.

She did not flinch.

That was what frightened me most.

"Who are you?" I asked, voice hoarse.

The woman smiled.

"Revathi," she said. "And you are the boy who thinks rain can wash sin."

The sentence hit hard.

I tried to speak.

Revathi lifted her hand slightly, and the attempt died in my throat.

"You have Dhanaji's face," she said, and for a moment something softened in her eyes. Not pity. Memory. "Not the best part of it. But enough."

My chest tightened.

"You knew my father?" I asked.

Revathi's smile returned, thinner now.

"Everyone knew Dhanaji," she said. "He had the annoying habit of doing his duty well."

She looked at the brand again.

"And you," she continued, voice cool, "have the habit of doing the opposite."

I wanted to deny it.

Denial is a luxury I had burned away.

Revathi stepped closer, umbrella covering both of us for a moment. The rain hammered the cloth above my head.

"Why are you here?" she asked.

I swallowed.

"My father wrote a letter," I said. "To Ananthan Pillai."

Revathi nodded as if she already knew.

"He did," she said. "And my husband read it."

Husband.

The word landed with weight.

Revathi was not a servant.

She was not a passing visitor.

She belonged here in a way I never would.

"He told you to go away," I said.

Revathi's eyes glittered with amusement.

"He did," she agreed. "He enjoys telling people to go away. It makes him feel young."

She reached out and, without warning, touched the edge of the brand with one fingertip.

Pain flared.

I jerked back, half anger, half instinct.

Revathi did not move.

"So," she said, "it is real."

Her finger dropped.

"They did not even burn it neatly," she added. "If you are going to disgrace a man, at least do it with craftsmanship."

A laugh bubbled up in me, surprised and ugly.

Revathi watched it and nodded as if she had expected it.

"Good," she said. "You can still laugh. That means you are not dead yet."

She stepped back.

"Get up," she ordered. "And come inside."

My throat tightened.

"He said-"

"He said many things," Revathi interrupted. "He is not the only voice in this house."

The door opened wider.

A guard reached out and grabbed my arm.

Not gently.

He hauled me to my feet.

Revathi turned and walked into the courtyard without looking back, as if assuming I would follow.

My boots stuck for a moment in the mud. Then I stepped through the gate.

The wall shut out the rain's roar, and suddenly the courtyard noise was louder.

Horses.
Men drilling.
Servants moving fast with buckets.

Life.

Revathi led me toward the main hall.

I followed with mud on my feet and death on my forehead.

---

Ananthan waited inside.

He stood in the hall with the letter in his hand, his face carved into cold contempt. The knife I had stolen lay on a low table beside him, wrapped now, not displayed.

He looked at me, then at Revathi.

"What is this?" he asked in Marathi.

Revathi walked past him and sat on a low seat as if the hall belonged to her.

It did.

"This," she said, gesturing toward me with two fingers, "is Dhanaji's son."

Ananthan's mouth tightened.

"This is a criminal," he replied. "This is a priest-killer."

Revathi shrugged.

"Yes," she said. "Travancore is full of criminals if you look closely enough."

Ananthan's eyes flashed.

"Do not make jokes," he snapped.

Revathi's smile vanished.

"Do not pretend you are pure," she replied, voice sharp now. "You were a prisoner once. You were a stranger. You were a man the court wanted dead until the king decided your sword was useful."

Ananthan went very still.

The servants in the hall froze, ears straining.

Revathi leaned forward slightly.

"Dhanaji rode beside you," she continued. "He bled beside you. He became your brother in the only way soldiers become brothers."

Ananthan's jaw worked.

He lifted the letter slightly.

"And now his son comes with a brand and a stolen knife," he said. "He brings defilement to my door."

Revathi's eyes narrowed.

"Your door," she repeated. "Is it your door, Ananthan, or is it ours?"

The word ours hung between them.

Ananthan and Revathi had built a life out of arguments like this, arguments that sounded like hatred to outsiders and felt like intimacy to those inside.

Revathi stood.

She walked to the table and picked up the wrapped knife.

She held it out toward Ananthan.

"This belonged to you," she said. "And you gave it to Dhanaji."

Ananthan's eyes flicked to the knife.

Revathi continued.

"Dhanaji died saving his son," she said. "You can call the boy worthless. You can be right. But the father died anyway."

Her voice lowered.

"Do you want Dhanaji's death to mean nothing?" she asked.

Ananthan's face tightened.

For a heartbeat, I saw something like pain in it.

Then it vanished behind discipline.

"He is not staying," Ananthan said.

Revathi nodded as if she had expected that line.

"He is staying," she replied.

Ananthan took a step forward.

"Revathi," he warned.

Revathi met his gaze without flinching.

"You will not take him as a guest," she said. "You will not pretend he is clean. You will not let him sit in this hall and eat as if he has done nothing."

She turned and looked at me.

"You will work," she said. "You will start at the lowest rung. The stables. The dung. The horses. You will sleep where the horses sleep."

My throat tightened.

Humiliation.

That I understood.

Revathi looked back at Ananthan.

"If he runs," she said, "let him run. If he steals, let him be whipped. If he kills again, let him hang."

Her voice stayed calm.

"But he will not be turned away like a stray dog," she finished. "Not after his father died at a rope for him."

Ananthan stared at her.

Rain drummed on the roof.

Somewhere in the courtyard, a horse snorted.

Finally, Ananthan spoke.

"You are doing this to spite me," he said.

Revathi smiled again.

"Partly," she admitted.

Then she looked at me, and the smile sharpened.

"Mostly," she said, "because I want to see whether a man branded on his forehead can still become useful."

The word useful landed like a chain.

Ananthan's eyes narrowed.

He looked at me one last time.

"If you shame this house," he said quietly, "Revathi will not be able to save you."

I swallowed.

"I do not want saving," I said, and the words surprised me because they were true. "I want work."

Ananthan's mouth tightened.

Revathi's eyes gleamed.

"Good," she said. "Then we understand each other."

She turned and called for the stable master.

The trap had closed.

Not a prison.

Something worse.

A chance.
