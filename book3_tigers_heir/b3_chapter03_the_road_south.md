# Chapter 3: The Road South

I learned to lie on the road south.

Not the clumsy lies of a desperate man. Those I had already mastered. I learned the careful, patient lies of a survivor. The lies you tell with your body, your eyes, your voice.

The lies that become so familiar they start to feel like truth.

My name was Govind. I was a horse trader from Pune, traveling south to buy stock from Carnatic breeders. The scar on my forehead was from a stable fire when I was a boy. Tragic, yes, but tragedy makes men humble.

This was the man I invented to cover the brand that shouted my crime to the world.

I wore him like a second skin.

---

I found the caravan outside Aurangabad.

Aurangabad is a city built on ghosts. It had been a Mughal jewel once, full of marble and ambition. By the time I limped into its outskirts, it was a place of cracked walls and tired markets, ruled by the Nizam's men and haunted by the memory of emperors who had thought stone could make them immortal.

In Aurangabad, no one cared who you were as long as you paid.

That was its mercy.

I slept in a stable yard the first night, curled beside a horse that was not mine, the smell of manure and straw dulling the ache of withdrawal. In the dark, I took off the cloth around my head and touched the brand.

The scar tissue was raised, angry. The letters were rough under my fingers.

I did not need to read them.

My skin remembered.

I wrapped the cloth back around my head before dawn and went looking for work.

Work is the one thing a man like me can always find, if he accepts humiliation as a wage.

---

The caravan master was a Muslim from Bidar named Ismail Khan.

He sat on a bale of cloth outside the caravan yard gate, watching his men load camels with the calm authority of a man who knew that commerce is a kind of war fought with numbers instead of swords.

He looked up when I approached.

His eyes took in my posture, my horse, the way I held my hands.

He saw the things men think they can hide.

"You ride well," he said in Dakhni.

I nodded.

"I can handle horses," I replied.

He glanced at the cloth wrapped around my forehead.

"Stable fire?" he asked, tone bored.

The lie had already traveled ahead of me.

I forced a small smile.

"Yes," I said.

Ismail Khan shrugged as if scars were ordinary.

"We leave for Bijapur," he said. "Then south. Bandits on the road. Nizam's officials too. Both want money. If you are strong and you do not steal from me, you can ride with us."

I swallowed.

Steal from him.

The word tasted bitter.

"I will not steal," I said.

Ismail Khan's eyes held mine for a heartbeat.

Then he nodded.

"Then eat," he said. "You look like a man who has been sick."

Sick.

That was kinder than calling me what I was.

I ate rice from a leaf plate while the caravan yard woke around me.

The food sat heavy in my stomach at first, then settled.

For the first time since Sangamner, I felt something like steadiness.

---

We moved out at sunrise, camels swaying, carts creaking, guards walking with spears and matchlocks.

I rode near the rear with two other guards.

One was a thick man named Shankar with three missing fingers on his left hand and a laugh that sounded like gravel. He had fought for Marathas once, then for the Nizam, then for whoever paid.

"War makes men loyal to hunger," he told me on the first day.

The other was a boy named Rahim with a downy beard and eyes too old for his face. He carried a matchlock and tried to look fearless.

The Deccan rolled beneath us, dry and brown, scattered with thorn trees. Villages looked small from the road, their walls low, their wells guarded like treasure.

Everywhere we passed, people watched the caravan with the careful gaze of the poor.

Not envy.

Calculation.

Could we steal from them?
Could they steal from us?

The road teaches you that trust is a luxury.

On the second day, we passed a burned village.

Blackened roof beams stuck out of ash like broken ribs. A dog nosed at something in the debris and then trotted away, uninterested.

Shankar spat.

"Nizam's men," he said. "Or Marathas. Or Mysore. It does not matter. Everyone burns the same."

He glanced at my wrapped head.

"You are running from something," he said.

It was not a question.

My throat tightened.

"A debt," I lied.

Shankar laughed.

"Everyone runs from debt," he said. "Only fools pretend otherwise."

His laughter was not unkind.

It was the laughter of a man who had stopped pretending the world was fair.

---

The bandits came on the fourth day, in a rocky defile where the road narrowed and scrub rose high on both sides.

The passage squeezed the caravan into a single-file knot. Carts and camels bunched so close that the rear could hear the front breathe.

I saw them before the others did.

Not their bodies.

Their intent.

The defile was too quiet. Birds had gone silent. A cart wheel squeaked too loud. The camels snorted and shifted as if smelling danger.

I leaned forward and spoke to Shankar.

"Riders," I whispered.

He looked at me, then at the scrub, then nodded.

Ismail Khan was riding near the front. By the time the guards passed warning forward, the bandits had already moved.

They burst out of the scrub with swords and spears, shouting.

Some hit the lead cart. A spear took a driver in the chest. He fell backward off his seat and the cart lurched, wheel slipping in loose stones.

Others came for the rear, cutting off the easy escape.

Rahim raised his matchlock with shaking hands.

"Fire," Shankar barked.

Rahim fired too high. Smoke burst. The ball vanished into rock.

The bandits were on us.

One swung a curved blade at my horse's neck.

My body moved before thought.

I kicked my horse forward and cut down with the knife, the blade flashing.

It caught the bandit's forearm. Blood sprayed.

The man screamed and fell back.

Another bandit lunged at me with a spear, eyes wild.

I leaned aside and grabbed the spear shaft with my left hand, the wood slick with sweat. The spear point scraped my coat and tore cloth.

I yanked the shaft, pulled the man off balance, and drove the knife into his belly.

He made a sound that was not a shout.

His face went slack.

He folded to the ground.

The sight should have sickened me.

It did not.

That was what frightened me most.

My body remembered violence the way it remembered riding.

Opium had ruined me.

The knife had not.

Shankar was fighting beside me now, spear thrusting, his laugh gone.

Ismail Khan's guards surged back from the front, matchlocks firing low.

The bandits hesitated.

Bandits are brave until the prey bites.

They began to pull away.

Then one bandit, desperate, grabbed at my head cloth.

His fingers hooked the edge and yanked.

The cloth slipped.

Air hit the brand.

The bandit's eyes widened as he saw the scarred letters.

He froze.

"Brahmin-killer," he breathed.

The word cut through the noise.

Shankar heard it.

So did Rahim.

So did the bandits who were retreating.

For a heartbeat, everything paused.

This was the moment when a man decides whether gold matters more than blood.

The Deshmukh's bounty was large enough to buy villages.

I saw the calculation on Shankar's face.

Then Shankar spat into the mud.

"If I take you," he said, voice flat, "I must share with Ismail. I must share with guards. I must share with officials. And then I must sleep with one eye open because your people will come for revenge."

He looked at me.

"Not worth it," he said.

He swung his spear at a bandit who had lingered too long, and the bandit fled.

Rahim stared at my face, horror and fascination mixed.

I pulled the cloth back over the brand with shaking hands.

My breath came too fast.

Not from the fight.

From the knowledge that my face could betray me at any moment.

Ismail Khan rode up, eyes sharp.

He took in the dead bandit at my horse's feet, the blood on my knife, the cloth around my forehead.

He said nothing.

Then he spoke in a voice that carried.

"We move," he ordered. "Now. Before more come."

The caravan lurched forward again, wheels creaking, camels groaning.

As we rode out of the defile, Shankar leaned close.

"Do not thank me," he muttered. "A man does not do mercy for free."

"Then why?" I asked, voice tight.

Shankar's laugh returned, small and ugly.

"Because you fought," he said. "A man who will fight for strangers is worth more than gold."

The sentence landed in me like a stone.

Worth.

I had not felt worth in a long time.

That night, under a leaking canvas, with rain tapping the cloth like fingers, I opened my father's letter for the first time.

The wax seal cracked.

The paper smelled faintly of smoke, as if my father had written it near a fire.

His handwriting was careful, the script of a man who had learned to make words behave.

He wrote of a place called Travancore.

He wrote of Ananthan Pillai, who had once been Nagoji Sawant.

He wrote one sentence that I read again and again until my eyes blurred.

If you have fallen so far that you cannot see the sky, go south. Find him. Tell him I died for you. Tell him the knife is his.

I held the letter to my chest and lay awake listening to rain.

For the first time since Sangamner, I felt something other than hunger.

Not peace.

Direction.
