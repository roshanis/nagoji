# Chapter 23: Fire and Flight

When a wall falls, the land behind it learns what it is to be naked.

The Lines had been more than earth and stone. They had been an idea. Travancore behind a barrier, safe enough to argue about taxes and temple rituals as if the north was a rumour.

After the breach, the north became a hand on our throat.

---

We retreated in pieces at first.

Not a clean withdrawal.

Not ranks stepping back to a drum.

Men ran.
Men carried wounded.
Men abandoned guns because wheels sink in Kerala mud and fear makes everything heavier.

Hendrik kept firing until the last moment, covering the withdrawal with the stubbornness of a man who has run out of ways to protect his brother.

When we finally pulled back from the wall, the gun platform behind us was a churned mess of broken wood, spilled powder, and blood.

Caspar's body was still there.

Two gunners were trying to lift him. His limbs were awkward, heavy, as if the moment the rocket hit he had become only meat.

Hendrik stood over them, face grey, eyes wide.

He did not cry.

He did not shout.

He simply looked as if someone had cracked his spine.

I stepped toward him and stopped with my hand half-raised, then let it drop.

Hendrik looked at me.

"He ran toward the fire," he said, voice flat.

It was accusation and pride in the same breath.

"He always did," I replied.

Hendrik's mouth twitched.

"Yes," he said. "And now the fire finally took him."

He bent down, took Caspar's hand, and closed the fingers around a small wooden cross Caspar wore on a cord.

"Carry him," Hendrik ordered the gunners. His voice sharpened on the word, becoming command because grief had no other shape he could hold.

They lifted Caspar and stumbled away.

I watched them go and felt something hard settle in me.

Caspar had been brave, reckless, brilliant under pressure.

He had also been young enough to believe bravery might be enough.

The wall had taught us otherwise.

Tipu's men poured through the breach like water through a split jar.

They moved fast, disciplined, not stopping to loot at first. The looting came later, when they could afford to be cruel.

In the first villages south of the Lines, they took cattle.
They took rice.
They took young men to drag guns.

Then, when resistance flared, they burned.

I saw the first burned temple at midday, smoke still rising from the roof beams.

The stone idols had been smashed, not because smashing them had tactical value, but because smashing them was a message.

In the next village, a small Syrian church had been opened like a box and emptied. The wooden cross above the door lay broken in the mud. A bell had been cut down and stolen, because even metal can be turned into humiliation.

Mariam's people had fled into Travancore believing walls could protect faith.

Now faith lay in ash beside the road.

Kesava met me at a crossroads with his troop, mud up to his calves and anger in his eyes.

"Where is the king?" he demanded.

"Retreating south," I replied. "Kesavadas is with him."

Kesava spat.

"Tipu is pushing hard," he said. "He wants to reach the sea. He wants to prove he can."

We rode together, two troops of cavalry moving like a net thrown backward, trying to slow a flood.

At one bridge, Tipu's forward scouts had already arrived.

They were not a full force. Maybe thirty riders, light cavalry, confident because confidence travels fast with a victorious army.

Kesava and I did not give them time to become a rumour.

We charged.

The bridge was narrow, slick with rain.

Hooves slipped.
Men shouted.
Steel rang.

I drove my horse straight into the centre and used the knife the way my father had taught me to use a sword. Not pretty. Not elegant. Effective.

One Mysorean rider tried to turn his horse sideways to block us. I leaned low and cut at his thigh. He screamed and fell, and his horse bolted, eyes rolling white.

Kesava took a man off his saddle with a clean talwar cut, the kind of cut that makes people believe in legends.

The Mysoreans broke and fled back into the trees.

We did not chase far.

Chasing is how cavalry dies when the enemy is smarter than your anger.

We held the bridge long enough for a line of ox carts and refugees to cross south.

Then we burned it.

The fire took quickly, wood soaked in oil.

The flames rose, licking at rain, defiant.

Watching it, I felt a sick understanding.

We were burning our own land to save it.

That is what war does. It makes you choose which parts of yourself to destroy.

---

That night we camped in a coconut grove, the trees standing like silent sentries.

The air was thick.
The insects were loud again.

The frogs croaked, indifferent to kings.

Kesava sat by a small fire, cleaning his blade.

I sat beside him, wiping my knife.

The blade was stained dark.

Not only with Mysorean blood.

With the past.

"Where is Mariam?" Kesava asked suddenly.

The question surprised me.

He had not wanted her in my life.

Now he spoke her name like it was a piece of strategy.

"At the house," I replied. "With Father Thomas and Thomman. They are moving refugees south."

Kesava grunted.

"Good," he said. "If she dies because you kept her near the Lines, I will drag you to Revathi myself and let her decide what to do with you."

It was an insult.

It was also, in Kesava's language, concern.

I stared into the fire and thought of Mariam's words.

Build a wall that holds.

The wall had not held.

So now we would have to become the wall.

Somewhere in the north, the breach widened, and Tipu's army moved through it with the certainty of a man who believed God had given him the coast.

South of us, the backwaters waited, wide and slow and deceptive, like peace.

Between Tipu and the sea stood only exhausted soldiers and people who had already lost everything once.

We rode at dawn.
