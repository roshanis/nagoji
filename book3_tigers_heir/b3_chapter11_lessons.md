# Chapter 11: Lessons

The first time they put a spear in my hand again, my fingers tightened too fast.

Wood and iron. Familiar weight. The old instinct waking, eager. The same hands that had stolen coins from sleeping men now wanted to feel useful steel.

One of Revathi's guards watched the movement and smiled without humour.

"Careful," he said in Malayalam. "That thing bites."

I almost laughed.

So do I, I thought.

But I kept my mouth shut.

Mouths get men killed in Travancore. Swords are safer than words.

---

Moving from the stables to the household guard did not feel like rising.

It felt like being exposed.

In the stables, men looked at my brand and then looked away. A stable has its own shame, and it does not bother borrowing someone else's.

In the guard barracks, men looked at my brand and stared.

They made space around me as if the scar could bleed onto them. They spoke softer when I passed, then louder when my back turned.

"Priest-killer."
"Temple defiler."
"Revathi has a taste for filth."

They did not say it to my face. They did not need to. The letters were on my forehead. The words belonged to everyone.

Kesava Pillai stared at me openly.

Not because he feared me.

Because he wanted me to know my place.

In the yard, Revathi's captains drilled us in the Travancore style.

Footwork on wet ground.
Spears held low, not high.
Shield work, tight and practical.

I had learned to ride in Deccan dust, where hooves kick sand and a man can see an enemy coming from far. In Travancore, the ground was slick, the air thick, the sightlines short. A fight could emerge from jungle in one breath.

You had to be ready before you understood you were in danger.

The drill was meant to build that readiness into the bones.

My body obeyed faster than my pride wanted.

Pride is another addiction.

---

On the third day of guard duty, Ananthan summoned me.

He did not send a servant.

He sent Kesava.

Kesava walked into the barracks with two guards behind him, as if he expected me to leap at his throat.

He stopped in front of my mat and looked down.

"Grandfather wants you," he said.

The word grandfather twisted in me.

Ananthan was not my blood. He was not my elder by any right I had earned. Yet his name carried my father's debt, and debts are thicker than blood sometimes.

I rose and followed Kesava across the yard.

Men turned their heads as we passed.

Kesava did not walk beside me. He walked half a step ahead, marking distance.

We reached the small training space behind Ananthan's hall, sheltered by trees. The rain had eased, but the ground still held water. Puddles reflected the sky in fragments.

Ananthan stood there with a wooden practice sword in his hand.

He wore plain cloth and no armour.

His face was calm.

His eyes were not.

He looked at my forehead first.

Then he looked at my hands.

"Pick it up," he said in Marathi, and he tossed the practice sword toward me.

I caught it.

The wood was smooth, worn by years of hands.

"Stance," he said.

I took a stance I remembered from my youth, from my father's lessons.

Ananthan's mouth tightened.

"That is Deccan," he said. "This is Travancore."

He stepped forward and struck my wrist with his wooden blade.

The blow was not hard, but it was precise. It turned my sword angle slightly. It exposed my ribs.

"Again," he said.

I adjusted.

He struck again, same place, same correction.

After ten strikes, my wrist burned.

After twenty, my pride began to crack.

After thirty, something else replaced pride.

Attention.

Ananthan circled me like a man inspecting a horse.

"You are fast," he said. "Fast is nothing without control."

He stepped in suddenly, wooden blade flashing, and struck my forehead cloth, snapping it loose.

The cloth fell.

The brand was bare.

Kesava stiffened behind me.

Ananthan did not look away.

"That mark will make men want to kill you," he said.

I swallowed.

"Good," I said, and the word came out rough. "Let them."

Ananthan's eyes narrowed.

He stepped closer until I could smell rain on his skin.

"Do not confuse death with courage," he said quietly. "Death is easy. It is a door every man can find. Living is harder."

His wooden blade tapped my chest once.

"Your father chose living for you," he said. "You do not get to choose dying as gratitude."

The sentence hit like a punch.

My throat tightened. I could not speak. My mouth tasted of iron.

Ananthan stepped back.

"Again," he said, as if the conversation had been another kind of drill.

We fought with wood for an hour.

He did not tire.

Old men who have survived wars do not rely on muscle. They rely on timing.

When the hour ended, my arms shook. Sweat ran down my back. My fingers ached from gripping.

Ananthan's breath was steady.

He looked at me for a long moment, then spoke.

"You will train at dawn," he said. "Every day."

I nodded, too tired to react.

"You will not drink," he continued.

I almost laughed.

"I do not drink," I said.

Ananthan's eyes held mine.

"You will not smoke," he said.

The word smoke made my chest tighten.

Opium.

He saw the reaction.

His voice stayed flat.

"If you bring that poison into this house," he said, "I will hang you myself."

I believed him.

I nodded.

Ananthan turned away as if we were finished.

Then he paused.

"Kesava," he said, not looking back.

Kesava stepped forward quickly.

"Yes, Grandfather."

Ananthan's voice cut like a blade.

"Do not touch his mark again," he said.

Kesava froze.

Ananthan turned his head slightly.

"If you want to test him, test his discipline," he continued. "Not his temper. His temper is already known."

Kesava's jaw tightened.

"Yes, Grandfather," he said.

Ananthan walked away into the hall, conversation closed.

Kesava stared at me for a long moment.

"He is wasting time on you," he said.

I picked up the fallen cloth and tied it around my forehead again, fingers careful on the scar.

"He is teaching me to be useful," I replied.

Kesava snorted.

"A priest-killer cannot be useful," he said.

I met his gaze.

"Then why are you afraid I will become one?" I asked.

Kesava's eyes flashed.

He stepped close, too close.

"I am not afraid," he hissed.

He walked away without another word.

---

That night, when the barracks quieted, I lay on my mat and listened to men breathing.

Someone in the corner muttered in his sleep. Someone else snored.

The smell of oil lamps and damp cloth filled the air.

My muscles ached.

My wrists stung where Ananthan had struck them again and again.

Under the ache, the old craving stirred.

Not a scream now.

A whisper.

Just one pipe.
Just one breath.

I pressed my palm against the brand, feeling the raised letters under cloth.

The pain was small.

It was real.

It kept me anchored.

In the dark, I heard my father's voice again.

Not a command.

A memory of his hand on my cheek at the execution ground.

Run.

Do not look back.

I stared at the ceiling until the whisper of opium grew tired and retreated.

Ananthan had been right.

Living was harder.

That was the lesson.
