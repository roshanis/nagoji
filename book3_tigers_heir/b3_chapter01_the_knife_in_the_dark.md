# Chapter 1: The Knife in the Dark

I will tell you what I was, because you need to understand what I became.

I was twenty years old the night I killed the priest. Twenty years old and already a ruin, hollowed out by the black paste I smoked in the dens of Sangamner.

Opium.

The word sounds almost gentle. It is not gentle. It is a god that demands everything and gives nothing back but hunger for more.

My father was Dhanaji, a cavalry rider who had served in the south. He rode beside a man named Nagoji Sawant in the old wars, and he came home with a jeweled knife and stories that made other men sit straighter. He married. He raised a son. He watched that son rot.

I do not remember the first time I smoked. I remember the first time I needed to. The difference matters.

At first it was a pleasure I could afford. Then it was a necessity I could not. I sold my horse. I sold my sword. I sold my mother's bangles. I sold my father's patience a little at a time until there was none left.

When there was nothing left to sell, I stole.

I stole small things at first. Coins from sleeping men. Grain from unattended sacks. A ring from a drunken merchant who would not remember the loss in the morning.

Small thefts become large. Not because you become braver, but because hunger grows.

That is how I found myself at the temple.

---

The village temple sat on the edge of the fields, a squat stone building with a small tower and a courtyard where children played during festivals. By day it smelled of ghee lamps and marigold. By night it smelled of damp stone and bat droppings.

I went there after midnight with the taste of opium still coating my tongue and my hands trembling for more.

The temple had a donation box. Everyone knew it did. Men dropped coins into it after prayers and told themselves the gods were watching. The gods were not watching. The pujari watched. The pujari always watched.

I crept across the courtyard barefoot, stepping around puddles, avoiding the loose stones that would click underfoot. The sky was moonless. The world felt close, as if the darkness itself had hands.

The door was not locked. A temple door is rarely locked. Men believe sanctity is stronger than wood.

Inside, the air was cooler. The idols loomed in the half light, faces black with oil and age. A rat skittered. Somewhere a bell chain moved slightly, stirred by wind or something else.

My mouth went dry.

I told myself I was not afraid of gods. I had not been afraid of gods for a long time. Opium had burned that fear out of me and replaced it with a different one.

I was afraid of waking up without the paste.

I crossed to the donation box and knelt, knife in my hand.

The lock was cheap. I could feel it through the blade as I pried, the metal resisting, then yielding with a small reluctant snap.

The box opened.

Coins glinted faintly inside.

For a heartbeat, I felt something like relief.

Then a voice came from behind me.

"Who is there?"

The pujari's voice was not loud. It did not need to be loud. It was the voice of a man who belongs to a place.

I froze, coin dust on my fingers.

The pujari held a small oil lamp. The flame made his face jump with shadow. He was older than I expected, his hair grey at the temples, his eyes sharp.

He looked at the open box.

He looked at my knife.

Then he looked at my face.

His eyes widened.

"Dhanaji's son," he whispered.

The words should have stopped me.

They should have pulled me back into the world where fathers matter and shame can still cut.

Instead they ignited something in me.

Opium makes you selfish. It makes you believe your need is the only need in the world. It makes other people's lives feel like obstacles.

The pujari stepped forward, lamp held high, and I saw what he was going to do.

He was going to shout.

He was going to wake the village.

He was going to drag my father's name through mud.

I moved before thought formed.

The knife flashed.

The pujari's mouth opened.

No sound came out.

His lamp fell, the flame licking across the floor before dying in spilled oil.

He collapsed against the stone, hands clawing at his throat.

Blood pooled dark and thick.

For a moment I stood there, coin dust on my fingers, watching him twitch.

I had seen men bleed before. I had seen animals slaughtered. I had watched my own veins stand out when the craving hit too hard.

This was different.

This was a priest.

This was a man who had spoken my father's name.

The temple felt smaller.

The idols felt closer.

Somewhere outside, a dog barked once.

Then another voice shouted in the courtyard.

"Pujari?"

Footsteps ran.

---

The Deshmukh's son came in with a torch.

He was young, strong, dressed in cloth too fine for this hour. He had been drinking, I could smell it, but he moved with purpose. He had heard the bark, the shout, the disturbance, and he had come because that was what a Deshmukh's son does.

He saw the pujari on the ground.

He saw the blood.

He saw me at the open donation box.

For a heartbeat we stared at each other, and in that heartbeat I saw his whole life.

A man raised to believe he was responsible for order.

A man who would become his father's right hand.

A man who would have children and land and people who bowed when he walked past.

And I saw my own life reflected in his eyes.

A man with nothing but hunger.

He drew his sword.

"Drop it," he said.

His voice shook, not with fear, with fury. A temple defiled was an insult that demanded blood.

I should have dropped the knife.

I should have run.

I should have done anything but what I did.

But opium had made me stupid. It had stripped consequence from my mind. It had taught me that violence solves problems quickly.

I stepped toward him.

His sword came up.

We collided in the narrow space between idols and stone.

His blade caught my shoulder and scraped, hot pain flashing.

I struck back with the knife, low, desperate.

He jerked away, surprised. The knife cut his arm.

He swore and tried to bring the sword down again.

I ducked, slipped on oil, and drove the knife forward.

It went under his ribs.

The resistance was softer than I expected.

His breath left him in a thin sound.

His torch fell and rolled, flame licking, throwing light across the idols as if the gods were moving.

The Deshmukh's son stared at me, eyes wide, and then he sagged against the wall and slid down into the blood.

His sword clattered onto stone.

I stood over him, chest heaving, knife in my hand, and understood, too late, what I had done.

One death could be an accident.

Two is a pattern.

Outside, men shouted.

The village was waking.

---

They caught me before I reached the courtyard wall.

A farmer's stick cracked against my back. A fist hit my jaw. Someone grabbed my hair and yanked my head up so the torchlight could show my face.

"Bhalerao," a voice spat.

The name sounded like a curse.

Hands dragged me into the courtyard.

Women screamed when they saw blood on my clothes. Men shouted for rope. Someone ran to the Deshmukh's house.

I tried to speak.

I tried to explain.

There is nothing to explain.

They tied my wrists and pushed me to my knees in the mud.

The Deshmukh arrived with his guards before dawn, his face hard, his eyes red, his body moving like a man who has become pure rage.

He saw his son's body carried out of the temple.

He saw the dead pujari.

He saw me in the mud.

If he had killed me there, no one would have stopped him.

Instead he looked at the village elders and spoke in a voice that was almost calm.

"Trial," he said.

That was his mercy.

He wanted my death to be lawful.

He wanted everyone to watch.

---

The trial lasted less than a day.

What is there to debate when two bodies lie in front of a temple and the killer is tied in the courtyard?

The elders spoke of defilement.
The priest's family wept.
The Deshmukh did not weep. He stared at me as if his gaze could burn me alive.

Someone asked if I had been possessed.

The question made men laugh bitterly.

Possession was a story people told when they did not want to admit that a man could choose evil.

I was sentenced to death.

Not only death.

Disgrace.

They would brand me first, so that even if some miracle kept me alive, I would carry the truth on my face.

When the iron came out of the fire, I thought I would faint.

It was shaped into letters.

Marathi letters, the kind my mother had taught me to read when I was a boy and still had a future.

The man holding the iron did not hesitate.

He pressed it to my forehead.

The smell of burning flesh is not like any other smell. It is intimate. It is your body announcing that it has been violated.

Pain exploded through my skull. Light shattered behind my eyes. I screamed until my throat tore and the scream became a hoarse animal sound.

When they pulled the iron away, the world swam.

Someone poured water on my face.

The water hissed against the wound.

The village elder leaned close enough that I could smell betel on his breath.

"Brahmin-killer," he said, translating the letters for anyone who could not read. "Let him wear it."

They dragged me to the execution ground in the afternoon, the brand throbbing, the skin already swelling, the letters burned deep enough that they would never fade.

My father's name was being shouted in the crowd like an accusation.

Dhanaji's son.

Dhanaji's son.

---

I saw my father only when they forced me to stand.

The execution ground was a dry patch beyond the village where men hanged thieves and pretended justice was clean. A neem tree stood there, its branches heavy, indifferent.

They tied the rope.

They pushed me onto the stool.

The crowd surged closer.

The Deshmukh stood at the front, face still, eyes burning.

Then the crowd parted as if something sharp had cut it.

My father rode in.

Dhanaji looked older than he had the last time I saw him, which had been weeks before. Opium steals time. It makes you forget how fast people age when you are not watching.

He wore no armour. He carried a sword. His horse's flanks were lathered.

He took in the scene in one glance.

The dead bodies had already been burned, but their absence was still present, hanging like smoke.

His gaze found my face.

The brand.

I watched something in him tighten.

Not surprise.

Not confusion.

Grief.

Then his eyes shifted to the Deshmukh, and the grief hardened into something like iron.

"Uncle," my father called, using a word that was almost an insult. "Enough."

The Deshmukh's mouth twisted.

"Your son killed my son," he said.

My father nodded.

"He did," he replied.

The simplicity of it was worse than denial.

Then my father did something I did not expect.

He swung off his horse and walked toward the elders.

Men shouted. Guards raised spears.

My father did not stop.

He reached the elder and spoke low, words I could not hear.

The elder's face tightened. He shook his head.

My father said something again, more urgent.

The elder shook his head again.

My father looked at the rope.

Then he looked at me.

His eyes were steady.

No apology.

No comfort.

Only a command.

Go.

He drew his sword.

The crowd shouted.

Guards surged forward.

My father moved like the cavalryman he was. He cut one spear shaft, slashed another man's arm, shoved through bodies as if they were reeds.

Someone grabbed the rope and tried to pull it tight.

My father struck that man in the face with the flat of his blade and the man went down howling.

My father reached the stool, cut the rope above my head, and shoved me down.

"Run," he hissed, voice like gravel. "Do not look back."

I stumbled, fell into mud, tried to stand.

My father slapped my cheek hard enough to make my ears ring.

"Run," he repeated.

So I ran.

I ran through the crowd as men shouted and hands grabbed and someone threw a stone that cracked against my shoulder.

I ran because my father had commanded it, and for once in my ruined life I obeyed.

Behind me, I heard steel ring.

Then I heard my father's voice shout my name, not in anger, in something else.

The sound chased me into the trees.

---

I did not stop until the sun was low and my lungs felt shredded.

I collapsed in scrub beyond the fields, face pressed to dirt, and vomited bile and blood until there was nothing left inside me.

When I could breathe again, I lay still and listened.

No pursuit.

Only insects.

Only wind.

Only the dull ache of the brand swelling on my forehead like a second skull.

Then, faintly, I heard hooves.

I lifted my head.

My father's horse came trotting toward me, riderless, its reins dragging.

There was blood on its flank.

For a moment my mind refused to understand.

Then understanding arrived like a knife.

My father had not been escaping.

He had been buying time.

Time for me.

I sat in the dirt and made a sound that was not a sob, not a cry. My throat was too torn for that. It was a dry animal sound, and it tasted of ash.

I did not go back.

Cowardice and obedience look the same from a distance.

I took the horse and rode toward my father's house, keeping to small paths, head wrapped in cloth to hide the brand.

Night fell.

The village lights faded behind me like a life I had burned down.

---

My father's house was dark.

No lamp burned inside.

No voice called my name.

The door hung slightly open as if someone had left in haste or had not cared enough to close it.

I stepped inside and smelled stale smoke and old sweat. The room looked smaller than it had when I was a boy. Opium shrinks everything.

I went to the corner where my father kept his things.

The jeweled knife lay in its cloth wrap, the stones dull in the dark.

It had been given to him by Nagoji Sawant, a token from a life of war and loyalty I had never earned.

I took it.

Not because I deserved it.

Because I could not leave anything of value behind for the Deshmukh's men to take.

That was how I justified theft even then.

I found my father's letter too, folded and tucked in a wooden box, sealed with wax.

The letter was addressed to Ananthan Pillai in Travancore.

Ananthan was the new name Nagoji Sawant wore in the south.

My father had written it as an escape hatch for a son he must have known would fall.

I held the letter and felt my chest tighten.

He had planned for my ruin.

He had loved me anyway.

Outside, a dog barked.

I froze.

Then I heard men shouting in the distance.

The hunt had begun.

I wrapped the knife and the letter, slung them over my shoulder, and left my father's house without looking back.

The brand on my forehead throbbed with every heartbeat.

The pain was a reminder.

Not a punishment.

A message burned into flesh.

You are what you did.

I rode south into the dark with three ghosts on my back.

The pujari.

The Deshmukh's son.

And my father, dead in my place.
