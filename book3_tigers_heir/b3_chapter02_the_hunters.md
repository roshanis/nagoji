# Chapter 2: The Hunters

The first week was the worst.

Not because of the pursuit, though the Deshmukh's men were never far behind. Not because of hunger or cold nights under trees. The worst part was my own body turning against me.

Opium does not release its prisoners kindly.

For seven days, my muscles cramped as if invisible hands were twisting them. Sweat soaked my clothes, then dried, then soaked them again. My stomach heaved up everything I tried to swallow. My skin itched as if insects crawled beneath it. I shivered so hard my teeth clicked until my jaw ached.

There were moments when I would have crawled back to Sangamner on my hands if someone had promised me a pipe.

Then my father's face would rise in my mind, not as memory, as accusation.

He had died so I could run.

To throw that away for a handful of black paste would have been a betrayal even I could not commit.

So I kept moving south, sick and shaking, with the brand on my forehead burning whenever the cloth slipped.

---

On the second night I stopped in a dry streambed and tried to sleep.

I lay under thorn scrub, the horse tethered close enough that I could hear it breathe. The knife was tucked under my belt. The letter was tied to my chest inside my shirt, as if keeping it there could keep my father's voice close.

Sleep did not come.

When I closed my eyes, I saw the temple floor, dark blood pooling, the pujari's lamp rolling, the Deshmukh's son staring at me as the life left him.

When I opened them again, the night was full of shapes that were not there.

Withdrawal is a kind of haunting.

By dawn my hands were shaking so hard I could barely tighten the saddle.

I mounted anyway.

Movement was the only thing that kept the ghosts from catching me.

---

The Deshmukh's reach was longer than I had understood.

At first I told myself the pursuit would end at the edge of his land. It was comforting to believe borders meant something.

Then I reached a small market village two days south and heard my own crime being sold like spice.

I had stopped at a well to drink. The cloth around my forehead was damp with sweat and slipped when I bent. For a heartbeat the brand showed.

The woman drawing water stared.

Her mouth opened.

I pulled the cloth back down and smiled, the way a man smiles when he wants to look harmless.

"Burned as a boy," I said quickly. "Stable fire."

The lie tasted familiar. Lies are easy when you are already disgusting to yourself.

The woman did not smile back. She backed away, eyes narrowed, and the fear in her face told me she had not believed a word.

I filled my mouth with water and forced myself not to drink too fast.

Across the well, two men in travel-stained turbans were talking.

"One hundred mohurs," one of them said.

The number made the other whistle.

"For a thief?" he asked.

"Not a thief," the first man replied. "A priest-killer. A Deshmukh's son. Branded on the forehead. They say his own father died to free him."

The second man spat into the dust.

"Then his father was a fool," he said.

They laughed.

I kept my head down and drank slowly, listening as if the story was not mine.

One hundred mohurs.

Enough gold to turn a poor man into a hunter.

Enough to make kindness rare.

I left the well without looking back, and within an hour I saw the first sign that the hunters were near.

Horse tracks on a damp patch of ground.

Fresh.

Not mine.

I urged my horse into a walk, forcing it to conserve strength. A fleeing man wants to gallop. A surviving man knows better.

---

On the fourth day, the hunters almost took me.

The road narrowed between low hills, scrub thick on both sides. I smelled ambush before I saw it. Fear has a scent when you have earned it.

My horse's ears flicked forward, then back. It snorted, unhappy.

I slowed.

The silence ahead felt too deliberate.

Then a man stepped onto the road with a spear in his hand and a grin on his face.

"Ho," he called. "Brother. Where are you going in such a hurry?"

Behind him, two more men rose from the scrub.

Their faces were ordinary.

Their eyes were not.

They looked at me the way men look at a goat they plan to slaughter.

I forced my face into a smile.

"South," I said. "To sell horses."

The lead man tilted his head.

"Show us your face," he said.

My throat tightened.

The cloth around my forehead felt suddenly too thin.

I could have turned and run.

They would have thrown spears into my back.

So I did what my father had taught me long ago, when I was still worth teaching.

I acted as if I belonged.

I rode forward.

"Why?" I asked, voice bored, annoyed, as if their request was an inconvenience.

The lead man stepped closer, spear tip lifting.

"Because there is a priest-killer on the road," he said. "And the Deshmukh pays well for his face."

My heart hammered.

I shrugged.

"Then go find him," I said.

I lifted my hand as if to adjust my saddle girth.

Instead my fingers closed around the knife.

The lead man saw the movement.

His grin vanished.

"Stop," he barked.

I did not stop.

I kicked my horse hard in the ribs and threw my body low over its neck.

The horse surged forward.

The spear flashed toward my face.

I felt the point scrape my cheek, hot and shallow.

Then we were through.

Behind me, men shouted and ran.

I heard hooves.

One rider had a horse too.

The chase began.

---

The land was dry and broken, scattered with boulders and thorn trees. A good place for an ambush. A bad place for a chase.

My horse knew it. It picked its way fast, hooves finding purchase where a less sure animal would have fallen.

The hunter's horse pounded behind, heavier, less trained.

I glanced back once and saw the man, face tight, spear in hand.

He was close enough that I could smell his sweat.

Close enough that the one hundred mohurs were shining in his eyes.

I turned forward again and searched for escape.

A narrow cut between rocks opened ahead, a ravine that led down toward a dry riverbed.

I aimed for it.

The ravine was just wide enough for one horse.

My horse slipped through.

The hunter followed without thinking.

That was his mistake.

In the ravine, speed means nothing. There is no room to pass. There is only the horse in front of you and the wall of rock on both sides.

I slowed suddenly.

The hunter's horse slammed into mine, startled, snorting.

The hunter cursed and lifted his spear.

I twisted in the saddle and threw my knife.

The blade hit him in the throat.

The sound was wet and small.

He dropped the spear and clawed at his neck, eyes wide, disbelief flooding his face.

His horse reared, panicked, and the hunter fell backward, hitting the rocks, blood spraying in the tight space.

I sat for a heartbeat, stunned by my own speed.

Then I kicked my horse forward and burst out of the ravine into the open riverbed beyond.

Behind me, the hunter's horse screamed.

My stomach turned.

I had killed again.

Not a priest this time.

Not a Deshmukh's son.

A man who wanted gold.

It did not matter.

Blood is blood.

I rode until my arms shook, then rode more.

By nightfall I reached a larger road, where carts moved and strangers' faces blurred together.

I hid among them, head wrapped tight, eyes down, body aching with withdrawal and violence.

Somewhere behind me, the Deshmukh's hunters would find the body in the ravine and understand that I was still alive.

They would not stop.

Neither would I.
