# Chapter 5: The Ghats

The Ghats rose before me like a wall between worlds.

I had been walking and riding for weeks since Sangamner, moving through lands that grew stranger with every mile. The Deccan had been dry and familiar in its cruelty. The Carnatic had been hot and crowded with new tongues and Company shadows.

Now the road turned toward mountains.

Not the brown broken ridges of my childhood, but a green barrier crowned with mist. From a distance the hills looked soft. Up close they were teeth.

The traders called them the Western Ghats.

The barrier between the east and the pepper coast.

Men had crossed these mountains for centuries carrying spices one way and silver the other, but the paths were narrow and the jungle did not forgive mistakes.

I crossed anyway.

I had no other direction left.

---

I joined a small group of pepper traders heading west.

They were not generous men. Trade does not make men generous. But they were practical. A rider with a horse can be useful on a mountain path, especially when bandits watch the passes.

They asked my name.

"Govind," I said.

They asked about the cloth around my forehead.

"Fire," I said.

They accepted it the way men accept any story that does not cost them money.

The first day into the Ghats, the air changed.

The heat softened. The wind smelled of wet leaves. The ground underfoot turned dark and spongy, holding water the way a sponge holds blood.

Birds screamed from the canopy. Monkeys hurled fruit and insults down from branches. Leeches found my ankles within an hour.

I slapped at them and swore.

The traders laughed.

"The mountain wants you," one said.

He meant the leeches.

He might have meant something else.

By the second day, mist wrapped around us so thick it felt like cloth.

We moved in single file along paths cut into rock, the drop to one side hidden by white emptiness. A wrong step would not kill you quickly. It would simply remove you from the world.

My horse snorted and stepped carefully, hooves finding purchase where my eyes could not.

I trusted the animal more than I trusted my own judgement.

That was a new kind of humility.

On the third day, we found tiger tracks in the mud.

They were fresh, the paw prints deep, the claw marks faint but present. The traders stopped and stared for a moment, then moved on faster.

No one spoke.

Fear in the jungle is quiet.

I stared at the tracks longer than the others did.

The tiger had walked this path with confidence.

No brand on its face.

No ghost on its back.

It killed because it was built to kill.

I killed because I was broken.

The difference mattered.

---

We reached the crest on the fifth day.

The mist thinned. The air tasted of salt.

Then, through a break in the trees, I saw the world on the other side.

Green.

Not the occasional green of a Deccan monsoon.

A green that looked endless, layered, alive. Coconut palms rose like spears. Backwater channels glinted in the distance. And beyond everything, a pale line that took my breath.

The sea.

I had seen rivers. I had seen lakes. I had seen the wide grey backwater mouths near the coast.

This was different.

This was a horizon that refused to end.

One of the traders watched my face and laughed softly.

"First time?" he asked.

I nodded.

He spat into the dirt.

"The sea makes men feel small," he said. "That is why the gods like it."

We descended into the pepper coast.

The air grew heavy again, not with heat, with moisture. Sweat returned immediately. My clothes clung to my skin. Every breath felt thick.

And everywhere, the smell.

Pepper.

It was in the air, sharp and sweet at once. It rose from vines climbing tree trunks, from drying mats near huts, from sacks loaded onto boats.

The coast was built on that smell.

On the sixth day after the crest, we reached a town by the backwaters where boats moved like silent animals through green water.

Men spoke Malayalam, the words sliding and curling in a way my tongue could not imitate. Women wore cloth draped differently, their bangles clinking. Even the temples looked different, painted brighter, carved with shapes I did not recognise.

I was still in India.

And yet I had stepped into another world.

That night, the traders slept in a warehouse near the water, and I sat outside listening to frogs and oars and distant drums.

I took out my father's letter and read it again by lamplight.

Travancore.
Ananthan Pillai.
Old debts.
The knife is his.

I traced the words with my finger as if touching them could bring my father back.

When the lamp flickered, I imagined his voice.

Go south.

Find him.

The next morning I left the traders and followed the coast road.

People stared at my forehead cloth. In the Deccan, men stared with contempt. Here, men stared with curiosity, as if every outsider was a story.

I asked for directions.

Most people shrugged.

Some pointed.

One old fisherman squinted at the name on my tongue and nodded slowly.

"Ananthan Pillai," he said. "Old man with soldiers in his bones."

He spat into the water.

"Go further south," he said. "Travancore side."

Travancore side.

The phrase made my chest tighten.

Not because Travancore was a salvation.

Because it was my last door.

By the time I saw the first markers of Travancore's border, the sky had darkened.

Clouds piled up heavy over the green.

The wind smelled of rain.

Monsoon was coming.

I pulled the cloth tighter around my forehead and walked toward the compound my father had named.

Somewhere ahead, an old Maratha who had become a Travancore man would look at my face and decide whether I deserved to live.
