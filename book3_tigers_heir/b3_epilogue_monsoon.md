# Epilogue: Monsoon

The monsoon does not care about kings.

It comes when it comes, vast and indifferent, turning roads into rivers and fields into mirrors.

It washes the dust off leaves.
It fills wells.
It drowns the careless.

People like to say rain cleanses.

They say it because they need to believe something can be washed away.

They have never tried to scrub blood out of stone.

---

In the last years of my life, the brand on my forehead faded, but it never disappeared.

The letters softened at the edges.
The scar tissue flattened a little.

But if you looked, if you really looked, you could still read it.

BRAHMIN-KILLER.

Children in the courtyard knew their father's face.

They did not know its story.

That was my one mercy to them.

Not because they did not deserve truth.

Because truth is heavy, and children should not carry what men like me have carried.

Mariam disagreed.

She believed secrets rot.

She believed a child should know what the world is and what his parents have done inside it.

We argued about it more than once, softly, at night, when the house was quiet and the frogs loud.

In the end, we did what married people always do.

We postponed the hardest truth and pretended that postponement was a decision.

---

On a day when the rain fell hard enough to turn the courtyard into a shallow lake, I put on my cloak and walked out.

Mariam watched me from the doorway.

"Where are you going?" she asked.

I did not lie.

"To the grave," I replied.

She nodded.

She did not try to stop me.

She knew there are journeys a man must make alone.

The path to Ananthan's grave ran through trees that dripped constantly, each leaf a small reservoir. Water slid down trunks. Mud sucked at my feet.

The air smelled of wet earth and green life.

It smelled like the world being born again and again without asking permission.

Ananthan was buried on a small rise, away from the backwaters, under stones that had been placed with soldierly precision.

No excessive carving.
No priestly poetry.
Just a name and a date and a silence.

I stood in the rain and let it soak my hair, run down my face, fill the grooves of the scar tissue on my forehead.

I thought of him as I had first seen him, old and cold, reading my father's letter and looking at me as if I were something dragged up from a drain.

He had been right.

I had been worse than a drain.

Then I thought of him later, when he handed me the talwar and told me that a soldier's weapon is not a prize, it is a debt.

I had paid some of that debt.

Not all.

No man pays all of it.

I knelt in the mud and placed my palm against the stone.

My hand shook slightly.

Not from fear.

From age.

And from memory.

Three ghosts stood behind me, as they always had.

The pujari, startled, bleeding on temple stone.
Vikram, brave and foolish, stepping into my knife.
Dhanaji, my father, dying so that his worthless son could run.

I had carried them through campaigns and across rivers.

I had carried them into my house.

I had carried them into my children's laughter.

The rain did not wash them away.

Rain does not wash ghosts.

It only makes them colder.

I thought of Caspar De Lannoy laughing at death.
Of Hendrik's face when the fire finally took his brother.
Of Dharma Raja bleeding into a boat and still managing to be king.
Of Tipu's body carried through smoke, a brave and terrible man reduced to flesh.
Of Doré's blood on stone and Blackwood's smile saying civilisation.

And then I thought of Mariam, stubborn and sharp and alive, building a life beside mine without pretending either of us were clean.

I rose, mud on my knees, rain in my eyes.

When I returned home, the house smelled of rice and wood smoke and damp cloth.

Mariam was by the hearth, stirring a pot, hair loose because the rain had stolen the braid's discipline.

She looked up at me.

Her eyes went to my face.

Not the brand.

The man.

She handed me a cloth without a word.

I wiped rain from my cheeks and stood for a moment watching my children, older now, moving through the room with the casual certainty of people who believe home is permanent.

On a shelf above the hearth, the jeweled knife lay wrapped in cloth.

Stolen from my dead father.

Cleaned.
Oiled.
Waiting.

For years I had told myself it was a reminder.

Now I understood it was a warning.

The knife had shaped me once.

It could shape my children if I failed them.

Mariam caught my gaze on the shelf and said quietly, "Do not let them become you."

Her voice held no accusation.

Only fear, the honest kind.

I nodded.

Outside, the rain hammered the roof.

Inside, the fire held.

Some things do not wash.

Some things we carry.

For as long as we live, and in the stories that outlast us.
