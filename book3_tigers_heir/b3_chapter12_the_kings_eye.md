# Chapter 12: The King's Eye

The first time I saw Dharma Raja properly, I understood why men called him pious.

Not because he was surrounded by priests.

Because he looked at the world as if it had to be accounted for.

Most kings look at men as if men are decorations for a throne.

Dharma Raja looked at men as if they were numbers that could save or destroy a kingdom.

That kind of gaze is colder than anger.

Anger burns and passes.

Attention stays.

Revathi took her household guard to Padmanabhapuram for a court ceremony, the kind that brings nobles and merchants and priests into the same space and forces them to smile.

I went because I was told to.

No one asked if I wanted to stand in a palace courtyard with a brand on my face.

Wanting is for clean men.

We rode in with Revathi's palanquin at the centre, guards on either side, umbrellas held above her like a moving canopy. The road was slick. The palace gates rose out of green, tall and painted, guarded by soldiers with spears and matchlocks.

Inside, the courtyard smelled of sandalwood, warm oil lamps, and sweat trapped under silk.

Men bowed.
Women watched from shaded balconies.
Priests murmured.

I stood with the other guards near a pillar, trying to make my body look smaller than it was.

It did not help.

The brand made sure of that.

Ananthan was there too, not close to Revathi, not far. He wore plain cloth and looked like a man who would rather be anywhere else.

Kesava stood beside him, posture stiff, eyes scanning.

When Kesava's gaze found me, his mouth tightened.

He did not look away.

He wanted the court to see that he was not associated with the stain.

Then Dharma Raja entered.

No drums.
No dramatic announcement.

He walked in with a small escort, his cloth simple, his posture straight. He looked younger than I expected, but his face carried the tiredness of a man who has spent too many nights listening to reports that smell of smoke.

His eyes moved through the courtyard and took everything in.

Not admiring.

Measuring.

I felt the gaze pass over Revathi like a hand, then over Ananthan, then over Kesava.

Then it landed on me.

For a heartbeat, the courtyard sound faded.

The king's eyes held my forehead.

The brand.

The raised letters.

The shame burned into flesh.

I felt my stomach twist and my hands go cold.

The instinct to bow too low rose in me.

The instinct to flee rose too.

I did neither.

I stood still and let the king look.

Dharma Raja's gaze did not change.

No disgust.
No anger.

Only curiosity, sharp and calm.

He shifted his gaze to Ananthan.

He spoke in Malayalam, quiet enough that only those close heard.

Ananthan replied in the same low voice.

I did not hear the words.

I saw the exchange.

Dharma Raja asked a question.
Ananthan answered.

The king looked at me again.

Then he looked away as if my brand was a line in an account book that had been noted.

The ceremony continued.

Priests chanted.
Nobles bowed.
Merchants smiled.

I stood with sweat running down my spine and felt a strange sensation.

Not relief.

Recognition.

The king had seen me.

He had not flinched.

That was worse than flinching.

It meant I was now part of the kingdom's calculations.

---

After the ceremony, Revathi received audience in a smaller room where decisions were made without incense.

She took Kesava and two guards with her.

Not me.

The brand was useful in the yard, as a warning and a spectacle.

It was not useful near a king's breath.

So I waited outside with the other guards and watched courtiers move like fish through water.

A Brahmin priest passed and his gaze caught my forehead.

His face tightened.

He stepped closer, robe brushing the stone.

"How does a temple defiler stand in a king's courtyard?" he hissed in Malayalam.

The question was not for an answer.

It was for humiliation.

My hands clenched.

I forced them open.

I remembered Ananthan's lesson.

Control.

The priest leaned in.

"Your shadow defiles the stone," he whispered.

His breath smelled of betel and superiority.

I stared at him and said nothing.

Silence is a weapon too.

The priest's lip curled.

"You think you can be remade?" he murmured. "Stone does not change its nature."

Then a voice cut in, sharp and amused.

"Stone changes every monsoon," Revathi said.

She stood in the doorway, her audience finished, her umbrella bearer behind her.

The priest stiffened.

"Lady," he began, bowing, trying to wrap his insult in respect.

Revathi smiled without warmth.

"If his shadow offends you, stand in the sun," she said.

The priest's face tightened.

Revathi leaned closer, her voice lowering.

"The king needs walls," she said. "Walls are built by men. Men are never pure."

The priest swallowed and backed away, bowing again.

Revathi turned to me.

Her eyes flicked to my brand, then to my hands.

"Do not touch priests," she said softly.

It was not kindness.

It was instruction.

"They scream louder than soldiers when they bleed," she added.

Then she walked past me as if the conversation had never happened.

Kesava emerged behind her, face tight, eyes flicking to the priest, then to me.

He did not speak.

He did not need to.

He was angry at Revathi for defending me.

He was angry at me for existing.

We rode back from Padmanabhapuram under a grey sky.

I kept hearing the king's silent gaze in my mind.

It had not offered forgiveness.

It had offered a question.

What do we do with a man like this?

I did not know the answer yet.

I only knew that Travancore had noticed me.

That is how a kingdom begins to own you.
