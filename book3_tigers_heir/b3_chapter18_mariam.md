# Chapter 18: Mariam

In the morning, the camp looked worse.

Night gives refugees a thin mercy. Darkness hides the scale of the ruin. At dawn, the light returns and shows you what you are expected to manage with buckets and prayers.

Children with fever.
Old men who had stopped eating.
Women with blood on their skirts and no explanation offered.

The smell had settled into everything. Smoke, sweat, damp cloth, the sourness of bodies that have been hungry too long.

Kesavadas's clerks arrived with palm-leaf bundles and reed pens.

"Names," one of them said to the camp, voice forced into authority. "We need names. We need villages. We need numbers."

The refugees stared at him.

They did not trust numbers. Numbers are what soldiers use when they decide you are expendable.

Kesava elbowed me. "Help them," he muttered, meaning the clerks, not the refugees.

I walked into the camp and felt eyes track my forehead like fingers.

BRAHMIN-KILLER.

It was a sentence that never ended.

---

The woman from the firelight was standing near the water pots when I reached her.

She was distributing ladles of rice water with the briskness of someone who refused to let misery become theatre. Two boys carried the pot between them, shoulders straining. She did not waste motion. A ladle, a hand, a nod. Next.

When a man tried to push forward, she slapped his wrist with the ladle hard enough to make him yelp.

"Wait," she snapped in Malayalam. "You will not steal from children."

The man glared at her, then looked past her at me and saw my uniform.

His anger shifted target like a dog switching from a stick to a throat.

He opened his mouth.

She turned her head slightly and said one word, quiet but sharp.

"Enough."

The man shut his mouth.

It was not fear of me.

It was fear of her.

I watched her for a moment longer than I should have.

She looked up, met my gaze again, and raised her eyebrows as if asking whether I had come to drink rice water too.

I stepped closer.

"Who put you in charge?" I asked.

Her eyes flicked to my forehead.

Then to my boots.

Then back to my eyes.

"Hunger," she replied. "Hunger promotes people quickly."

One of the clerks approached, waving his palm leaf.

He spoke to her as if she was another item to be counted.

"Name," he demanded. "Village. Family."

She did not answer him.

She looked at me instead.

"Is he your dog?" she asked.

The clerk stiffened.

I kept my voice flat. "He is doing what the *Dalawa* ordered."

"And what did the *Dalawa* order you?" she asked.

The question was not defiance for its own sake.

It was assessment.

I realised then that she was doing the same thing I had learned to do on the road south. Reading men. Measuring what they would do when pressed.

"To keep this from turning into a riot," I said.

She nodded, as if approving the answer.

Then she turned back to the clerk.

"Mariam," she said, clipped. "From near Palakkad. My family is dead or scattered. Write that. It will save you time."

The clerk blinked, thrown off by directness.

"Father's name?" he insisted.

Mariam's jaw tightened.

For a moment I saw something raw under the discipline, like a wound uncovered.

"Do you want his name so you can summon him back from Mysore?" she said. "Or do you want it so you can feel useful?"

The clerk flushed.

I stepped between them, not threatening, simply occupying space.

Mariam's eyes did not drop. She watched me as if waiting to see whether I would turn my size into violence.

I had done that once.

Not again.

"Write Mariam," I told the clerk. "Write Palakkad. Write that she speaks Malayalam and Portuguese."

The clerk stared at me, annoyed at being corrected.

"How do you know she speaks Portuguese?" he snapped.

Mariam answered before I did, voice cool.

"Because the Portuguese factories are the reason my people learned it," she said.

The clerk opened his mouth, then shut it again when he realised he had no response that would not sound like an insult.

He wrote.

Mariam turned back to the pot and resumed ladling rice water as if the conversation had been a fly she had brushed away.

---

When the line thinned, I stayed.

Not because I was fascinated by her work. I had seen women work in every camp and every village. Work is what poor people do while the powerful make speeches.

I stayed because she did not behave like a refugee.

Refugees apologise for existing. They fold themselves small so that soldiers will not notice them.

Mariam took up space like a woman who expected the world to make room.

"You do not bow," I said finally.

She gave a small humourless smile.

"I bowed enough on the road," she replied. "It did not save anyone."

I nodded, understanding more than I wanted to.

I leaned on the edge of the water pot and watched her hands.

They were steady.
Not delicate.
Not trembling.

Hands that had lifted bodies.

"What did you see?" I asked.

Her ladle paused mid-air.

The camp's noise went on around us, children coughing, men arguing quietly, a baby finally crying as if remembering it was alive. But in that moment there was a silence around her.

"You are a soldier," she said. "You already know what I saw."

"I know what soldiers do," I replied. "I want to know what was done to you."

She stared at me for a long moment.

Then she said, "They burned the church first."

Her voice remained controlled, but the words were heavy.

"Not because they needed the wood," she continued. "Because they wanted the smoke to rise and tell the villages around us that resistance has a smell."

I felt my fingers tighten on the pot rim.

She kept speaking.

"They gathered the men in the yard. They asked who would take the new faith. Some did. Some refused. They made the refusals public."

She glanced away for the first time, eyes on the ground, and I saw that looking away was not weakness. It was restraint.

"My father argued with an officer," she said. "He spoke too long. He believed words still mattered."

She looked back at me.

"They killed him in front of us," she finished. "Then they told us to walk."

Walk.

The word carried everything.

"Where?" I asked.

She shrugged slightly.

"North," she said. "Away from the sea. Away from our churches. Away from the pepper. Away from anything that could remind us we had once been people and not cattle."

I stared at her.

In my mind I saw the road south I had walked, sick and hunted, but my misery had been of my own making. No army had marched me at spear point.

Mariam continued.

"Some escaped," she said. "Some were helped by Muslims who did not want Tipu's men in their villages either. Some were helped by Hindus who would not abandon neighbours. Some were helped by thieves who smelled profit."

She smiled again, bitter.

"Mercy has many faces," she said. "So does greed."

I found myself nodding.

She watched me and then said, quieter, "What does it feel like, having it written on your face?"

The question did not come with disgust.

It came with curiosity, almost clinical.

I touched the scar tissue without thinking. The letters were rough beneath my fingers.

"It feels like heat," I said. "Even when there is no fire."

Her eyes narrowed.

"Did you do it?" she asked.

I could have lied.

But the brand has its own discipline. It makes lies pointless.

"Yes," I replied.

Mariam studied me, and I waited for the recoil, the judgement, the polite step back.

Instead she nodded, as if confirming a detail in a story.

"Then you know," she said.

"Know what?" I asked.

She lifted the ladle and poured rice water into a child's hands.

"What it is to be marked," she said. "What it is to have no clean way back."

I felt something shift in my chest.

The camp was full of marked people, but most marks were invisible.

Hers had been burned into memory.

Mine had been burned into skin.

Kesava called my name from the edge of the camp, impatient.

I turned my head.

"Coming," I replied.

When I looked back, Mariam was watching me again.

"If you want to keep this camp from becoming a riot," she said, voice low, "you will need more than soldiers."

"What do you mean?" I asked.

She gestured toward the line of refugees.

"You will need someone who can speak to them without sounding like a threat," she said. "Someone who can translate fear into instructions."

I stared at her.

She stared back.

Then she added, almost as if daring me to refuse, "And someone who can count without turning people into numbers."

I looked at the clerks with their palm leaves, at the guards with their spears, at the children with their hollow faces.

Then I looked at Mariam.

"Come to Kesavadas's tent," I said. "We need you."

Her mouth tightened, suspicious.

"Need is a dangerous word," she said.

"So is hunger," I replied.

For the first time, her expression softened by a fraction.

"Fine," she said. "But understand this, soldier. I will not be grateful for crumbs. I will work for what keeps people alive. If your king uses me like a tool, I will bite."

I should have been offended.

Instead, I felt a strange relief.

Tools that bite are harder to break.
