# Chapter 6: The Gate

Ananthan Pillai's compound did not look like the house of a legend.

In my father's stories, men like Nagoji Sawant lived behind high walls with banners and guards in polished armour. They sat in halls where the floor shone and servants brought silver cups without being asked.

The compound I found was quieter.

A low wall of laterite stone.
A gate made of thick wood darkened by rain.
A courtyard swept clean, not by pride, by habit.

Inside, I could see stables and a small training yard where men moved with spears in their hands, their feet sure in the mud.

The air smelled of wet earth and horses and pepper vines.

It smelled like work.

That was the first warning.

Travancore did not worship men.

It used them.

---

The gate guard looked at me with narrowed eyes.

He was Nair, I could tell from the way he held himself, from the way his spear felt like an extension of his arm. He wore a simple cloth and a waist belt, and his chest was marked with old scars that spoke of service.

"Who are you?" he demanded in Malayalam.

I answered in Marathi first, stupidly, then corrected myself with the few Malayalam words I had learned from the road.

"I have letter," I said, and my accent made the words clumsy. "For Ananthan Pillai."

The guard's eyes flicked to my forehead cloth.

"Fire?" he asked.

The lie almost rose automatically.

Then I remembered my father's letter.

Tell him I died for you.

Lies would not save me here.

"Let me see him," I said, and my voice sounded like begging.

The guard's mouth tightened.

He spat into the mud.

"Wait," he said.

He disappeared into the courtyard.

I stood at the gate and felt the weight of the knife under my belt and the letter against my chest.

The brand on my forehead throbbed under the cloth as if it wanted to announce itself.

The sky darkened further.

Rain began to fall, light at first, then heavier, the first fingers of monsoon.

By the time the guard returned, my hair was wet and my clothes clung to my body.

"Come," he said, grudging.

The gate opened.

I stepped inside.

---

Ananthan Pillai stood near the training yard watching spear drills.

He was older than I expected.

In my father's stories he had been a storm on horseback, a Maratha rider with a blade that cut through Dutch lines and a voice that made men obey.

The man in front of me was grey-haired, his beard trimmed, his shoulders still straight but narrower than they would have been in youth. He wore simple cloth and a light breastplate that looked worn, not ceremonial.

His face was plain.

His eyes were not.

His eyes were the eyes of a man who has watched enough men die that death has become a kind of measurement.

He turned when the guard spoke, and his gaze fell on me.

The cloth on my forehead was wet. It had loosened.

For a heartbeat, the brand showed.

Ananthan's eyes narrowed.

He did not ask about fire.

He knew what a brand looks like.

His gaze dropped to my hands, to the way I held them too close to my body, as if trying to hide blood that was not there.

"Name," he said in Marathi.

The sound of Marathi in this wet green place made my throat tighten.

"Bhalerao," I replied.

Ananthan's face did not change.

"Whose son?" he asked.

I swallowed.

"Dhanaji's," I said.

For the first time, something flickered in Ananthan's eyes.

Not softness.

Recognition.

A man's name can still reach across years.

"Letter," Ananthan said.

I pulled it out with shaking hands and held it out.

Ananthan took it and broke the seal.

He read quickly, eyes moving with practised control.

As he read, the rain thickened.

The spear drills continued behind him, men moving in rhythm, as if my arrival was nothing.

Ananthan finished the letter and looked at me again.

"Where is he?" he asked.

My mouth went dry.

I forced the words out.

"Dead," I said. "He died. Saving me."

Ananthan held the letter loosely now, as if the paper had become heavier.

"Why did he need to save you?" he asked.

The question was simple.

It was also a blade.

I could have lied.

Stable fire.
Bandits.

But the brand on my forehead throbbed like a truth that would not allow lies.

"I killed a priest," I said.

Ananthan's eyes did not blink.

"And?" he asked.

My stomach twisted.

"And the Deshmukh's son," I whispered.

The rain hammered the yard now, loud enough to drown small sounds.

Ananthan's face went still.

Then he spoke.

"Show me," he said.

My fingers found the knife at my belt, slow. Then I pulled it free.

The jeweled knife.

Even in grey light, the stones caught a weak gleam.

Ananthan's gaze locked on it.

The training yard behind him seemed to quiet, as if the men had felt something shift.

Ananthan stepped closer and took the knife from my hand.

He held it the way a man holds a memory.

His thumb traced the hilt.

His eyes lifted to my face.

"You stole this," he said.

It was not a question.

My throat tightened.

"It was my father's," I said, and the sentence sounded pathetic even to me.

Ananthan's mouth tightened.

"It was mine," he said quietly.

The words hit me like a fist.

He did not mean he owned the metal.

He meant the knife carried a bond I had broken by taking it with unclean hands.

He stepped back and looked at the wet cloth on my forehead.

"Take it off," he said.

I lifted trembling fingers and unwound the cloth.

Rain hit the brand directly.

The scar tissue stung. The letters felt alive.

Ananthan stared at it for a long moment.

Then he looked at me with something like disgust.

Not because of the scar.

Because of what it meant.

"You come here with a murderer’s face," he said. "You bring my friend's letter and you bring my knife, and you think I will take you in."

The sentence was not shouted.

It was spoken with the cold precision of a man deciding where to place a gun.

I tried to speak.

I tried to say my father died.

I tried to say I would work.

Ananthan lifted his hand slightly and the words died in my mouth.

"Dhanaji was a good man," he said. "He did not deserve a son like you."

My chest tightened so hard I thought I might vomit.

Ananthan held the knife out toward me.

Then, deliberately, he did not give it back.

He turned and handed it to the guard.

"Put it away," he ordered in Malayalam.

The guard hesitated, then obeyed, eyes flicking to me with something like curiosity and contempt.

Ananthan turned back to me.

"Leave," he said.

The word landed like a death sentence.

I stared at him, rain running down my face, brand burning.

"My father wrote to you," I said, voice breaking. "He said you would remember. He said you owed him."

Ananthan's eyes hardened.

"I do remember," he said. "That is why I am not killing you."

He stepped closer, and his voice dropped.

"Do you know what it means to kill a priest?" he asked. "In this land, it is not only murder. It is defilement. It is a stain that does not wash."

He glanced at my forehead.

"They burned it into you because they wanted you to carry it forever," he said. "And you will."

He leaned in slightly.

"Travancore does not need your stain," he finished.

He stepped back.

"Go," he repeated, louder now.

The guard at the gate took my arm.

Not gently.

He pulled me toward the opening.

I stumbled in the mud.

No one helped.

Men in the training yard kept drilling.

Spears moved.

Feet stamped.

Work continued.

As if my father had not died for me. As if the world had not changed. As if I was nothing.

The gate opened and I was pushed out into the rain.

It slammed shut behind me.

I stood in the mud, bareheaded now, the brand exposed, rain washing over it and doing nothing.

For a moment I considered walking into the backwater and letting the water take me.

It would have been easy.

It would have been clean.

Then I remembered the horse coming riderless out of the dark.

My father had bought my life with his.

If I threw it away, his death would become meaningless.

So I stood at the gate and waited in the rain, not knowing what I was waiting for.
