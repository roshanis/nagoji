# Chapter 32: What We Carry

When Tipu died, men expected the peninsula to exhale.

They expected the fear to drain out of the air like smoke after rain.

Instead, a different fear moved in.

Not a fear of rockets.

A fear of paperwork.

---

We returned to Travancore with the allied army's dust still in our hair.

The march south felt longer than the march north, because the purpose had been stripped away.

On the way up, every mile had been a step toward ending something.

On the way back, every mile was a step into a future we did not understand.

News travelled faster than we did.

Tipu was dead.
Seringapatam had fallen.
The Company was dividing Mysore like meat on a table.

By the time we reached Travancore's borders, villages had already begun to speak of the British as if they were kings.

Not openly.

Not yet.

But language changes first, and then everything else follows.

Kesava rode beside me in silence for most of the journey.

He was still himself, still hard, still restless, but something had settled in him after Seringapatam.

Not peace.

Knowledge.

"We killed the tiger," he said one evening as we camped near a stream, voice low. "And now we will have to feed whatever replaces it."

I did not answer.

Because I knew he was right.

---

Dharma Raja was already dead when we returned.

He had died in 1798, before the final war, before Tipu's fall, before the British could fully show what their protection meant.

I had saved his life at Alleppey.

I had not saved him from time.

The new Maharaja sat on the throne with a younger face and older eyes, already aware that his crown was weighed down by foreign attention.

When Kesavadas summoned me to court, I went in my uniform, scar uncovered, as always.

The hall smelled of oil lamps and wet cloth.

It smelled like a kingdom trying to keep its dignity while the world measured it.

Kesavadas stood near the throne, posture rigid.

He looked more tired than I remembered, as if every negotiation had taken a piece of him.

"Balan Pillai," he said quietly, using the name Travancore had given me. "You brought something back."

I had kept Tipu's tiger flag, the one taken in Kerala, stored and wrapped through years of uneasy peace and then the final war. I had kept it not as a trophy.

As a reminder.

I gestured to the guard carrying the bundle.

He stepped forward and unwrapped the cloth.

Green silk unfolded.

The tiger appeared, stitched in gold and black, mouth open forever, striding across fabric that had seen smoke.

The court murmured.

Some men smiled.
Some men looked away.

The new Maharaja leaned forward slightly, eyes narrowing, as if studying a beast he had only heard of.

Kesavadas spoke.

"This flag was captured in Travancore when Tipu retreated," he said. "It flew over our burned villages and our broken temples. Today it flies nowhere."

He nodded to me.

I stepped forward and held the pole upright.

The brand on my forehead burned under the court's gaze.

I did not lower my eyes.

I had lowered my eyes too much in my life.

"Your Highness," I said, voice steady, "Travancore still stands."

The Maharaja stared at the flag.

Then, unexpectedly, he looked at my face.

At the scar tissue.

At the letters that refused to fade.

He said quietly, "So do you."

For a moment I felt the old urge to laugh, bitter.

Standing is not the same as being whole.

But I nodded anyway, because kings do not ask for honest answers. They ask for symbols.

The flag was taken away and stored.

The court applauded politely.

Polite applause is how people pretend victory is simple.

---

When I returned home, Mariam was in the courtyard teaching our daughter to read.

The child sat cross-legged with a palm leaf in her lap, tongue caught between teeth in concentration.

Our son was chasing a chicken, laughing, unaware that empires existed.

Mariam looked up when I entered.

Her gaze went to my face.

Not to check the brand.

To check the man behind it.

She studied me for a long moment, then nodded.

You are here.

That was her language.

I sat on the verandah and watched my children move through sunlight.

They were neither Hindu nor Christian in the clean way priests prefer.

They were only themselves.

Mariam sat beside me with a cup of spiced water.

"Did they cheer?" she asked.

"They applauded," I replied.

Mariam snorted softly.

"Applause is cheap," she said. "Did they pay you?"

I almost smiled.

"No," I replied. "They paid the Company."

Mariam's expression hardened.

"Of course," she said.

The wind shifted.

From the north, faint, came the smell of smoke.

Not from war.

From kitchen fires.

From villages rebuilding.

From lives continuing, stubborn as weeds.

Kesava arrived at dusk, wet from rain, carrying a bottle.

He sat with me and drank, and for a while we spoke of small things.

Horses.
Old comrades.
The way the backwaters smell after a storm.

Then, as the bottle emptied, Kesava said quietly, "Do you remember what it was like, before all this?"

I looked out at the courtyard.

At my children.
At Mariam.
At the house we had built with laterite and stubbornness.

I thought of the Deccan.
Of temple stones.
Of the brand's heat.
Of Caspar's laughter.
Of Tipu's body carried through smoke.
Of Doré's blood on stone.

And I thought of Travancore in the years before, when fear was smaller and freedom felt like something you could hold in your hand.

"It was smaller," I said. "And more frightened. And more free."

Kesava nodded, eyes on the darkening sky.

"Yes," he said. "And now?"

I watched the first fireflies appear in the garden, tiny lights that did not care about kings.

Now, I thought, we will learn a different kind of war.

One fought with signatures and laws and men like Blackwood smiling.

I did not say it aloud.

Some truths are better left as silence between friends.

I drank the last of the spiced water and listened to my children laugh.

It was the only sound that felt like victory.
