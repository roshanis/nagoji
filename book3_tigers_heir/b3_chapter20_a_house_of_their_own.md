# Chapter 20: A House of Their Own

Love did not arrive in me like a poem.

It arrived like a bruise.

Slow.
Unwanted.
Tender when pressed.

I had spent years learning how to be hard. Travancore rewarded hardness. It gave you rank for it, land for it, a place in a hall for it. Hardness kept you alive when rockets screamed and men died in mud.

Love made a different demand.

It demanded that I stay soft in one place.

---

Mariam remained in the refugee camp long after the first wave had been resettled.

Kesavadas kept her close because she was useful. She could speak to Portuguese-speaking factors without bending. She could read accounts without pretending they were holy. She could translate grief into lists, and lists into orders.

Men like Kesavadas love people like that. Not because they are kind. Because they are rare.

At first I told myself I stayed near the camp because Kesava ordered it.

Then I told myself I stayed because Father Thomas needed guards when tempers rose.

Then I stopped lying.

I stayed because Mariam looked at my face as if the brand was not the only story written there.

When she spoke to me, she did not speak like a supplicant.
When she laughed, it was sharp, but real.
When she was angry, she did not hide it behind politeness.

She made my own careful hardness feel like cowardice.

One evening, after a day of arguments over rice stores, I found her sitting on an overturned basket outside Thomman Mappila's storehouse, rubbing her wrists as if the bones themselves ached.

Thomman's porters were loading sacks by lamplight, the air thick with the smell of pepper and sweat. A clerk argued over weights in rapid Malayalam.

Mariam watched it all with the tired focus of someone who had learned to stay awake by force.

"You look like you want to hit someone," I said.

She did not smile.

"I do," she replied. "I want to hit all of them. The Mysore men. The clerks. The merchants. The priests. God, if he is watching."

I sat beside her on the basket.

The wood was rough under my palms.

I said, "God is watching."

She looked at me sharply.

"Do not start preaching," she warned.

I snorted.

"I am the last man who should preach," I said.

Her gaze went to my forehead.

Then to my hands.

"Yes," she agreed quietly.

The agreement should have stung.

Instead it felt like relief.

No pretending.

For a long moment we sat in silence, listening to porters grunt and sacks thud onto carts.

Mariam spoke without looking at me.

"When you first spoke to me," she said, "I hated you."

"I noticed," I replied.

Her mouth twitched.

"You have a talent for understatement," she said. Then she added, softer, "I hated you because you were a soldier, and soldiers were the ones who made my father die."

I stared at the ground.

"And now?" I asked.

Mariam's fingers pressed into her wrist as if testing pain.

"Now I know soldiers are not one thing," she said. "Some burn villages. Some carry dead children. Some stand in the way so that others can run."

I felt my throat tighten.

She continued, voice flat with exhaustion.

"I do not forgive the world," she said. "But I can choose where to place my trust. Even if it is a small trust."

I turned my head and looked at her properly.

The lamplight caught the hollows under her cheekbones. Smoke had stained the ends of her braid even after weeks in Travancore. She looked older than her years, the way famine makes children look old.

I said, "I am not worth trusting."

Mariam looked at me, and for once her eyes held no humour.

"Then become worth it," she said.

It was the most intimate thing anyone had ever demanded of me.

---

When I told Kesava, he reacted as if I had announced I planned to poison the king.

"A Christian?" he hissed, in the privacy of the stable yard. "A refugee?"

He paced like a caged animal.

"Do you want to make enemies of every temple in Travancore?" he demanded. "Do you want to make enemies of her people too? They will call her a whore for touching you. They will call you a dog for touching her."

He stopped and jabbed a finger toward my forehead.

"You already wear one crime on your face," he snapped. "Do you want to add more?"

His anger was not only disgust.

It was fear.

Kesava had grown up inside the kingdom. He believed in its rules the way a fish believes in water.

I said, "I am already outside."

Kesava stared at me.

"You think you are outside," he said, voice low. "You are inside enough to be killed for embarrassing the wrong priest."

He turned away, shaking his head.

"She will not thank you for dragging her into your shame," he muttered.

"I am not dragging," I replied.

Kesava looked back at me, eyes hard.

"Then why are you doing this?" he asked.

I did not have a clean answer.

I had never had clean answers.

I said, finally, "Because I want something to protect that is not only the king's banner."

Kesava stared at me for a long time.

Then he exhaled, defeated.

"Then do it properly," he said. "If you must break the world, at least do it with ceremony."

---

Revathi surprised me.

When I approached her with the request, I expected laughter, or contempt, or a lecture about foolish men and their appetites.

She listened without interrupting, eyes half-lidded as if bored.

When I finished, she tapped her finger once on the arm of her seat.

"A Syrian Catholic girl," she said. "From the smoke."

"Yes," I replied.

Revathi's gaze flicked to my forehead and lingered.

"And a man with burned letters on his face," she added. "Travancore collects strange objects."

I did not know whether to be insulted.

Revathi smiled, small and sharp.

"Do you think you are the first man in this kingdom to love outside his permission?" she asked.

I kept my face blank.

Revathi leaned forward slightly.

"Ananthan married me when he was still called Nagoji by men who hated him," she said. "The priests found ways to bless what they wanted to condemn, because kings always need swords."

She waved a hand.

"The Syrians will complain," she continued. "The Brahmins will complain. The Nairs will whisper. Let them. Complaints do not stop a house from being built."

She looked at me directly.

"Do not ask me for approval," she said. "Ask me for what you actually need."

I swallowed.

"A priest," I said. "And protection from the priests who will try to make this into a riot."

Revathi nodded.

"Father Thomas will marry you," she said. "He has more sense than most men in robes."

"And the Brahmins?" I asked.

Revathi's smile turned colder.

"A Brahmin will perform something from a distance," she said. "Not because he believes you are clean. Because he believes I am dangerous."

The way she said it made it sound almost like mercy.

It was not.

It was leverage.

---

The wedding was small, because large weddings invite spectators, and spectators invite stones.

Father Thomas chose a chapel that was barely a chapel, a whitewashed room with a wooden cross and a lamp that smoked because the oil was poor. A bell hung outside that had once been Portuguese. It rang with a thin, sad sound.

Mariam stood before the cross in a plain sari, hair braided, eyes steady. A small silver cross lay against her throat.

I stood beside her in my uniform because it was the only clothing that gave me legitimacy, and because if I dressed like a villager, the villagers would remember what I had been.

My forehead was uncovered.

If I was going to be shamed, I would not be shamed by hiding.

Father Thomas began the prayers in Syriac, the old words flowing like water over stone. I understood nothing, but I felt the weight of the sound. It was a language that had survived empires by refusing to die.

When he switched to Malayalam, I understood enough.

He asked Mariam if she chose this.

"Yes," she said, voice clear.

He asked me if I chose this.

I looked at Mariam, then at Father Thomas.

The priest I had killed flashed in my mind. So did the brand. So did my father dying in the dust so I could run.

"Yes," I said.

Father Thomas looked at my face for a long moment.

Then he said quietly, for my ears only, "Do not make this woman carry your ghosts."

I nodded.

He placed a thin cord in Mariam's hand and then in mine, tying our wrists together.

Not chaining.

Binding.

Mariam's skin was warm against mine.

For a moment I felt something I had not felt since childhood.

Safety.

It was terrifying.

Outside, thunder rolled, distant.

Kerala always threatens rain when you try to pretend your life is stable.

After the chapel, Revathi had arranged a separate ritual in her courtyard, a Brahmin chanting from a distance, refusing to look at my face directly. He did not touch me. He did not touch Mariam. He threw rice into the air as if trying to keep his hands clean by never letting grain rest on skin.

It was absurd.

It was also, in Travancore, enough.

When the chanting ended, Revathi stood and regarded us as if judging livestock.

"At least he chose someone with spine," she said, loud enough for the priests to hear.

Mariam's mouth tightened, but her eyes glinted.

"Thank you," she replied, tone polite in a way that was not submission.

Revathi laughed once, delighted.

---

We built the house with our own money and other people's labour.

That is the truth of every house.

Thomman sold me timber at a price that was almost kind.

Kesavadas arranged land that sat close enough to the backwaters for trade and far enough from the main temple road to avoid daily insults.

Kesava sent men, grumbling but loyal, to help raise walls.

We used laterite brick that bled red when cut. We used jackfruit wood for beams, its fresh sap sticky on the hands. The air smelled of wet earth, sawdust, lime, and the faint sharpness of pepper from Thomman's sacks.

Mariam supervised the workers like a commander.

She argued with masons.
She counted bricks.
She refused to let men cheat us because they assumed a soldier did not understand building.

I watched her and felt something tighten in my chest.

This was not romance.

This was partnership.

When the roof went on, we stood under it and listened to rain drumming on palm thatch.

The sound was steady.

It made the world feel far away.

Mariam reached up and touched the scar tissue on my forehead with her fingertips, gentle.

The gesture made my skin prickle.

"It will never go," she said quietly.

"No," I replied.

She looked at me.

"Then we will build around it," she said.

Outside, beyond our new walls, the kingdom still trembled under the smell of smoke.

But inside, for the first time since Sangamner, I had a place that belonged to me.

Not because it was clean.

Because it was chosen.
