# Chapter 22: Breach

The night Tipu hit the Lines, the frogs went silent.

In the hours before the assault, the ditch had been alive with sound. Croaking. Insects. The constant wet whisper of jungle breathing.

Then, as the sky darkened and the rain held its breath, even the frogs stopped.

Men noticed.

Soldiers will laugh at omens in daylight, but at night they listen.

---

I was stationed behind the central section with my cavalry, not on the wall itself.

Cavalry is useless on a rampart. A horse cannot climb a firing step. A rider cannot lean over parapet stone and shoot down into a ditch without turning into a target.

Our job was to be the fist behind the shield. If the wall held, we would ride out through the gates and cut down stragglers. If the wall cracked, we would move to plug the crack before it became a mouth.

Kesava was posted two miles east with another troop. Hendrik and Caspar were on the gun platforms, their crews ready, powder protected under cloth, matchcords kept dry in tins.

I walked the inner road behind the wall and listened.

I could hear men whispering in the dark.
I could hear the clink of a ramrod against iron.
I could hear the soft scrape of sandals as labourers tried to sleep in trenches they had dug.

On the parapet above me, a sentry cleared his throat.

Then a sound rose from the north, thin and rising, like a kettle left too long on fire.

The first rocket.

It arced over the jungle canopy, a line of orange flame against black cloud, and slammed into the ditch with a crack that shook the earth.

Men shouted.

Then the second rocket came.

Then the third.

Then, like a choir finding its voice, the screaming multiplied until the air itself seemed to tear.

Tipu wanted us to understand.

The wall would not only be climbed. It would be burned.

---

"To the wall," I ordered, and my men moved, not running, not panicking, simply obeying.

That was what Ananthan had beaten into us. Panic is a luxury. Discipline is survival.

We reached a gap between gun platforms where the inner road rose slightly and gave a view over the parapet.

I climbed the firing step and looked out.

The ditch was full of smoke.

Not the slow smoke of kitchen fires.

Gun smoke, sulphur sharp, layered with the oily stink of rockets.

Shapes moved in it.

Tipu's infantry, disciplined, dark figures with shields and ladders, running in waves.

Behind them, men with tools.

Sappers.

They carried baskets, ropes, bundles of brushwood, anything that could fill the ditch enough for a ladder to stand.

And behind them again, the deeper shadow of Tipu's guns.

The first Mysorean cannon spoke, and the ball struck the wall with a dull thud that travelled through the stone into my teeth.

Hendrik answered.

Travancore's guns fired from the platforms, the recoil making the wooden carriages jump. The muzzle flash lit the faces of the gunners for an instant, eyes wide, teeth bared, sweat shining.

Grapeshot tore into the ditch.

Men fell.

The ditch swallowed them and kept moving.

The first ladder hit the wall.

A Travancore soldier leaned over and hacked at the hands climbing it with a billhook. Fingers flew. A man screamed and dropped.

Another ladder went up.

Another.

It was like watching ants climb a tree, endless and patient, except these ants had rockets and muskets.

Caspar ran along the parapet, shouting orders that cut through the noise.

He was not supposed to be there. An engineer should stay near his guns, protect powder, think, not shout.

Caspar could never stay where he was supposed to be.

He leaned over the parapet and fired a pistol into the smoke, point blank, then turned and laughed at something Hendrik yelled at him.

Madness.

Bravery.

The line between them is thin as fuse cord.

---

The first assault broke against the wall.

After an hour of screaming rockets and ladders and men dying in the ditch, Tipu's infantry pulled back, dragging wounded, leaving dead.

On our side, men leaned on muskets and coughed smoke out of their lungs.

Someone vomited over the parapet.

Someone began to laugh, high and broken, and then slapped himself to stop.

I climbed down from the firing step and walked along the inner road, checking on my troopers.

One of them, a boy with a beard barely grown, stared at his hands as if surprised they were still attached.

"They will come again," I told him.

He nodded, jaw clenched.

I looked up at the wall.

The parapet stones were chipped.
The stakes were blackened.
The ditch below was a stew of smoke, blood, and broken ladders.

The wall had held.

Holding is not winning.

Holding only means you have bought time.

---

The second assault came before dawn, when the men on the wall were most tired and the powder boys were half asleep.

This time the rockets fell not only into the ditch.

They fell onto the gun platforms.

One struck a stack of brushwood and turned it into a torch. Another hit a powder cloth and sent men scrambling, screaming, beating at sparks with their bare hands.

Hendrik bellowed orders, voice hoarse.

"Cover the powder," he shouted. "Cover it. If it goes, we all go."

Caspar ran into the smoke with a bucket.

I saw him climb onto the platform, hair slick with rain, eyes bright as if this was the moment he had been waiting for all his life.

He threw water on the burning brushwood and the steam rose, hissing.

Then a rocket struck near his feet.

The blast threw him backward.

For a moment I saw him in the flash, limbs spread, mouth open, not screaming, simply shocked.

He hit the stone hard and did not move.

Hendrik roared his brother's name, a sound that tore something in my chest.

Men surged toward Caspar.

Another rocket fell.

More men shouted.

The ditch filled again.

And then, at a section slightly west of us, I heard a different sound.

Not a rocket scream.

Not a cannon thud.

A deep, rolling crack.

Earth giving way.

The wall shuddered under my feet.

Dust rose from the parapet stones.

Somewhere ahead, men screamed, not in pain, but in sudden terror.

"Breach," someone shouted.

The word travelled fast.

It moved faster than orders.

It moved faster than courage.

I ran along the inner road, boots slipping in mud, shouting for my troopers to follow.

When I reached the section, the sight made my stomach drop.

A portion of the rampart had collapsed inward, the outer face cracked, the ditch partly filled with fallen earth.

Tipu's men were already there, climbing over the new slope like water finding a gap.

Travancore soldiers fought them on the broken edge, muskets clubbed, swords swinging, men slipping in mud and blood.

This was no longer a wall.

This was a mouth.

And the mouth was opening.

I drew my knife.

Not because a knife is the right weapon for a breach.

Because it was the only thing I carried that felt honest.

"Dismount," I ordered. "Form a line. Hold them."

My troopers dismounted and formed behind the collapsing section, horses snorting, eyes rolling, sensing the chaos.

I took a spear from a dead man and planted my feet in the mud.

Tipu's first men came over the breach, shouting, faces streaked with soot, eyes wild.

I drove the spear into the first chest.

The man folded.

The second jumped over him.

Kesava was not there.

Hendrik was not there.

Caspar was somewhere behind, silent on stone.

It was only us, mud, and the surge of Mysore.

We held for minutes.

Minutes feel like hours when you are counting breaths.

Then, from the north, more rockets screamed, and more men came, and the breach widened as if the earth itself had decided to surrender.

An officer on the wall shouted a retreat order, voice breaking.

My troopers looked at me.

If I said hold, we would die.
If I said run, we might save some.

I thought of Mariam in our house, oil lamp burning, waiting for a sound that would tell her whether to live or to flee.

I thought of the refugees who had walked into Travancore because they believed walls meant safety.

I thought of the brand on my face.

The world does not forgive.

The world only counts what you do next.

"Fall back," I ordered, voice raw. "Slow. Together."

We stepped back, spears and knives and muskets forming a shrinking fence.

Tipu's men poured through the breach.

The Lines, the great scar we had carved into the land, had been opened.

Behind us, Hendrik's guns kept firing, slower now, desperate, covering a retreat that tasted like ash.
