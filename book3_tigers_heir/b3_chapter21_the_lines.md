# Chapter 21: The Lines

In late 1789, Travancore did not answer Tipu with speeches.

It answered him with earth.

With ditch and rampart.
With sharpened stakes.
With men sweating in mud until their hands blistered and their backs broke.

Kings can be pious. Ministers can be clever. But when an army comes, the land itself must be persuaded to fight.

That was what the Lines were.

Persuasion made visible.

The *Nedumkotta* ran like a scar across the north, cutting the gap between the hills and the sea. In some places it was a wall of laterite, in others a high earthen rampart faced with stone. In front of it was a ditch deep enough to swallow a horse. Behind it were gun platforms and firing steps, places where men could stand and keep their heads low until it was time to kill.

It was not a single wall so much as a system. More than fifty kilometres of ditch and rampart, from the coastal flats into the Ghats. The ditch was six metres deep and five metres wide, a wound that could swallow men and ladders and still look hungry. Twenty bastions broke the line. Behind them, every three kilometres, there was a camp site and a well, because a wall is only as strong as the men who can eat, drink, and stay at it.

I rode it for weeks with Kesava, checking posts, speaking to captains, listening for the small problems that become disasters.

Mosquitoes rose from the ditch in clouds.
Leeches clung to ankles when the rain came.
The air smelled of wet earth and sweat and the faint sourness of fear.

On the wall, men hammered stakes into the top, the points angled outward like teeth. They worked with the grim focus of men who knew they might soon need to look down and see those teeth bloodied.

Hendrik De Lannoy met us at one of the main gun platforms.

He was older than the Pieter I had met years ago, and harder. Pieter had carried iron in his eyes. Hendrik carried obligation.

He greeted Kesava formally, then looked at me.

His gaze went to my forehead, stayed there, then moved on as if he had decided he did not have time for judgement.

"Your cavalry patrols are late," he said without greeting.

Kesava bristled.

"The road is mud," he snapped. "We are not cannon that can be dragged by oxen."

Hendrik did not smile.

"Mud does not stop rockets," he replied.

He turned and pointed toward the ditch.

"Tipu's scouts have been seen in those trees," he said. "Twice this week."

His voice remained calm, but his fingers tapped once on the gun carriage.

Nervousness disguised as precision.

I stepped closer to the parapet and looked north.

The jungle was thick, green, innocent as a priest's lie.

Somewhere inside it, men were watching us and measuring our wall.

I could not see them.

But I could feel them the way a man feels eyes on his back in a crowded market.

Caspar arrived late, as if punctuality offended him.

He came up the ramp with a rolled plan under his arm and mud up to his knees, laughing at something a labourer had said.

He looked at me and grinned.

"Balan Pillai," he greeted. "Still breathing. That is progress."

He slapped the wall with his palm.

"This," he declared, "is going to make Tipu furious."

Kesava muttered, "He will be furious enough to kill us."

Caspar's grin widened.

"Yes," he said, as if pleased. "At least the end will be interesting."

Hendrik's mouth tightened.

"Do not speak of death like it is a joke," he said.

Caspar shrugged.

"Death is never a joke," he replied. "That is why men laugh at it. If we did not laugh, we would lie down in the ditch and let the mosquitoes finish us."

I watched the brothers.

Hendrik looked like a man trying to hold a fort together with discipline.
Caspar looked like a man trying to hold himself together with fire.

They were both, in their own way, desperate.

---

The Lines were not only stone and earth.

They were politics.

Every village asked who would feed the labourers.
Every temple asked whether the wall would protect its idols.
Every Syrian church asked whether the wall would protect its crosses.

Mariam went north with me once, stubborn, refusing to remain in the safety of our new house while men built a barrier that would decide whether she lived.

She stood on the rampart in the rain, sari soaked, hair plastered to her neck, and watched labourers dig.

"They are making a grave," she said quietly.

I did not answer.

A man digging a ditch can pretend it is only a ditch.

A woman who has walked behind an army knows better.

That night, in a tent that smelled of damp canvas, I told her to go south.

Not as a request.

As an order disguised as love.

"If the wall falls," I said, "I want you away from the road. I want you near the sea, where you can flee by boat."

Mariam stared at me.

Her eyes were not angry.

They were insulted.

"Do you think I will survive by running again?" she asked.

"You survived once," I replied.

She leaned forward, voice low so that the guards outside would not hear.

"I survived because I learned when to run and when to bite," she said. "Do not turn me into a bundle you can throw onto a boat."

I felt heat rise in my face.

Not the brand's heat.

The heat of being seen.

"I do not want you to die," I said, and the words came out rougher than I meant.

Mariam's expression softened by a fraction.

"Then build a wall that holds," she said simply.

Then she added, almost gently, "And understand this, husband. I married you because you stopped running. Do not ask me to run so you can pretend you protected me."

I stared at her in the dim light and realised something that frightened me more than Tipu's scouts.

This woman was not my weakness.

She was my mirror.

Tipu did not strike the Lines in a single clean moment. He tested them for half a year, sending rockets as warnings and scouts as questions, while his sappers learned the ground and our labourers kept piling earth as if earth could outrun fear.

The first rockets we heard were far away.

Not seen.

Heard.

A thin screaming sound in the north, like metal tearing.

Men on the rampart froze, heads turning toward the jungle.

Hendrik lifted a hand, calm.

"Test shots," he said, as if explaining an exercise. But his knuckles were white on the parapet.

Caspar laughed once, sharp.

"He wants us to know he has them," he said. "He wants the sound to enter our dreams."

Kesava spat over the wall.

"Let him scream," he said. "We have guns."

Hendrik looked at him.

"Guns need powder," he said. "Powder needs dry storage. Dry storage needs roofs. Roofs leak in monsoon."

He said it with the dull fury of a man fighting nature while waiting to fight men.

I watched labourers haul baskets of earth and felt my stomach twist.

Walls are slow to build.

Fear is fast.

When the messenger arrived from the north, mud up to his thighs and terror on his face, I knew the wall had run out of time.

"Tipu is coming," he panted.

He did not need to say it.

The air already smelled of smoke.
