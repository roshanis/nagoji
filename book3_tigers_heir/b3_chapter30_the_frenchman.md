# Chapter 30: The Frenchman

The day after Seringapatam fell, the British tried to pretend the sack was discipline.

They posted sentries at gates.
They issued orders.
They hanged a few men caught with too much stolen cloth, as if cloth was the worst crime committed inside the fort.

But the damage had already been done.

A city does not become clean again because an officer decides it should.

Blood seeps into stone.

---

We found Colonel Doré in a small courtyard near a ruined storehouse.

He was not hiding.

He was standing with his hands tied, guarded by sepoys, his uniform torn and stained. His face was bruised, but his posture was straight.

A Frenchman looks different from an Englishman even when you strip him of dignity. His features were sharper. His moustache thinner. His eyes carried a kind of pride that did not need victory to exist.

Major Doyle led me there, because Doyle understood that a Catholic Frenchman and a branded Hindu cavalryman might recognise the same hypocrisy.

Doré looked up when we approached.

His gaze flicked to my forehead, then away, polite, as if refusing to stare was a form of civilisation.

An English officer stood beside Doré, reading from a paper as if paper could justify murder.

Captain Blackwood was there too, hands behind his back, smile faint.

Blackwood's eyes were bright.

He was enjoying this.

The English officer spoke in Portuguese for the benefit of the allies.

"Jean-Baptiste Doré," he announced. "Officer in the service of Tipu Sultan. Agent of the French Republic. Found within the fort. Taken with correspondence."

He held up a packet of papers, damp and stained.

"You are to be executed," the officer said.

There was no trial.

No debate.

Only sentence.

Doré listened without moving.

When the Portuguese translation finished, he spoke in accented Portuguese, voice steady.

"I served my master," he said. "As you serve yours."

The English officer's face tightened.

Captain Blackwood smiled wider.

"Your master is dead," Blackwood said in English, then repeated in Portuguese with a mocking softness. "And your nation is our enemy. You will die as an example."

Doré's eyes flicked to Blackwood.

"Examples are for children," he replied.

Blackwood's smile did not change, but his eyes hardened.

He wanted Doré to beg.

Doré would not.

---

They marched him to a wall near the river, where a firing party waited.

The morning was bright, cruelly clear, as if the sky wanted to witness.

The river flowed past, indifferent.

Doré walked without stumbling.

He did not plead.

He did not shout.

At the wall, an officer offered him a blindfold.

Doré refused with a small shake of his head.

"I will look," he said.

The officer shrugged.

British soldiers raised muskets.

They stood in a line, faces set, fingers on triggers, the routine of killing made respectable by uniform.

Major Doyle stood beside me, jaw clenched.

He whispered, "This is wrong."

I glanced at him.

"You serve them," I said quietly.

Doyle's mouth tightened.

"Yes," he replied. "And I hate myself for what that requires."

Doré looked at the firing party and said something in French, too quick for me to catch.

Then he spoke Portuguese again, voice low.

"Tell your Company," he said, looking past the rifles to Blackwood, "that killing men like me does not kill France. It only teaches the world what England is."

Blackwood's smile twitched.

He stepped forward.

"Fire," he ordered.

The officer hesitated, a fraction.

Then he repeated the command.

The muskets cracked together.

Smoke burst.

Doré's body jerked, once, hard.

He did not fall immediately.

His knees buckled slowly, as if his pride tried to keep him standing even as his blood left him.

Then he collapsed onto the stone.

A British soldier stepped forward and fired a pistol into Doré's head at close range, to be certain.

The sound was small compared to cannon.

It was intimate.

I felt my stomach turn.

This was not battle.

This was execution, clean and filthy at the same time.

Blackwood exhaled, satisfied.

"There," he said lightly. "Civilisation."

Major Doyle's hands clenched.

I watched Doré's blood seep into the stone.

A Frenchman had died for serving Tipu.

My father had died for saving me.

Men die for masters.

The masters rarely die for them.

---

Later that day, I found a British soldier looting a small room, stuffing silver into his coat.

He looked at me, startled, then glanced at my forehead and sneered.

"You lot are savage," he said in English, as if the word tasted good.

I did not understand the sentence fully.

I understood the contempt.

I stepped closer, slow.

The soldier stiffened, hand going to his bayonet.

Major Doyle appeared behind me and spoke sharply in English.

The soldier hesitated, then backed away, still clutching silver.

Doyle watched him go, face tight.

"They will write books about this," he said quietly. "About how we brought order."

I looked around at the smoke-stained walls, the dead bodies still uncollected in corners, the women moving like ghosts.

"Order," I repeated.

Doyle met my gaze.

"Doré served his master as you serve yours," he said. "And they killed him because he lost."

I nodded.

"His crime was losing," I replied.

The words tasted bitter.

As we walked away, the river kept flowing.

It flowed past Tipu's broken city.
It flowed past Doré's blood on stone.
It flowed past the men who would become rich from this victory.

Water does not care about empires.

Only people do.
