# Chapter 16: The North Smells of Smoke

War announces itself long before banners appear.

It arrives as refugees with cracked feet.
As merchants with anxious smiles.
As a price that rises without explanation.

It arrives as a smell.

Smoke on the wind, faint at first, then impossible to ignore.

---

Revathi sent Kesava and me north with a small patrol to inspect border villages and deliver messages.

It was not an honour.

It was work.

Work that kept us out of her hall and out of Ananthan's patience for a while.

We rode for days through green country that grew wilder as we moved north. The backwater channels narrowed. The coconut groves thinned. Jungle pressed closer to the road like men eavesdropping.

Villages became smaller.

Huts were built with quicker hands, as if people expected to abandon them.

In the first village, an old woman grabbed my sleeve when she saw my brand.

Her fingers were thin, strong.

"You," she whispered in Malayalam. "You are cursed."

I did not pull away.

"Yes," I replied.

Her eyes widened at the honesty.

She leaned closer.

"Then you will understand," she said. "The north is cursed too."

Kesava stepped in, annoyed.

"What are you talking about?" he snapped.

The old woman pointed toward the trees.

"Smoke," she said.

There was no smoke in the sky.

Only cloud.

Only green.

But I smelled it then, faint, mixed with damp leaves.

Not a kitchen fire.

A different kind of burning.

We reached a village two days later that had been raided.

Not destroyed.

Tested.

A cattle pen was empty. A shed was blackened. Two huts had scorch marks where fire had licked and then been smothered by rain.

A boy sat on a threshold staring at nothing.

Kesava dismounted and questioned the headman.

The headman spoke quickly, eyes flicking around.

"Horsemen," he said. "Not bandits. Disciplined. They took cattle and left. They fired something that screamed."

Screamed.

Kesava's jaw tightened.

He looked at me.

He did not ask what screamed.

He already knew the stories.

We rode on.

That night, we camped near a small stream and listened to insects and distant thunder.

One of our men, a young spearman, spoke softly.

"Hyder Ali," he said.

The name fell into the night like a stone into water.

Kesava stared into the fire.

"A soldier who became a ruler," he said, voice flat. "A man who drills his army like Europeans."

He spat into the fire.

"A man who uses rockets," he added.

The young spearman shivered.

I stared at the flames and felt my stomach twist.

Rockets.

I had not seen one.

I had heard men describe them in whispers, as if describing a demon.

Screaming iron.
Fire falling from the sky.

My hands tightened around the knife at my belt.

The knife felt small.

A knife is personal.

Rockets are not personal.

They kill whoever stands in their way.

The next day we met refugees on the road.

Not a camp. Not a crowd.

A line of people moving south with bundles on their heads and exhaustion in their faces.

Women with babies.
Men with nothing but walking sticks.
Children who did not play.

They saw our horses and stepped off the road quickly, eyes down.

Kesava raised his hand.

"Stop," he ordered.

He dismounted and approached an old man at the edge of the line.

"Where are you going?" Kesava asked.

The old man looked up, eyes red.

"South," he said.

"Why?" Kesava asked.

The old man swallowed.

"Because they burned the granary," he said. "Because they took my nephew. Because they said the land belongs to Mysore now."

Kesava's face went hard.

"Who said?" he demanded.

The old man pointed north with a trembling hand.

"Hyder's men," he whispered.

Kesava turned away, jaw tight.

I watched the refugees and felt something settle in my chest.

This was not a raid.

This was pressure.

Hyder was squeezing the land, making people move, making fear travel ahead of his army.

We escorted the refugees for a while, not out of kindness, out of calculation. If bandits hit them on the road, the corpses would become rumours that would reach Travancore faster than any dispatch.

On the second afternoon, a boy in the refugee line stared at my brand for a long time.

Then he asked, voice small, "What does it say?"

His mother slapped his head, hissing for silence.

The boy looked down, ashamed.

I stared at him.

In the Deccan, children had whispered the words like they were tasting poison.

Here, this boy asked like a man trying to understand a map.

"It says what I did," I replied.

The boy's eyes widened.

"Did you kill a priest?" he whispered.

I nodded.

The boy swallowed.

"Then you are not afraid," he said.

The sentence shocked me.

Not afraid.

If he knew the truth, he would know how afraid I was.

Afraid of my own hands.
Afraid of my own weakness.
Afraid of the past catching me.

I looked at the boy and spoke quietly.

"I am afraid," I said. "Every day."

The boy stared, then nodded slowly as if the answer made sense.

Fear teaches children faster than any parent can.

When we left the refugee line at the edge of Travancore's patrol range, Kesava rode in silence for a long time.

Then he spoke, voice low.

"This is only the beginning," he said.

I looked north and smelled the faint smoke again.

It was not in the air.

It was in the mind.

That night, back at the estate, Revathi listened to our report without changing expression.

When Kesava finished, she tapped her finger once on the arm of her seat.

"Hyder is a fire," she said. "Tipu will be a wind."

Kesava frowned. "Tipu?" he asked.

Revathi's eyes glittered.

"A fire's son is always worse," she said.

She looked at me.

"Do you smell it now?" she asked.

I swallowed.

"Yes," I replied.

Revathi nodded.

"Good," she said. "Then you will not be surprised when it reaches our walls."

I went to the yard that night and stood near the stables, listening to horses breathe.

The knife at my belt felt heavier than before.

Not because it had changed.

Because the world had.

The north smelled of smoke.

And Travancore, sooner or later, would have to breathe it in.
