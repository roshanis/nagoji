# Chapter 25: The Flag

Tipu did not retreat from Travancore because he ran out of courage.

He retreated because another army moved against him from the east, and even tigers must turn when the jungle catches fire.

When the British arrived, they did not come with poetry about saving kingdoms. They came with account books, cannon, and the calm certainty of men who believed the peninsula was a board game and we were pieces that could be rearranged.

They brought relief.

They also brought the taste of the future.

---

The first British soldiers I saw in this war marched into our ruined north like men walking into property they already owned.

Red coats stained dark by rain.
White faces flushed and sweating in the heat.
Sepoys in Company colours moving with practised discipline, eyes scanning the jungle as if it might owe them money.

Their cannon were hauled by oxen that struggled in mud, but the British officers did not struggle. They rode horses bred for better roads and acted as if the land should apologise for being wet.

Colonel Stuart met Kesavadas at a temporary camp near the rebuilt portion of the Lines.

He was not young. His hair was already thinning, his face lined, his uniform worn clean by use. He looked at the breach and did not pretend surprise.

"Tipu hits hard," he said in careful Portuguese, then switched to a simpler Malayalam learned from interpreters. "But he cannot be everywhere."

He looked at Kesavadas, then at me.

His gaze paused on my forehead, then moved on without comment.

That small act of discipline made me respect him more than any speech.

Captain Blackwood stood behind him, younger, sharper, eyes bright with ambition.

He watched our ruined villages with interest, not grief.

"Plenty of work for suppliers," he said in English, not bothering to lower his voice, assuming we could not understand. "And plenty of opportunity for men who know how to price desperation."

Pieter's ghost of a lesson rose in my mind, the way Europeans can smile while counting your bones.

I did not speak English, but I understood tone.

Greed has a universal language.

Kesavadas spoke politely, because politeness is what keeps allies from becoming masters too quickly.

I stood behind him and watched the British guns roll north.

If Tipu was a tide, the British were a weight.

They would push him back.

They would also sink into our soil.

---

Tipu pulled his main force out of Travancore in the early rains.

He did it fast, because he could not afford to be caught between British cannon and Travancore anger.

His rearguards burned what they could not carry.

Granaries.
Boats.
Temples that had already been looted.
Churches that had already been emptied.

They wanted the land behind them to be a wound.

We pursued anyway.

Not because pursuit would heal anything.

Because pursuit is how you tell a retreating enemy that he does not leave as a god. He leaves as a man who can bleed.

Kesava and I rode north with a mixed force, Travancore cavalry, some Company sepoys, a few British dragoons who looked uncomfortable in this green wet land.

The British moved with caution, always thinking of supply lines.

Kesava moved with anger, always thinking of insult.

I moved with something colder.

I had been hunted once.

Now I hunted.

We caught Tipu's rearguard near a stretch of the Lines that had not fully fallen, a section of rampart still standing like a broken tooth.

The Mysoreans were trying to haul a small field gun through mud, their oxen exhausted, their men snapping at each other.

They saw us and tried to form.

Too late.

Kesava raised his talwar.

"Now," he shouted.

We hit them in a rush of hooves and shouting.

The mud splashed up to my knees. My horse slipped and recovered. A Mysorean infantryman thrust a spear up at my mount's chest and I cut his arm with the knife, not cleanly, not gracefully, just enough to make him drop the shaft and scream.

In the chaos, my eyes caught on something that did not belong in mud.

Green silk, bright against brown.

A standard.

The standard bearer was young, face tight with fear and pride, gripping the pole as if holding it upright could hold the world upright.

The cloth snapped in wind, and on it, stitched in gold and black, was the tiger.

Snarling.
Striding.
A beast that Tipu had made into an empire's symbol.

My stomach tightened.

This flag had flown over burned churches and smashed temples.
It had flown over forced marches.
It had flown over the breach that killed Caspar.

The standard bearer saw me and tried to turn his horse, keeping the flag away from my hands.

I spurred.

The distance closed fast, hooves pounding, breath harsh in my throat.

He raised his sword.

I did not give him time to use it.

I drove my knife into his shoulder, felt it bite through cloth and flesh, then yanked it free and grabbed the pole with my left hand.

The boy screamed and fell sideways, still clutching the wood.

For a heartbeat we wrestled, his dying strength clinging to symbol.

Then Kesava's horse slammed into his mount and the standard bearer went down into the mud, the flag folding over him like a shroud.

I tore the pole free.

The cloth whipped around my face, wet, heavy, smelling of smoke and sweat and something sharp like old blood.

I held it upright without thinking, because a soldier understands flags the way a priest understands icons.

Men saw it and shouted.

Travancore soldiers shouted in triumph.
Sepoys shouted because shouting is how you convince yourself you are winning.

The Mysoreans saw the tiger go into our hands and something broke in them.

They fled.

We chased only far enough to make the retreat a wound, then pulled back, because discipline is the difference between victory and ambush.

---

When we rode back toward the Lines with the captured flag, rain began again, fine and steady.

Kesava rode beside me, breathing hard, blood on his sleeve.

He glanced at the green silk.

"That will make stories," he said.

I looked at the tiger stitched in thread, mouth open forever in a snarl that could not bite.

"Yes," I replied.

Kesava grinned, fierce.

"Let Tipu hear of it," he said. "Let him know his god can be grabbed by a man from the Deccan with a brand on his face."

The words should have satisfied me.

Instead I felt only a strange hollowness.

The flag was heavy in my hand.

Not because of the cloth.

Because of what it had witnessed.

We raised it on a section of the reclaimed rampart as a signal.

Travancore still stood.

Tipu could retreat, but he could not pretend he had been victorious here.

As the green silk snapped above the wall, I thought of the refugees who had walked south believing walls meant safety.

Walls do not mean safety.

Walls only mean you have chosen where you will bleed.
