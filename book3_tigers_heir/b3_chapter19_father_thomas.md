# Chapter 19: Father Thomas

The first dead refugee we buried in Travancore was a girl with a braid still neat.

She could not have been more than twelve.

Her feet were swollen, her lips cracked, her skin hot with fever even after she stopped breathing. Her mother sat beside the body and combed the braid again and again, as if order could be forced back into a child by repeating a familiar gesture.

Kesava told me to move the body before the camp saw it and began to panic.

He was not cruel.

He was practical.

Panic kills more than fever.

I went to the edge of the camp with two men and dug into damp ground with spades borrowed from farmers. The earth was heavy, dark, clinging. Kerala soil holds water the way grief holds memory.

When we returned for the body, the mother was still combing.

An old priest stood behind her.

He was small and thin, his cassock patched, his beard white and wiry. A cross hung at his chest, and his hands were stained with earth as if he had already been digging graves before we asked.

He watched me approach.

He did not look at my uniform first.
He looked at my forehead.

BRAHMIN-KILLER.

He read it without moving his lips, then lifted his eyes to mine.

I expected disgust.
I expected fear.
I expected the flinch that always came after recognition.

Instead he said, in Malayalam softened by age, "You will carry her gently."

It was not a request.

It was instruction.

I found myself nodding.

We lifted the girl's body onto a cloth and carried her through the camp. People turned to watch, and their faces tightened, as if seeing a dead child made the road behind them real again.

The priest walked beside me, murmuring a prayer in a language I did not know. The syllables sounded old, older than Portuguese, older than Dutch. Like something that had washed up on this coast and decided to survive.

At the grave, he stopped.

He looked at the mother.

"We will not pretend," he said quietly. "We will not say God wanted this. We will say the world is cruel and we will ask God to meet her in a place that is not."

The mother made a sound that was not a sob. It was too deep for that.

The priest glanced at me again.

"You," he said. "Help me lower her."

I did.

When the first clods of earth hit the cloth, the sound was dull and final.

The priest made the sign of the cross.

Then, to my shock, he placed his palm on the ground above the grave and whispered something that sounded like blessing.

I stared at his hand, brown and veined, fingers stained with soil.

I had killed a priest once.

I had never touched a priest since.

Now one stood beside me and used me like a tool.

---

After the burial, he found me washing mud from my hands at the water pots.

Mariam stood nearby, speaking to Kesavadas's clerk in rapid Malayalam, translating complaints into lists. She glanced at the priest and dipped her head in respect.

"Father," she said.

So this was the priest the refugees had been following.

He looked at her with something like affection, then looked back at me.

"You are the one with the scar," he said, as if describing a burn, not a crime.

The words tightened my stomach.

"Yes," I replied.

"And you are the one who digs," he added.

It was almost a compliment.

Mariam's mouth twitched, the ghost of a smile.

The priest turned slightly and addressed me in a slower Malayalam, the way one speaks to a man who is not fully of this coast.

"My name is Thomas," he said. "Father Thomas, if titles comfort you."

"They do not," I replied.

"Good," he said. "Then we can speak plainly."

He nodded toward the camp.

"These people are tired," he said. "They will become angry. They will become sick. They will fight over food because food is the only power they have left."

He looked at my forehead again.

"You have fought," he said, statement not question.

"Yes," I replied.

"Then you know this," he said. "A crowd can be a weapon. And a weapon can turn in the hand."

His eyes were not accusing.

They were warning.

I found myself answering with the truth.

"I know," I said. "I have been hunted by crowds."

Father Thomas nodded, satisfied.

"Then you understand refugees better than most kings do," he said. "Kings think people are loyal. Refugees know loyalty is hunger with a story attached."

He said it the way a priest says scripture.

Thomman Mappila approached then, wiping sweat from his forehead with the edge of his cloth.

"Father," Thomman greeted, then looked at me. "And the soldier."

Father Thomas made a small gesture with his hand.

"This is Balan Pillai," he said.

The name still sounded like clothing I had not fully worn in.

Father Thomas continued, "He is cursed, but he works."

Thomman raised his eyebrows.

"Cursed men are useful," he said. "They do not pretend the world is clean."

Mariam shot Thomman a look.

"Do not speak like that," she said. "You make pain into a proverb."

Thomman shrugged, unoffended. "Pain pays for pepper," he replied, and walked off to shout at porters.

Father Thomas watched him go.

"He is not wrong," he said quietly. "He is only unkind in the way merchants are."

Then he looked at me again.

"Why do you stay here?" he asked.

The question landed harder than it should have.

I could have said duty.
I could have said the king.
I could have said I had nowhere else to go.

All of those were true.

None of them were enough.

I wiped my hands on my cloth slowly.

"Because my father died so I could run," I said. "And I am tired of running."

Father Thomas studied me.

Then he said, almost gently, "And do you think staying makes you forgiven?"

The words scraped.

I felt heat rise under the scar tissue, as if the brand still burned.

"No," I said. "I do not believe in forgiveness."

Father Thomas nodded as if hearing something familiar.

"Good," he said. "Forgiveness is cheap when it is offered by men who never paid your price."

He stepped closer, and for the first time I smelled incense on him, faint, mixed with sweat.

"Listen to me," he said, voice low. "God does not ask which army you rode with. He asks what you did when you dismounted."

I stared at him.

It was a strange thing to hear from a priest, and stranger still from a priest speaking to a man branded for killing one.

I waited for him to add an accusation.

He did not.

He simply looked past me, toward the camp, toward the children with fever, toward the men whose eyes had gone flat.

"If you want to build something that survives," he continued, "then you do not begin by asking for clean hands. You begin by feeding the hungry and keeping the strong from preying on the weak."

He nodded toward Mariam.

"She is doing that," he said. "Use her well. Do not make her beg for respect."

Mariam pretended not to hear, but her shoulders shifted slightly.

Father Thomas turned his gaze back to my forehead.

Then, without flinching, he reached up and touched the edge of the scar tissue with two fingers.

The contact made my whole body stiffen.

I did not pull away.

Father Thomas's touch was not blessing.

It was examination, like a doctor testing whether a wound has healed.

"Fire leaves marks," he said quietly. "Sometimes the mark is the point."

He lowered his hand.

"Do you still crave the black paste?" he asked.

The question startled me.

Mariam's eyes snapped to my face.

I realised in that moment that she did not know the full shape of my ruin. She knew the brand. She did not know the hunger behind it.

I swallowed.

"Yes," I admitted. "Some days."

Father Thomas nodded as if that was expected.

"Then stay away from it," he said. "Not because it is sin. Because you are already a man who knows what weakness costs. Do not make your weakness into other people's grave."

The words were harsh.

They were also true.

He stepped back, leaving me with the sting of honesty.

Then he turned to Mariam.

"Come," he said. "We have more dead to bury before the sun takes them."

Mariam nodded and followed him without looking at me.

I watched them walk through the camp, a priest and a woman carrying grief like work.

For the first time in a long time, I felt something close to reverence.

Not for gods.

For people who kept moving when the world tried to stop them.
