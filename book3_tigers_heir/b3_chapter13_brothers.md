# Chapter 13: Brothers

Kesava Pillai became my brother in the only way men like us become brothers.

Not with vows.

Not with shared meals.

With blood and breath and a moment when you realise the man beside you is the difference between living and dying.

It happened on a road north of the estate, in scrub country where the jungle begins to thicken and the air tastes of iron.

We were riding patrol, six horsemen, ordered to investigate reports of raiders taking cattle from villages near the border.

Raiders are usually bandits.

Sometimes raiders are scouts.

Sometimes they are a kingdom's fingers testing how soft you are.

We did not know which this was until we saw them.

---

The village was quiet when we arrived.

Too quiet.

Huts stood with doors open. A pot lay on its side in the mud, rice spilled, already pecked by birds. A goat bleated from somewhere unseen, a thin desperate sound.

Kesava raised his hand and we halted.

He slid off his horse and crouched, fingers touching the ground.

He looked up at me.

"Tracks," he said.

His voice was calm.

It was the calm of a man who has learned that panic is contagious.

He pointed at the mud near a hut.

Hoof prints.

Not local.

The pattern was too neat, the spacing too controlled.

These were not village ponies driven by hungry thieves.

These were cavalry mounts.

Kesava's eyes narrowed.

"Mysore," he muttered.

The word made my stomach tighten.

I had heard it spoken in court like a distant disease.

Here it sat in mud and silence and spilled rice.

Kesava signaled two men to circle left and two right.

He looked at me.

"With me," he ordered.

It was the first time he had said it without contempt.

We moved through the huts toward the back of the village where a narrow path led into scrub.

A woman lay on the ground near the path, face turned away, cloth torn.

Kesava's jaw tightened.

He did not stop.

In war, stopping can kill the living.

We followed the path.

The scrub thickened.

Then a matchlock fired.

The sound cracked through the air.

The ball struck a tree trunk near Kesava's head and buried itself in wood with a dull thud.

Kesava dropped instantly, body moving before thought.

I dropped too.

Another shot cracked.

One of our men behind us screamed and fell.

Ambush.

Not bandits.

Scouts with discipline.

Kesava hissed.

"Back," he whispered. "Draw them out."

He was trying to pull us out of the kill zone.

The kill zone did not want to let us go.

Two riders burst out of the scrub on our left, swords raised.

Kesava rolled and came up with his spear.

The first rider swung down.

Kesava parried, the spear shaft vibrating with impact.

The second rider aimed for Kesava's ribs.

I did not think.

I lunged and drove my spear into the second rider's horse, low in the chest.

The horse screamed and collapsed, throwing the rider into the mud.

The rider tried to rise.

Kesava's spear point flashed and went into the man's throat.

Blood bubbled.

Kesava's face was still.

No triumph.

Only necessity.

The first rider wheeled away, startled by the horse collapse, and shouted something in a tongue I did not know.

More movement in the scrub.

Three more riders, then four, appearing and disappearing like ghosts in green.

Kesava signaled our men to form a loose line, not a cluster.

"Spread," he shouted. "Do not bunch."

I understood without understanding.

Even I had learned that neatness is death when fire falls from the sky.

We spread.

The Mysore scouts fired matchlocks again, aiming at the places men would have stood if we had been foolish.

They were learning.

So were we.

Kesava shouted another order, and our men fired back, not in volley, in controlled individual shots.

One Mysorean rider toppled off his horse and disappeared into scrub.

Then the scouts charged.

Close work.

Steel and hooves and breath.

The world narrowed to the sound of my own blood in my ears and the weight of the spear in my hands.

I saw a rider's sword flash toward my face.

I raised the spear shaft and felt the blade bite into wood.

The impact numbed my fingers.

I shoved forward and drove the spear point into the rider's shoulder.

He screamed and fell sideways, dragged by his own horse.

Another rider came for me.

Kesava cut across and took the rider's horse by the bridle, yanking it off line.

The rider's sword missed me and struck air.

I drove my spear into the rider's belly.

He folded over the point and made a wet choking sound.

When I yanked the spear back, blood sprayed warm on my hands.

My stomach turned.

I kept moving anyway.

Kesava fought like a man who had never been an addict, never been a thief, never been a stain. His motions were clean. His breath controlled. He did not waste effort.

He was everything I was not.

And still, he was fighting beside me.

That was the strange truth of battle.

It does not care who you were.

It cares whether your hands obey you now.

Our men on the flanks surged in, the two riders Kesava had sent earlier returning at the right moment, spears lowered.

The Mysore scouts hesitated.

Hesitation is death.

One of our riders caught a Mysorean in the back with a spear thrust and the man tumbled off his saddle.

The remaining scouts pulled away into the scrub, retreating fast, disciplined even in withdrawal.

They did not run like bandits.

They withdrew like men who expected to return.

Silence fell again, broken by heavy breathing and the moan of a wounded horse.

Kesava stood in the mud, chest rising and falling.

He looked at the dead in the scrub and then at our fallen man, the one shot in the ambush.

The man still breathed, shallow. Blood seeped from his side.

Kesava knelt and pressed cloth to the wound with practised hands.

He looked up at me.

"Help," he snapped.

No insult.

No contempt.

Only command.

I knelt and pressed my hand harder.

The blood was warm.

The wounded man whimpered.

Kesava's eyes stayed on the man's face.

"Do not die," he muttered, as if the words could hold the life in.

Then Kesava looked at me again.

The gaze was different now.

Not contempt.

Not hatred.

Recognition.

"You saved me," he said quietly.

I swallowed.

"I saved myself," I replied, and the sentence came out rough.

Kesava's mouth twitched.

"Yes," he said. "That too."

He rose, wiping blood on his cloth.

He looked north, toward scrub that had swallowed the scouts.

"They are testing us," he said.

I nodded.

Kesava's gaze flicked to my brand.

For a heartbeat, I expected the old contempt to return.

It did not.

"Do you know why my grandfather trains you?" he asked suddenly.

My tongue felt thick in my mouth.

"Because Revathi forced him," I said.

Kesava shook his head slightly.

"He hates being forced," he said. "He would rather burn the house down."

Kesava's voice lowered.

"He trains you because he thinks you can hold," he said.

Hold.

The word sounded like a prayer.

Kesava looked back at the wounded man.

"If you break," he said, "men will die."

I felt the sentence settle in my chest like weight.

"Then I will not break," I said.

Kesava stared at me for a long moment.

Then he nodded.

We lifted the wounded man onto a horse and rode back toward the estate.

The sky was darkening again.

Rain was coming.

Mysore scouts were in the scrub behind us, carrying their own report.

And beside me rode Kesava, no longer looking through me.

In Travancore, that was as close to brotherhood as a man like me could hope to earn.
