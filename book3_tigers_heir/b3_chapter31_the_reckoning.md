# Chapter 31: The Reckoning

I had imagined the moment with the Deshmukh for years.

In some versions, he found me and cut me down like the dog he had always believed I was.

In others, I killed him and felt nothing, because men like me are supposed to be empty.

The truth was quieter.

The truth was older.

The truth arrived not with swords drawn but with two men standing amid ruins and admitting what time cannot erase.

---

The fort stank in the days after the assault.

Smoke still rose from buildings that had burned slowly, stubbornly, refusing to die even when victory had moved on. Corpses lay in corners where no one wanted to touch them. Flies gathered in black clusters.

The allied camp tried to organise looting into legality.

Officers issued receipts for stolen goods.
Clerks wrote lists.
Men pretended theft becomes honour if you record it.

I walked the streets once, alone, and regretted it.

A woman sat on a doorstep, rocking, eyes blank, whispering a prayer in a language I did not know.

No one helped her.

In war, civilians become scenery.

I turned away and found a quieter lane near the palace walls, where the stone was still warm from fire.

That was where the Deshmukh found me.

I heard hooves first, slow.

Then the sound of dismounting.

I turned and saw him standing in the mouth of the lane, two of his men behind him.

He looked smaller than he had in my memory.

Not weak.

Compressed by age.

His hair was grey.
His face lined.
His eyes still hard.

Those eyes had burned me long before any hot iron.

He stared at my forehead.

I did not cover it.

Covering is for men who still believe shame can be hidden.

"Bhalerao," he said.

Hearing my name in his mouth felt like being pulled backward through time.

I did not answer.

He stepped closer, boots crunching on debris.

"You are not dead," he said, voice flat.

"No," I replied.

One of his men shifted, hand on sword hilt.

The Deshmukh lifted a hand, stopping him.

He looked past my face for a moment, taking in the ruined fort, the smoke, the stench.

"This is where the tiger died," he said.

"Yes," I replied.

He nodded slowly, as if confirming a map.

"And this is where my hunt ends," he added.

The words should have relieved me.

They did not.

Relief is for men who believe an ending cleans what came before.

The Deshmukh stepped close enough that I could smell him.

Sweat.
Dust.
Old tobacco.

The smell of a man who had lived long enough to watch his anger turn into habit.

"You killed my son," he said, calmly, as if stating the weather.

I nodded.

"Yes."

He continued, voice steady.

"You killed a priest."

"Yes."

"Your father died for your sins."

The words struck harder than any blade.

My throat tightened.

I forced the truth out, because lies were pointless now.

"Yes," I said. "He did."

The Deshmukh's eyes narrowed.

For a moment I saw pain under the hardness, raw as exposed flesh.

"My son's wife was with child," he said. "A boy. Born after your knife. He grew up with my hatred as his inheritance."

I stared at him.

The boy would be a man now.

I had not thought of that.

That was another crime.

Not only death.

Time.

The Deshmukh's jaw worked as if chewing something bitter.

"I chased you across the Deccan," he said. "I spent gold that should have fed villages. I sent men to die for vengeance. I became smaller because I would not stop."

He looked at the ruins again, then back at me.

"And you," he said, contempt and disbelief mixed. "You became a soldier. A husband. A man with a house. You built a life."

His voice sharpened on the last words.

As if building was an insult to the dead.

I did not defend myself.

Defence is for men who think they deserve it.

"Yes," I said. "I did."

The Deshmukh stared at me for a long moment.

Then he said, quietly, "Do you think that makes you forgiven?"

The question was a blade, but I had learned how to stand still when blades are offered.

"No," I replied. "I do not think forgiveness exists."

His eyes flicked, a small movement, as if that answer surprised him.

"Good," he said, almost softly. "Then at least you are not a liar."

He stepped closer and raised a hand.

For an instant my body tensed, expecting violence.

He did not strike me.

He touched the scar on my forehead with one finger, just at the edge of the letters.

The contact burned, not with pain, but with memory.

"They marked you," he said.

"Yes."

"It was not enough," he replied.

The sentence held everything.

His son's death.
The priest's blood.
My father's sacrifice.
The years of pursuit.

Nothing had been enough.

He lowered his hand.

"I do not forgive," he said. "I will never forgive."

I nodded.

The Deshmukh exhaled slowly, and in that breath I heard fatigue.

"But I am done hunting," he finished.

The words fell between us like the end of a long sentence.

One of his men shifted again, uncomfortable, as if uncertain what to do when hatred stops being active.

The Deshmukh looked at his man and said, "We leave."

Then he looked at me one last time.

"Live with it," he said.

I did not answer.

There was no answer.

He turned and walked away through the ruin, his men following.

I watched his back until the smoke swallowed him.

When he was gone, the lane felt emptier than before, as if even hatred had been a kind of company.

I leaned against the wall and closed my eyes.

The brand throbbed.

Not from fresh fire.

From old fire that never fully cools.

The chase was over.

The weight was not.
