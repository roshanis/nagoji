# Chapter 24: The Tiger at Alleppey

I had always thought a king was something you could not touch.

In the Deccan, kings were distant. Names on coins. Men behind curtains. Even when you fought for them, you fought for their banner, not their flesh.

In Travancore, the king was closer, but still protected by ritual and distance. You prostrated. You spoke through ministers. You kept your eyes down.

Then Tipu's cavalry found Dharma Raja on the road near Alleppey, and the distance collapsed into blood and mud.

---

We had been retreating for days, falling back from village to village, turning bridges into fires, turning roads into choke points, trying to slow an army that moved like a tide.

The land changed as we moved south.

The jungle thinned.
The water widened.
The air became heavier, salted by the sea.

The backwaters began to appear beside the road, broad channels with still surfaces that reflected the sky like polished metal. Boats slid along them, quiet, carrying rice, coconuts, frightened families, whatever could be moved before Mysore hands reached it.

Kesavadas had advised the king to move closer to the water.

Not because he wanted to flee.

Because the water offered options.

If Tipu broke through completely, the king could be moved by boat, hidden among the channels like a fish among reeds.

Kings survive by keeping their bodies mobile.

That morning, Kesava and I were two miles behind the royal party, riding hard, managing the rearguard, dealing with stragglers and panic.

We heard the fighting before we saw it.

Not cannon.

Close fighting.

Horses screaming.
Men shouting in Malayalam.
Steel ringing.

Kesava's head snapped up.

"Forward," he barked, and we spurred.

The road narrowed between water and coconut grove. The mud was deep, churned by carts. Our horses struggled, hooves sinking and pulling free with wet sucking sounds.

We rounded a bend and saw the royal escort scattered.

Not in formation.

Scattered like startled birds.

Tipu's forward cavalry had caught them.

They were not a full Mysorean army.

They were a hunting party, perhaps a hundred riders, light and fast, men who had ridden ahead of the main force to find the king and end the war with one cut.

Their uniforms were dark, their turbans tight, their faces streaked with sweat. Some carried lances. Some carried sabers. One man held a rocket tube like a staff, ready to fire into the chaos.

Travancore guards fought desperately around a palanquin that had been abandoned in the mud.

The king was not in it.

He was on horseback, because there had been no time for dignity.

Dharma Raja's horse was a fine animal, but the king sat it like a scholar forced onto a battlefield. His posture was rigid. His hands were too tight on the reins.

An officer rode beside him, shouting, trying to turn the horse toward the water.

A Mysorean rider cut in and slashed.

The officer fell.

Dharma Raja's horse reared, eyes rolling.

The king did not fall.

That, in that moment, earned my respect more than any prayer.

"To the king," Kesava shouted.

We drove our horses into the melee.

There was no room for a beautiful charge.

There was only the brutal work of forcing bodies apart.

I cut at a lance shaft, hacked at a man's wrist, felt steel bite into steel with a shock that ran up my arm.

Kesava's talwar flashed.

He rode like a man who had forgotten fear, his blade moving in clean arcs, cutting space open.

A Mysorean rider lunged at me, saber raised.

I leaned low, ducked the swing, and drove my knife up under his ribs.

His breath left him in a wet gasp.

He slid off his saddle and vanished into mud.

I did not look down.

Looking down is how you die.

We reached the king.

Dharma Raja's eyes were wide, but his face was strangely calm, as if his mind had stepped away from panic and into a cold place where observation lives.

He saw my forehead.

I saw him register the letters without time to react.

Then another Mysorean rider came in fast, aiming not at me, not at Kesava, but at the king's exposed side.

I threw my horse between them.

The saber hit my shoulder.

Pain exploded, bright and immediate.

For a heartbeat, the world narrowed to that one line of fire across flesh.

Then training took over.

I grabbed the rider's wrist, yanked him close, and drove my knife into his throat.

Blood sprayed warm.

His eyes widened in surprise, as if he had expected the king to be easier prey than a branded cavalryman.

He toppled backward and fell.

My shoulder burned.

I tasted iron in my mouth.

I did not let my face show it.

The king stared at me.

"You are hurt," he said, voice thin.

"Not yet," I lied.

Kesava barked orders to the remaining guards.

"Circle," he shouted. "Close. Close."

We formed a ring around Dharma Raja, horses pressed flank to flank, spears angled outward, blades ready.

Mysorean cavalry hit the ring and bounced off.

Horses screamed when they collided.

Men cursed.

One rider tried to push through anyway and was dragged down and trampled.

The road was too narrow for Tipu's men to use their numbers properly.

That was our only advantage.

Behind us, the water lay open.

Boats waited at a small landing, fishermen and palace servants mixed together in frantic labour.

"To the boats," Kesava ordered.

We began to move, the ring shifting as a unit, step by brutal step, like men carrying a heavy load through a crowd.

The Mysoreans followed, snapping at the edges.

One fired a rocket.

The screaming iron streaked past my head and slammed into a coconut trunk, exploding into sparks and smoke.

The smell of burnt fibre filled the air.

The horses shied.

The ring wavered.

"Hold," I shouted, voice raw, and forced my horse forward, shoulder screaming.

We reached the landing.

Servants grabbed at the king, trying to pull him off his horse.

Dharma Raja resisted, pride flaring even now.

"I can walk," he snapped.

Kesava seized his arm.

"Then walk," he replied. "But walk into a boat, Your Highness."

The king stumbled, face tightening with pain.

Only then did I see the blood on his side, a thin line that darkened his cloth.

He had been cut too.

Even kings bleed.

We shoved him into the boat.

The boat rocked, water slapping the sides.

Mysorean cavalry reached the landing and tried to follow.

We met them at the edge, blades flashing.

A man grabbed my wounded shoulder and pain flared so hard I nearly blacked out.

I drove my elbow into his face and heard cartilage crack.

He fell into the water with a splash and disappeared among reeds.

Kesava kicked another rider's horse in the flank, sending it sideways into the channel.

Horse and man went in together, thrashing.

The canal was not deep enough to drown quickly.

It was deep enough to trap.

The boat pushed off.

Men on the bank shoved with poles.

The king sat hunched, hand pressed to his side, jaw clenched.

He looked at me.

"Who are you?" he asked, voice quiet.

It was the first time he had spoken to me directly like a man, not through ceremony.

I stood in the shallow water, knife in hand, blood dripping from my sleeve, and my brand exposed to the world.

"Bhalerao," I said.

The king's eyes flicked to my forehead again.

Then, to my surprise, he nodded.

"Bhalerao," he repeated, as if fixing the name into memory. "You saved my life."

I wanted to say I was only paying debts.

My father's debt.
Travancore's debt.
My own debt to the dead priest whose blood I could not wash away.

Instead I said, "It is my duty."

Dharma Raja's mouth tightened.

"Duty," he murmured. "Yes. That is what keeps kingdoms from becoming stories."

The boat slid into the channel, reeds closing around it, hiding it from the road.

On the bank, Tipu's men shouted in fury, firing muskets uselessly into water and green.

Their rage sounded like frustration more than triumph.

They had come for the king and had found only blood and escape.

As the boat carried Dharma Raja away through the backwaters, I stood on the muddy bank with my men and watched the channel swallow him.

My shoulder throbbed.
My hand shook slightly.

Kesava touched my arm once, quick.

"You did well," he said.

It was the closest thing to tenderness he would ever offer.

I looked north, toward smoke, toward the broken Lines, toward an army that believed it could take the sea.

Then I looked at the water, at the king vanishing into reeds like a rumour.

For the first time since the temple stones, I felt a strange, bitter pride.

Not pride in killing.

Pride in standing in the way so someone else could live.
