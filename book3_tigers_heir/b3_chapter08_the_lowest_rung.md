# Chapter 8: The Lowest Rung

They put me in the stables as if trying to remind me that I was not a man.

Not yet.

The stable floor was packed earth slick with old urine. The air smelled of horse sweat and dung and wet hay. Rats moved in the corners, bold. A horse shifted in its stall and the sound of its hooves on wood was louder than any prayer.

The stable boys looked at my forehead and then looked away quickly, as if the brand might infect them.

One boy, not old enough to shave, whispered the words under his breath as if tasting them.

"Brahmin-killer."

The whisper was not accusation.

It was fascination.

Children are always fascinated by monsters.

That night, lying on a thin mat beside the stalls, I listened to the horses breathe and tried not to think about opium.

Opium is patient. It does not shout. It waits.

It told me, softly, that the stable was a kind of punishment and that punishment should be eased.

It told me that my father was dead anyway, so why should I suffer for his sacrifice.

It told me that the brand on my forehead would never go away, so why pretend redemption mattered.

I lay in the dark and stared at the stable beams until my eyes ached.

Then I forced my mind to a different place.

My father's voice.

Run.

Do not look back.

He had died so I could live.

If I ran back to the paste, I would be killing him again.

So I breathed through the craving, one breath at a time, until exhaustion dragged me under.

---

Morning in the stables begins before sunrise.

The horses need water.
The dung needs clearing.
The tack needs cleaning.

Pride has no place in a stable.

The stable master was an old man named Kannan with arms like rope and eyes like stones.

He looked at me once, taking in the brand, the hollow cheeks, the way my hands shook slightly even without opium.

"You have a strong back?" he asked in Malayalam.

"Yes," I replied, forcing the word out.

Kannan spat.

"We will see," he said.

He handed me a basket and pointed at the dung.

"Clean," he ordered.

No introduction.
No kindness.

Just work.

I bent and began to shovel dung with my bare hands.

The smell hit hard. Heat rose from the pile. Flies swarmed.

I gagged once and forced it down.

If I had been in the Deccan, I would have hit someone for making me do this.

Here, hitting someone would have ended my chance before it began.

Kannan watched for a while, then walked away without a word.

The stable boys laughed quietly.

One threw a pebble that hit my shoulder.

"Priest-killer," he whispered.

I kept working.

My hands moved.

My mind did not.

If I allowed my mind to move, it would move toward rage.

Rage would move toward murder.

So I became hands.

Hands doing work.

---

By midday, my fingers were raw.

The brand on my forehead had dried and cracked at the edges. When sweat ran into it, it stung.

Kannan gave me a clay cup of water and watched me drink as if assessing whether I deserved hydration.

Then he pointed toward a stall where a restless horse was pawing at the ground.

"That one," he said. "The mare. She bites."

I looked at the mare.

She was small but muscular, ears pinned, eyes rolling.

"She does not like strangers," Kannan added, tone flat. "Neither do we."

He walked away.

I approached the mare slowly, palm open, voice low.

Horses understand calm better than they understand words.

The mare snorted, head tossing.

I spoke to her anyway, not in Malayalam, not in Marathi, in the nonsense sounds my father used to make when he wanted a horse to trust him.

Soft clicks.
Low hums.

The mare's ears shifted slightly.

I stepped closer, careful, and reached for the water bucket.

Her teeth snapped at the air, missing my wrist by a finger width.

My heart hammered.

Old instinct rose.

Strike.

Knife.

But there was no knife here. There was only a horse and a bucket and a stable full of watching eyes.

I held still.

The mare snorted again, then lowered her head slightly.

I slid the bucket into place and stepped back.

The mare drank, eyes still wary.

One of the stable boys stared at me with surprise.

He had expected blood.

So had I.

---

The first time I saw Kesava Pillai, I was carrying a sack of feed across the courtyard.

He rode in with two other young men, all of them mounted, all of them dressed like the sons of men who had never known hunger. Their cloth was clean. Their belts were decorated. Their hair was oiled. Their eyes were sharp.

Kesava sat his horse as if he had been born on a saddle.

He saw me and slowed.

His gaze went to my forehead.

The brand was uncovered. Kannan had ordered it uncovered.

"Let everyone see what you are," he had said. "It will make you honest."

Kesava's mouth tightened.

"What is this?" he asked in Malayalam, as if I were a stray animal that had wandered into the yard.

One of the other young men laughed.

"Revathi brought a monster," he said.

Kesava's eyes stayed on my face.

"A Brahmin-killer," he said, and the words came out clean, without fear, without fascination. Only contempt.

I shifted the feed sack on my shoulder and kept walking.

Kesava's horse stepped into my path.

The animal was well trained, obedient. It blocked me neatly.

Kesava looked down at me.

"Do you know where you are?" he asked.

His voice was calm.

That calmness was a kind of cruelty.

"In a stable," I replied in Marathi-tinged Malayalam. "With horses."

One of his friends laughed again.

Kesava's eyes narrowed.

"This is my grandfather's house," he said. "My grandmother's house. You are a stain on their floor."

My chest tightened.

The words were true.

The truth still stung.

"Then do not look at me," I said.

The sentence came out before I could stop it.

The yard went quiet.

Even the stable boys stopped laughing.

Kesava's gaze sharpened.

He swung off his horse in one smooth motion and stepped close.

He was not tall, but he was solid, muscle under cloth, a man built by training.

"You have courage," he said softly. "Or stupidity. It is difficult to tell the difference in a man like you."

He reached up and, with two fingers, touched the edge of my brand.

Pain flared.

I jerked back.

My hands clenched.

For a heartbeat, the old me rose.

The opium man.
The temple robber.
The knife in the dark.

I could have killed him with my bare hands if I chose to.

That thought arrived with terrifying ease.

Kesava saw the flicker in my eyes and smiled slightly.

He wanted me to strike.

He wanted to see the monster prove itself.

My father's voice rose in my mind again, not as command, as memory of consequence.

He had died because I could not control my hands.

I forced my fingers open.

I shifted the feed sack and stepped around Kesava's horse, careful, controlled.

Kesava watched me pass.

"You will break," he said quietly, as if making a prediction about weather. "Men like you always do."

I did not look back.

If I looked back, I might have done what he wanted.

I carried the feed into the stable and dumped it into the troughs with more force than necessary.

The horses lifted their heads, startled.

Kannan appeared in the doorway.

He looked at my face.

"That one?" he asked, meaning Kesava.

I nodded.

Kannan spat.

"He thinks he is a man because his blood is clean," he said. "He will learn."

I stared at him, surprised.

Kannan shrugged.

"This house makes boys into men," he said. "It made Ananthan. It will make him. It might even make you."

Might.

The word was not comfort.

It was a challenge.

That night, lying beside the stalls, my hands throbbing, my stomach hollow with withdrawal, I listened to the horses breathe and thought of Kesava's fingers on my brand.

He wanted me to break.

Everyone did.

It would make their world simpler.

I closed my eyes and forced myself to imagine something harder.

Not breaking.

Becoming useful.

Becoming, somehow, a man who could carry the knife without using it.
