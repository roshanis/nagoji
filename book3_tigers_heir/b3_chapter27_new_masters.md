# Chapter 27: New Masters

After the treaty, Travancore tried to pretend the world could go back to what it had been.

The priests returned to arguing about ritual.
The merchants returned to haggling over pepper.
The farmers returned to coaxing rice from flooded fields.

But the war had changed the air.

It was quieter now, yes.

It was also watched.

The British did not leave when the fighting stopped. They only changed the shape of their presence, from cannon to contracts.

---

Captain Blackwood came to Travancore three months after Seringapatam.

He arrived with letters and a smile and boots too clean for our roads. Behind him came clerks, sepoys, and a train of porters carrying boxes that looked like gifts until you remembered that gifts from powerful men always have strings.

Kesavadas received him at court with the same controlled politeness he used on kings.

I stood behind Kesavadas with Kesava and watched the British officer bow, straighten, and look around the hall as if assessing what could be moved.

Blackwood's eyes lingered on the temple lamps, on the carved pillars, on the guards' spears.

Then his gaze found my forehead and paused.

For an instant the polite mask slipped and I saw what he saw.

A criminal in uniform.
A weapon with an ugly history.

Then the mask returned.

"Captain Blackwood," he said in Portuguese, smooth. "You have travelled far."

He spoke as if he were doing us a favour by arriving.

"Travancore is worth the travel," Kesavadas replied, equally smooth. "It pays its debts."

The word debts hung in the air like incense.

Blackwood smiled wider.

"That is exactly why we are friends," he said.

Friends.

He used the word the way a butcher uses fat, generously, without understanding that the animal hears.

---

The demands came with the smile.

More supplies for Company troops.
Better roads for Company carts.
Guarantees about pepper exports.

And, behind all of it, the unspoken assumption that a kingdom that had been saved by British guns now belonged to British influence.

Kesavadas argued in the language of treaties.

Blackwood argued in the language of inevitability.

At one point, Blackwood gestured toward the north as if Tipu were still there.

"We kept the tiger off your throat," he said. "Surely you understand the value of continued protection."

Kesavadas replied calmly, "Protection is not free."

Blackwood laughed.

"Nothing is free," he said, as if revealing a profound truth.

Kesava leaned toward me and muttered, "He thinks we are children who have just discovered hunger."

I watched Blackwood's hands.

They were clean.
Soft.
The hands of a man who kills by signing.

In the Deccan, I had feared men with swords.

Now I began to fear men with paper.

At home, Mariam listened to my report of the meeting while she ground spices with a stone that made a steady, patient sound.

The house smelled of curry leaves and smoke from the kitchen fire.

A child cried from the inner room.

Our son, not yet five, angry because the world refused to obey him.

Mariam did not go to him immediately. She kept grinding, letting the child cry itself tired.

"You are tense," she said without looking up.

I flexed my wounded shoulder. The saber cut from Alleppey still ached when rain came.

"Blackwood was here," I replied.

Mariam's grinding slowed.

"The one with the smile," she said.

"Yes."

She resumed grinding, harder now, as if punishing the stone.

"He wants more than pepper," she said.

It was not a question.

"He wants everything," I replied.

Mariam set the stone down and wiped her hands on her cloth.

She looked at my forehead.

Then at my eyes.

"You used to think the brand was the worst thing that could be written on a man," she said quietly.

I did not answer.

"Now you see," she continued, "there are marks you cannot burn out of skin because they are burned into law."

Our son cried louder.

Mariam rose and went to him.

I heard her voice from the inner room, low, steady, soothing.

The crying softened, then stopped.

I sat at the doorway and watched rain begin again, thin and persistent.

The world outside our walls felt close.

Not because of Mysore.

Because of the Company.

---

Colonel Stuart visited later, without a train, without theatre.

He came with only one clerk and two sepoys, and he asked to speak privately.

Kesavadas met him in a smaller room, away from the court's listening ears.

I was present because Stuart preferred soldiers to priests.

I respected him for that.

Stuart looked tired.

"My government does not trust Tipu," he said, direct. "And Tipu does not accept humiliation quietly."

Kesavadas nodded. "We know."

Stuart continued, "There will be another war."

The words landed like a stone.

Kesava's jaw tightened.

"And when it comes," Stuart added, "you will need to decide where you stand."

Kesavadas did not blink.

"We stood when Tipu came," he replied. "We will stand again."

Stuart's gaze shifted, and for a moment I saw something almost like respect.

"Then prepare," he said. "And keep Captain Blackwood away from your stores. He will steal you blind while smiling."

Kesava snorted.

Stuart stood to leave.

At the door he paused and looked at me.

"You," he said, "were at the breach at Travancore."

"Yes," I replied.

"And at the skirmish near Alleppey," he added.

"Yes."

He looked at the brand on my forehead again, and I expected judgement.

Instead he said, quietly, "Men with ugly histories are often the ones who do not romanticise war."

Then he left.

When he was gone, Kesavadas exhaled slowly.

"The British are not one thing," he said. "Some are soldiers. Some are merchants. Some are thieves. But all of them believe the future belongs to them."

Kesava spat.

"The future belongs to whoever holds a blade," he said.

Kesavadas looked at him.

"No," he replied. "The future belongs to whoever holds the paper that says your blade is illegal."

Silence followed.

In that silence I understood that Tipu was not our only tiger.

He was simply the tiger we could see.
