# Chapter 26: The Treaty

Men talk about treaties as if they are peace.

They are not peace.

They are pauses, written down, sealed with wax and blood, and enforced by whoever has the bigger guns.

In 1792, when Tipu signed at Seringapatam, Travancore breathed again.

But the breath tasted of ink.

---

I saw Seringapatam first as a rumour made solid.

We had marched for weeks with allied forces, moving north and east through country that grew drier, flatter, less forgiving. Kerala's green fell away behind us. Rivers narrowed. The air lost its salt. Dust returned, fine and persistent, finding its way into cloth and mouth.

The British marched with confidence, their logistics a kind of arrogance. Bullock carts in lines. Powder under guard. Engineers measuring everything, including the patience of the land.

Indian allies marched with different reasons.

Some for pay.
Some for revenge.
Some because refusing the Company is another way of dying.

When we finally reached the Kaveri and saw the island fort, it looked like a beast crouched in water.

Walls rising from river.
Guns pointing from stone.
Flags snapping over battlements.

Tipu had built this place to be an answer to Europe.

Now Europe had come to his door with India at its side.

The siege itself was not my battle to tell. Others will write of the batteries, the trenches, the guns dragged through mud. Others will describe how the walls shuddered when British cannon found their rhythm.

I remember different things.

The smell of powder that never left the air.
The way men spoke in whispers as if the fort could hear them.
The way the river kept flowing, indifferent.

And I remember the day the treaty was made, because treaties are where the truth of war shows itself.

We were not allowed into the negotiations.

Indian allies rarely are.

We stood in the outer camp while men in clean coats argued over maps.

I watched Colonel Stuart walk past with a folder under his arm, face calm, eyes tired.

Captain Blackwood followed him, smiling as if this was a festival.

Blackwood's smile was never empty. It was always counting.

"They will bleed him," he said to another officer in English, voice bright. "Territory. Money. Hostages. The tiger will be declawed properly this time."

He noticed me looking and gave me a friendly nod, as if friendliness erased contempt.

I looked away.

There are kinds of hatred that exhaust you more than battle.

Kesava stood beside me, arms folded, jaw tight.

"They speak as if they own the victory," he muttered.

"They own the paper," I replied. "Paper becomes ownership."

Kesava snorted.

"You sound like Kesavadas," he said.

I did not deny it.

War had been teaching me lessons I had avoided when I was young and stupid and hungry for opium.

Violence makes you strong for a moment.

But paper makes you strong for generations.

---

When the treaty was finally signed, we did not hear the words first.

We heard the guns.

A salute, twelve shots, timed and deliberate.

The camp exhaled.

Men cheered.
Men fell to their knees.
Men laughed and cried as if those were the only two human sounds left.

Then the hostages came.

Tipu's sons, two boys in fine cloth, walked out under guard.

They were not infants.

They were old enough to understand that they were being traded.

They were old enough to understand that their father's empire was being cut into pieces on a table they could not see.

One boy held his head high, jaw clenched, eyes fierce with inherited pride.

The other looked down, lashes wet, trying to be brave and failing.

They walked between British officers like lambs between butchers.

I felt something twist in me.

I hated Tipu for what his men had done to Malabar. I hated him for the ditch full of smoke. I hated him for Caspar's body on stone.

And yet, looking at those boys, I could not pretend victory was clean.

A soldier can kill men and live with it.

Seeing children turned into currency is a different poison.

Kesava's mouth tightened.

"He would have done the same," he whispered, as if reading my thoughts. "Tipu would have taken our princes if he could."

"Yes," I replied.

That did not make it feel less filthy.

Father Thomas's words came back to me, unexpected.

God does not ask which army you rode with.
He asks what you did when you dismounted.

Watching those boys, I wondered what any of us had become when we dismounted from this war.

---

That night, the British camp celebrated.

Not like Travancore celebrates, with rituals and restraint.

The British celebrated with meat, rum, and the hard laughter of men who believe they are civilised because they drink from glass instead of clay.

Sepoys watched, faces unreadable.

Indian allies took what pay they could and tried to keep their anger quiet.

Captain Blackwood walked through the camp with a ledger in his hand and a grin on his face.

He spoke to a supplier, then to a quartermaster, then to a clerk.

Money moved with him like a shadow.

Colonel Stuart sat alone near a lantern, writing.

When I passed, he looked up briefly.

"You fought well in Travancore," he said in Portuguese, tone genuine.

I nodded, wary.

He gestured toward the distant fort, its outline black against the night.

"This is not over," he said quietly. "It never is."

Then he went back to his writing, as if the only defence against empire was to put words into order.

I returned to my tent and lay down with my knife beside me, like always.

Outside, men drank and sang.

Inside, I stared at the canvas and thought of Mariam and our small house by the backwaters.

Travancore had survived.

But now the British had tasted the peninsula more deeply, and men who taste power do not stop at one mouthful.
