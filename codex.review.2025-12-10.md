# Codex Review 2025-12-10

Comprehensive editorial review of all chapters in the current manuscript, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and concrete opportunities for refinement.

Throughout this document, suggestions assume the existing first person frame, the AGENTS guidelines on prose, and the current historical spine. No em dashes are used; where strong pauses are needed, prefer commas, colons, or full stops.

## Global notes

**Major strengths**

- Voice is rich, controlled, and distinct, with a compelling first person narrator who feels both competent and wounded.
- Historical texture is consistently strong: weapons, forts, trading patterns, religious politics, and Marakkar, Nair, matrilineal details all feel grounded and specific.
- Battle and siege sequences are vivid and tactically clear, especially Goa, the storm at sea, Colachel, and the multi front pressures in Book IV.
- Political scenes carry real charge: Ramayyan, Padmini, Revathi, Lannoy, and Marthanda Varma all have sharp, memorable voices and clear agendas.
- Emotional arcs of guilt, loyalty, and compromise deepen across books, culminating in a morally complex endgame where no choice is clean.

**Global issues to watch**

- Point of view drift: a few scenes in Book IV slip into third person omniscient without an explicit frame from Nagoji, which breaks the otherwise strict first person contract.
- Emotional temperature occasionally tips toward melodrama, especially in some of the more romantic or spiritual scenes (late Book II, parts of Book IV) where restraint would hit harder.
- Repetition of certain rhetorical moves and images (jackfruit tree, sand and storms metaphors, ledger imagery) risks blunting their power if not varied or pruned.
- Pacing in the middle books leans expository at times (especially Book II chapter 10 and Book III chapters 16 and 21); some explanation can likely be folded deeper into scene.
- The Sarpa Kavu and embrace sequence in Book II chapter 13 reads like it belongs to a more mystical, romantic register than the surrounding war and politics spine; it feels like an addon rather than an organic step.

Where relevant, these global notes are elaborated under specific chapters.

## Book I, Chapter 1: Dungeons of Goa

**What works**

- Opening line and paragraph are excellent: immediate voice, clear stakes, strong image of identity stripped to a ledger entry.
- The dungeon is sensory and immersive: smell, damp, the scrape of boots, the specific detail of fingernails already taken before Father Duarte arrives.
- Duarte himself is layered, not a stock villain; the question about whether Nagoji fights for God, plunder, or people creates a philosophical spine for the entire book.
- The torture is handled with restraint, focusing on mind and habit of counting rather than gore, which keeps it powerful and readable.
- The final turn to rumours of transport and the line “Storms do not ask permission” is a strong thematic button.

**What could be stronger**

- You occasionally lean on filter constructions here: “I watched,” “I heard,” “I decided.” Most are doing work, but a few can be cut to sharpen immediacy, letting the action itself carry the seeing and hearing.
- Consider tightening a small amount of exposition about past campaigns in the Konkan; a sentence or two less reminiscence would keep early momentum even tighter.
- The ideological exchange with Duarte is excellent; you could sharpen it further by trimming one or two rhetorical questions, so it feels less like a thesis statement and more like two men probing each other.

---

## Book I, Chapter 2: The Slave Ship South

**What works**

- Transition from dungeon to sunlight and harbour is beautifully handled, especially the “women like gossiping houses” balconies and the smell shift from filth to oil, bread, sea.
- The first view of the ship and the sense that “horses would hate this” keeps Nagoji’s identity rooted even as the physical context changes.
- The hold scenes are claustrophobic and effective without slipping into misery porn; Keshavrao’s loyalty is established economically and movingly.
- The trader voices above, counting bodies per head in cruzados, are chilling and tonally right.

**What could be stronger**

- Time compression at sea is mostly handled through rhythm, but you could add one or two concrete calendar or geography markers to anchor how long this voyage lasts before the storm of chapter 3.
- The foreshadowing of a storm and Keshavrao’s line about following wherever Nagoji jumps is strong; you might cut a line or two of explanation about Nagoji not wanting followers so the later payoff carries more of the emotional weight on its own.

---

## Book I, Chapter 3: The Choice in the Storm

**What works**

- The build up of the storm through ship movement rather than weather alone is excellent; the technical detail of how timbers sound and guards behave adds realism.
- The musket falling into the hold is a great physical catalyst that also symbolises power dropping into the prisoners’ world.
- The sequence of weakening the ring in the beam, freeing the collars, and using chaos to climb works both tactically and metaphorically.
- The moment of choice with Keshavrao, the rope, and the spar is one of the strongest moral beats in the book; the writing stays clear and unsentimental.

**What could be stronger**

- You are already close to perfect here; the only tweak would be to watch for one or two abstractions like “pain ceased to have degrees” which repeat a note from chapter 1. A more specific sensory line in that spot might keep the storm distinct from the dungeon.
- The “angry god” simile at the end is fine, but you might consider making it more grounded in Nagoji’s own cultural frame, since he is explicitly sceptical about gods choosing sides.

---

## Book I, Chapter 4: The Fishermen of the Pepper Coast

**What works**

- Landfall is vivid: the bodily violence of being spat onto sand, the specific smell of the fishermen, the moment of realising these are not Portuguese.
- The quick moral debate among the fishermen about whether to kill Nagoji or use him shows coastal realpolitik efficiently.
- Padmini Amma’s first entrance is strong even before she is named; the detail of betel stained smile turning serious is a nice character shorthand.
- The tone shifts from survival horror to cautious opportunity without losing tension.

**What could be stronger**

- When the fishermen and the woman discuss torture scars and brand marks, there is a small amount of repeated inference about “what kind of men they are” that can be tightened by one line.
- You might seed one stronger, concrete image of the larger Portuguese wreck here, to foreshadow later political interest in the loss and make the storm feel more consequential beyond Nagoji’s survival.

---

## Book I, Chapter 5: Road to Travancore

**What works**

- Ibrahim is an excellent addition: his scar habit, his cargo of “gifts” and his easy code switching mark him as a social and logistical hinge for the coast.
- The cart journey combines landscape, economic exposition (pepper smell, bulls, canals), and character work smoothly.
- The initial interview with the coastal officer about value and what Nagoji brings beyond what the king has is sharp and sets up a central question about usefulness.

**What could be stronger**

- A few of Ibrahim’s explanatory lines about the coastal intelligence network could be trimmed or split across later appearances; right now, he carries a lot of worldbuilding in this one chapter.
- Consider tightening the temple wayside scene by one beat; the old woman’s “storms in his bones” line is nice, but the explanation of what Ibrahim tells her might be shorter without losing flavour.

---

## Book I, Chapter 6: The Coastal Hall

**What works**

- First entrance into Marthanda Varma’s hall delivers on earlier build up: open to the sea, purposeful design, Ramayyan at his side, the spear rather than crown.
- The interrogation is a highlight: the dialogue triad between king, diwan, and Nagoji is taut, with layered agendas and clear tactical interest on all sides.
- The chapter nails the moment where Nagoji articulates his unique value: experience of riding into European volleys and breaking lines, which justifies his continued centrality.
- The “experiment” framing and the order to demonstrate something new on the coastal strip set up Book II elegantly.

**What could be stronger**

- There is a small amount of repetition of “what you do not yet have is someone who has ridden into a European line” between the compound scene and this hall; you might echo it more lightly rather than restating.
- Be careful not to over explain Ramayyan’s translations and interjections; readers grasp quickly that the king understands more than he pretends. A couple of those moments can be pruned for tautness.

---

## Book II, Chapter 7: Horses in Wet Sand

**What works**

- The training problem is concrete and original: Arcot horses and Maravar ponies on treacherous Malabar sand is a great tactical and symbolic challenge.
- Raza Khan and Ponnam Pandya Deven are differentiated well; their pride, rivalry, and eventual adjustment feel earned.
- The king and Ramayyan watching from the bluff gives the training sequence political stakes without intruding.
- The metaphor of moving like fish where the Dutch expect bulls is sharp and on theme.

**What could be stronger**

- The exposition about the precise tactical role of these drills repeats slightly; you might tighten by one paragraph, trusting that the reader has absorbed the earlier explanation.
- Small suggestion: somewhere in this chapter, seed one concrete limitation of the horses or men that will later matter at Colachel, so the drills do not feel like effortless success.

---

## Book II, Chapter 8: Padmini Amma’s Estate

**What works**

- The estate is beautifully drawn: matrilineal house architecture, pepper sorting, kalari pit, and domestic power are vivid and distinct from Deccan patriarchal structures.
- Padmini’s voice is a major asset: dry, unsentimental, politically sharp, but clearly rooted in care for land and house.
- The explanation of matrilineal inheritance, the room lineage, and the contrast with father line plough holdings is handled in scene, not lecture, which is effective.
- The hints about Velinadu, the eight houses, and Savitri’s future conflict are seeded without bogging the chapter down.

**What could be stronger**

- Occasional direct questions from Nagoji about why things are this way could be pared back; Padmini already answers through demonstration and sharp anecdotes.
- The final paragraph strongly states that he must learn female tongues as carefully as Dutch drill manuals; consider trimming one sentence to avoid over signalling a point you are already making.

---

## Book II, Chapter 9: Princess of Velinadu

**What works**

- Revathi’s entrance is very strong: language ability, directness, refusal to be placed as a sardar’s daughter, and her critique of treaties as nets all land.
- The dialogue is crackling, with subtext about lineage, land law, and Nagoji’s potential role as both asset and threat.
- The scene does heavy political lifting for matrilineal Velinadu, Elayadathu, and the fault line with Travancore’s state building without feeling like a lecture.

**What could be stronger**

- There are places where Revathi’s monologues risk becoming too expository, especially around Old Houses and treaties; you might let Nagoji interrupt or observe more, or move one or two details to later chapters to keep this debut scene lean and electric.
- The near romantic tension is well handled in restraint; maintain that by avoiding one or two slightly modern phrasing choices that feel anachronistic for the period, even in a modern voice.

---

## Book II, Chapter 10: Lessons in Travancore

**What works**

- The temple, market, drill ground, and backwater walk with Ramayyan is an excellent structural device to explain how the kingdom works as an interlocking system.
- The “temple as ledger” image is very strong and pays off later in the Thrippadidhanam.
- The depiction of Marakkar merchants, Syrian Christian scribes, and the backwater logistics is rich and grounded.

**What could be stronger**

- This chapter risks being slightly static compared to others; consider breaking it into two shorter sequences, each anchored in a small narrative disruption (a minor confrontation in the market, a drill mishap) so it feels less like a guided tour.
- The final passage about Nagoji’s reflections could be shortened by a paragraph; the point that everything ties together is clear and does not need restatement.

---

## Book II, Chapter 11: Dutch on the Horizon

**What works**

- The boy in the palm tree tower is a terrific device; his continued presence threads nicely through the maritime sections.
- Naming Lannoy through the boy’s misheard report builds myth before the man appears on land.
- The scenes in the war hall, with shells and pebbles as ships, and the Peshwa comparison, clarify Travancore’s vulnerability and resolve in one move.
- The decision to ride horses within sight of the ships to send a signal fits Nagoji’s role and the king’s strategic approach.

**What could be stronger**

- You may want one more concrete description of the Larger context of Dutch operations here, so that readers who are not familiar with Zeeland chambers and Java War understand why this four ship squadron matters.
- The contemplative night scene on the bluff is strong; trimming one or two metaphors would keep it from slowing the pace just before the diplomatic and combat escalations of later chapters.

---

## Book II, Chapter 12: Threads of Alliance

**What works**

- The court configuration with Dutch envoys, Velinadu women, local chiefs, and Syrian Christian merchants all in one hall is rich and tense.
- Revathi’s Portuguese intervention and her handling of company memory at Velinadu land is excellent.
- Ramayyan’s, Tharakan’s, and Ibrahim’s roles in triangulating between trade and sovereignty are well balanced.
- The introduction of Mavelikkara and Mannar treaty dynamics sets up the later “real treaty” pay off.

**What could be stronger**

- The paragraph where a chief names Kottarakkara, Elayadathu, and Savitri is powerful, but it sits mid scene; consider giving it a slightly clearer pause or beat so that readers recognise its importance.
- Be careful that the Dutch envoy does not become too generic; a tiny personal detail (age, nervous habit, a remembered prior arrogance) could make him distinct without humanising the company unduly.

---

## Book II, Chapter 13: The Eve of Colachel

**What works**

- The pre battle atmosphere is superb: weight of clouds, multiple streams of intelligence, Padmini’s multi layered responsibilities, and the threaded presence of Kottarakkara and Savitri.
- The temple rituals, mixed religious practices, and henna thin line between fear and resolve are vivid.
- Dhanaji’s conversation about leadership weight is a good mirror to earlier storm choices.

**What could be stronger**

- The Sarpa Kavu section in the second half is atmospheric but feels like a tonal departure; the Naga grove, twin presence of Revathi and Padmini, and the intimate embrace slide toward a mystical romance register that sits awkwardly beside the tightly grounded battle narrative around it.
  - Consider either trimming this sequence substantially, re grounding it in the same restrained tone as the rest of the book, or moving some of the Sarpa Kavu spiritual content to a quieter chapter where it can breathe without competing with the eve of Colachel.
- The explicit embrace and near confession scene between Nagoji and Revathi here may undermine the slow burn of their relationship elsewhere; you could keep the emotional stakes while dialling back physicality, letting later choices in Velinadu and marriage chapters carry more of the weight.

---

## Book III, Chapter 14: The Siege of Colachel

**What works**

- Reframing Colachel as a grinding siege rather than a single heroic charge is historically and narratively satisfying.
- Antony and the Mukkuvar night work at sea is one of the book’s great assets: tactically believable, morally edged, and thematically aligned with “water roads” from earlier.
- Lannoy’s portrayal through observation during the siege keeps him formidable even before capture.
- The lucky shot into the magazine is handled carefully: clearly set up, but still carrying the sense of war’s dice, which is honest.

**What could be stronger**

- Once the magazine explodes, you might add one short beat showing the impact on Travancore forces beyond awe, perhaps a risk of overconfidence or a near rash advance, to maintain tension.
- Consider a single sentence reminding readers of Karl August’s earlier sketch at the moment the shot lands, to close the tactical loop more explicitly.

---

## Book III, Chapter 15: Prisoners of a New King

**What works**

- The false “march out with arms” turns into captivity scene is tense and morally ambiguous in a way that suits the book; the lie vs misunderstanding line is nicely drawn.
- Lannoy’s audience at Udayagiri is excellent: the corporate logic of the company, Tharakan’s presence, and the king’s offer create a rich, complex conversion scene.
- The offer not to fight the Dutch directly but to help make fighting them unnecessary is a smart compromise and psychologically plausible.

**What could be stronger**

- Lannoy’s pivot feels right, but you might add one tiny personal hook (a remembered letter from home, a prior corporate slight) to deepen his internal motivation beyond company abandonment.
- Watch the repetition of “ledger” language here; you use it powerfully already in Ramayyan scenes. A single “ledger” reference is enough to make the point.

---

## Book III, Chapter 16: Building a New Army

**What works**

- The time measured in drills rather than days is a strong structural device for the post Colachel years.
- The fort reform descriptions, especially Lannoy’s angular bastions and low thick walls, are both historically accurate and visually compelling.
- The joint drills and friction between Lannoy and Nagoji are one of the book’s core pleasures; tactical disagreements feel grounded, not contrived.
- The assassination attempt at Udayagiri and the possible but rejected Velinadu link add an important note of ongoing danger and mistrust.

**What could be stronger**

- This chapter is dense; you could consider splitting it into two shorter chapters or adding one more narrative spike (a specific drill disaster, a fort construction accident) to break up exposition.
- Nagoji’s internal debate about returning to the Deccan is compelling; one fewer explicit explanation of why he stays would let subtext and earlier letters do more work.

---

## Book III, Chapter 17: The King’s Debt

**What works**

- The flashback to the chevar attacks from the Eight Houses and the cellar hiding makes Marthanda Varma’s debt to Padmini concrete and moving.
- The adoption scene is emotionally satisfying and culturally rich, with matrilineal law and temple purification woven through.
- Renaming Nagoji as Ananthan Pillai and making him Padmini’s son is a major turning point that is handled with weight.

**What could be stronger**

- The priestly “miracle” of rediscovered Nair lineage works, but you might reduce one or two explicit jokes about gold edited god writing; they are effective but risk making the ritual feel a little on the nose.
- The boy heir could use one sharper detail or later callback, since he becomes important again in the assassination scenes.

---

## Book III, Chapter 18: Dutch Come Bowing

**What works**

- The inversion of Lannoy’s status in Dutch eyes is satisfying and dramatically rich.
- Mannar negotiations are well handled, with clear trade offs between pepper flows, forts, and mutual threats.
- Revathi and Padmini’s commentary during and after keeps local houses’ perspectives in focus; the line about paper burning while land remembers is strong.

**What could be stronger**

- Similar to earlier Dutch court scenes, you might condense some of the treaty clause listing and instead emphasise one or two representative articles that matter most (fort construction, arming enemies).
- The final conversation between the envoy and Lannoy is good; perhaps trim one line of threat from the envoy so Lannoy’s quiet refusal carries more weight.

---

## Book III, Chapter 19: Shadows of the Deccan

**What works**

- The brother’s letter is excellent: voice distinct from Nagoji’s, mixing village detail, political rumours, and the Keshavrao story in a believable way.
- The Peshwa comparison and Ramayyan’s reaction show well how Deccan storms intersect with coastal calculations.
- Nagoji’s eventual decision to send gold and a “death” letter to his family is emotionally powerful and thematically appropriate.

**What could be stronger**

- The conversation with the king about potential Maratha interventions repeats some earlier points about usefulness and choice; you can likely trim a paragraph there without losing the ethical crux.
- The final “Ananthan Pillai” acceptance scene is strong; consider whether one fewer explicit “Deccan son is gone” statement might let the image of the jackfruit and neem do the work.

---

## Book III, Chapter 20: Guest in Velinadu

**What works**

- The marriage negotiation is very good: Revathi’s questions about pride, matrilineal descent, and his future son’s relation to Velinadu are sharp and plausible.
- The small marriage ceremony, with Padmini, Lannoy, and Ramayyan as witnesses, has the right scale and detail.
- The closing reflection on being “no longer only a sword, but also a husband and father” is earned.

**What could be stronger**

- Compared to earlier restrained tension, this chapter leans more overtly romantic; ensure that Revathi’s vulnerability does not undermine her established iron, especially in the “you already hold more than a sliver” lines. A hint less explicit declaration would keep her more in character.
- Later in the chapter, some future oriented description (children, what they will call him) could be shortened, relying on later Book IV scenes to show rather than tell.

---

## Book III, Chapter 21: Ramayyan’s Ledger

**What works**

- The ledger room is a terrific metaphor brought to life: clay tags, palm bundles, and the idea of men as lines.
- Showing Nagoji his own entry, as well as Elayadathu, Lannoy, and Ramayyan himself, concretises the moral stakes of surveillance.
- The balance between necessary state knowledge and the risk of paranoia is nicely articulated.

**What could be stronger**

- There is some repetition with earlier “lesson” chapters in explaining how Ramayyan uses information to prevent surprise; consider trimming one explanatory paragraph to keep this from feeling like a restatement.
- The recall of the temple assassination attempt is effective, but it edges into almost third person; you might re anchor it more firmly as “what I later learned” or “what I saw from my position” to maintain POV discipline.

---

## Book IV, Chapter 22: Command of the Marches

**What works**

- The temple assassination scene with the chevar is intense and well choreographed; the body work feels real.
- The interplay between Ramayyan, king, and Nagoji afterwards sets up the “marches” command offer well.
- Nagoji’s decision to accept the marches, knowing it locks his allegiance, is a key character moment that you handle with clarity.

**What could be stronger**

- This chapter introduces a potential point of view issue: much of the temple fight can be justified as experienced by Nagoji, but later description of Ramayyan’s earlier arguments is close to omniscient. You might add one or two first person signposts (“I later heard Ramayyan say…”) to keep the narrative frame honest.
- The “chevar” explanation is good; reiterate only once, trusting the reader to carry the term forward rather than re defining it.

---

## Book IV, Chapter 23: First Campaign for the Tiger

**What works**

- Transition to the marches is atmospheric; the smell and feel of the land evoke both continuity and difference from the Deccan.
- Kollamkara’s standoff on the road is tense and politically layered, with Padmini’s silent presence doing strong work.
- The valley fight and the internal “red haze” moment for Nagoji, pulled back by Dhanaji, are powerful in depicting the danger of becoming what he hates.
- The later private conversation between king and Ramayyan about using Nagoji’s butcher reputation strategically is chilling and effective.

**What could be stronger**

- The chapter splits between Nagoji first person and at least one extended third person scene (Ramayyan and the king reading the report); this POV breach is noticeable. Either:
  - Reframe those sections explicitly as “what I later heard Ramayyan say happened that night,” in Nagoji’s voice, or
  - Move them into a later reflective monologue where he describes hearing about that conversation, rather than narrating it as if present.
- The massacre description is strong but close to the line; a couple of the more graphic internal intentions (splitting to the navel) might have more impact if implied rather than fully spelled out, given how often brutality has already been shown.

---

## Book IV, Chapter 24: Under De Lannoy’s Standard

**What works**

- The “foreigner’s tooth” bastion and the combined standard are memorable images.
- The evolving partnership and mutual suspicion between Lannoy and Nagoji is well drawn, with specific, grounded tactical disagreements.
- The growing resentment among some chiefs is captured cleanly through a few well chosen grumbles and Padmini’s responses.

**What could be stronger**

- The chapter is thematically similar to earlier “building a new army” scenes; to avoid redundancy, you might cut one or two of the more generic “they resent foreign training” lines and keep only the ones that move politics forward.
- Watch POV here as well; the final reflections on standards and future kings are fine, but be sure they are firmly framed as Nagoji’s later thoughts, not general pronouncements.

---

## Book IV, Chapter 25: Ramayyan’s Test

**What works**

- The letter from Pune and the offer of estates and influence is a crucial temptation, and you set it up well.
- The writing scene, where Nagoji crafts a carefully partial response, is an excellent device to show his divided loyalties and sharpen the moral conflict.
- The choice to burn both letters rather than keep a foothold in the north is a powerful, irreversible act.
- Ramayyan’s explicit ledger note “Is ours” is chilling in its simplicity and satisfying for the long running ledger motif.

**What could be stronger**

- The initial reading of the letter from Pune slightly repeats earlier Deccan shadow content; you might shorten the recap of what Maratha masters plan, focusing on the new offer rather than retelling.
- Revathi’s later comment about this being a chain is strong; if you want the chain image to resonate even more, you could seed a very light echo of it earlier in the book.

---

## Book IV, Chapter 26: Fire in the Pepper Fields

**What works**

- The tactical problem is rich and painful: raiders using Padmini’s pepper as cover forces a choice between land and security.
- The council scene where Padmini consents, with fury, is one of the most emotionally complex in the book.
- The burn itself is vividly written and morally fraught; the description of ash tasting the same whether burned by raiders or by their own is excellent.
- The aftermath, with Padmini and Revathi each angry in different ways, brings long running fault lines to the surface in a satisfying, painful way.

**What could be stronger**

- Because this is one of the most morally difficult chapters, restraint matters. A couple of the more explicit statements about “I did not know which ash is heavier” and “this was necessary, not kind” could potentially be trimmed or rephrased so that the images do more of the work.
- The closing aside about Ibrahim’s ambiguous role is interesting; consider either expanding slightly in a later chapter or cutting here to avoid raising a question you do not intend to answer.

---

## Book IV, Chapter 27: The Northern Crowns

**What works**

- The map with coloured inks for Mysore, Nizam, Arcot, and Europeans is a strong visual way to show encirclement.
- Savitri is a compelling antagonist: legitimate, intelligent, and morally credible, which makes her defeat hurt.
- The exile scene and her warning about stories outlasting walls are excellent.
- The Thrippadidhanam sequence is superb: temple imagery, vault history, and the strategic brilliance of giving the kingdom to the deity are all handled with power and clarity.
- The final reflective section, with the young officer, Nagoji’s answer about missing the cost, and the rain over different lives, is a satisfying and weighty ending.

**What could be stronger**

- This is a big chapter. You might consider splitting it into two, with one focusing on Kottarakkara and Savitri, and the second on Thrippadidhanam, to allow each to breathe and land fully.
- There is a brief third person slip during the Savitri arc (“The fall of Thekkumkur…” and commentary on what the king needed), which can be reframed in first person as Nagoji’s later understanding or cut if not strictly necessary.
- Revathi’s final confrontation is very good; you might tighten it by one or two lines to avoid restating that she will remember when others forget, which has already been communicated strongly.

---

## Closing recommendation

The manuscript as it stands is already at a very high level: voice driven, historically grounded, and emotionally honest. The main work ahead is not structural surgery, but targeted refinement.

Focus first on:

- Cleaning POV drift in Book IV and any other stray omniscient moments, keeping the intimacy and unreliability of the first person frame.
- Tuning a few over heated emotional passages so that restraint lets the most important beats land harder.
- Managing repetition of key metaphors and rhetorical moves so that storms, ledgers, jackfruit trees, and sand retain their power each time they appear.

Once these passes are done, the text should be extremely close to publish ready at the level of literary narrative history you are aiming for.
