# Book II, Chapter 13: The Eve of Colachel

The day before Colachel smelled of coconut smoke and rain that had not yet fallen.

Clouds had gathered over the sea since morning, thick and low, their underbellies a dark grey that matched the mood along the coast. The air was heavy, each breath like drinking warm water. Even the waves seemed to roll in with less enthusiasm, as if waiting for something.

We waited with them.

Reports had come in all day.

From the boy on the palm tower: Dutch ships shifting their positions offshore, boats running between them and the coast, sails furled and unfurled like nervous fingers.

From Ibrahim and his Marakkar cousins: supply craft cut loose in the night, anchors sabotaged, small fires flickering briefly on distant decks.

From inland chiefs: men mustering, some eager, some sullen; grain moved toward the fort; rumours of certain houses grumbling that this was not their quarrel.

From Kottarakkara: nothing. A silence that Ramayyan noted without comment, his stylus pausing over the name before moving on. When I asked about it, he only said, "Some absences speak louder than presence." Padmini, overhearing, made a sound that was not quite a laugh. "The Elayadathu chief counts Dutch masts and waits to see which way the wind blows. His kinswoman Savitri writes letters to Velinadu asking whether this is the moment." She did not say what moment. She did not need to.

From Velinadu: Revathi Bayi sending word that she would remain within her halls, Velinadu men ready to move if the Dutch threatened their share of the coast. The message was formal, correct, empty of warmth. Padmini read it twice. "She is watching too," she murmured. "Watching to see whether her king is worth her kinswoman's silence."

Padmini Amma moved through all of this like a pivot.

In the morning, I saw her in her fields, walking the bunds with bare feet despite the heat, speaking to men and women who bent over pepper vines. She told them which plants would be stripped early to feed troops and which would be left to ripen for trade, a calculation that balanced war and future harvest.

“You will not take the vines on that ridge,” she told one village headman. “If the Dutch burn the lower fields, we will still have pepper to sell them at higher prices when they crawl back.”

He blinked, then grinned.

“Always thinking of profit, Amma,” he said.

“Profit is survival written on a ledger,” she replied. “Go. Make sure the granaries are locked. If any man tries to sell grain to a company agent at the old price tomorrow, I will make him eat dust for a month.”

By noon, she was at the fort, her stick tapping stone as she walked along the ramparts.

“The walls will hold,” she said, more to herself than to me. “If the men do.”

In the afternoon, she sat in a small room near the war hall, counting out cloth and grain for the families of men who would ride or march at dawn.

“We do not let our soldiers worry about whether their children will eat while they face Dutch guns,” she said. “Fear is heavy enough without empty stomachs.”

By sunset, she was back at her estate, watching as boys carried oil to the temple, as women lit lamps in doorways, as the shadows lengthened.

“You will ride from here in the morning,” she told me, standing under the jackfruit tree where so many of our conversations had begun. “Your horses will leave hoofprints in my yard. Do not waste them.”

“I will try not to trample anything you wish to keep,” I said.

“The sea and the Dutch will trample more than you ever could,” she said. “Just make sure that when they do, they taste sand with it.”

While she moved through her layers of responsibility, I moved through mine.

In the coastal training ground, I rode with the Arcot and Nair horsemen one last time before the real test. We did not run full drills. It was too late to teach new tricks. Instead, we rode slowly along the wet sand, letting the horses feel the ground under different tides.

“Remember,” I told them, “you do not have to kill every Dutchman to win. You have to break their line, their nerve, their belief that you will always fall before their guns. If you survive one volley and reach them still moving, half their courage will die before any man does.”

Raza Khan adjusted his turban.

“We have fought men with guns before,” he said. “But we have not fought men who think their God has given them all the guns that matter.”

“Then we teach their God some humility,” I said.

Later, in the fort courtyard, I walked among the Nair footsoldiers.

They sat cleaning muskets, checking powder flasks, tying talismans around their wrists and arms. Some muttered mantras under their breath. Others joked too loudly, voices a shade too high.

I stopped near a group of young men who had drilled under the European instructor and under Deccan cavalry eyes both.

“You have seen their ships now,” I said. “Do they look like gods?”

One laughed, nervously.

“They look like houses turned on their sides,” he said. “With too many sticks.”

“And the men on them?” I asked.

“They look like men,” another said. “Too pale. Too stiff.”

“Good,” I said. “Remember that when they fire. Their powder burns the same. Their blood spills the same. Their screams sound the same when steel touches them.”

In the war hall, maps lay open again.

Marthanda Varma studied them with that same stillness I had come to recognise, the kind that meant all his thinking had narrowed to a fine point.

“They will land here,” he said, tapping a stretch of beach near the small fishing town of Colachel. “It is close enough to their ships to feel safe, close enough to inland tracks to threaten us.”

Ramayyan moved tokens, placing small shells where we had scouts, pebbles where we believed allied chiefs still held firm, a single thin bone where rumours said one local house might waver.

“We have cut their supply craft,” he said. “If we hold them on the beach and at the first line of coconut groves, they will bleed faster than we do.”

“And if we fail?” I asked.

The king did not look up.

“Then they march inland,” he said. “They burn this hall. They tear down Padmini's house. They drag Velinadu men in chains to their ships. They tell Batavia that Travancore is a lesson in what happens to those who forget their place.”

He raised his eyes then, and the weight in them made the air feel heavier.

“We will not fail,” he said. “But we should not pretend the price will be light. Tell your horsemen this. I do not ask them to die for me. I ask them to make sure the Dutch do not think they can kill a kingdom with one landing.”

Night came down slowly.

The clouds that had hung low all day finally let go a thin drizzle, just enough to sharpen the smell of earth and sea. Lamps flickered on one by one in houses and halls. In the temple courtyards, priests chanted louder than usual, as if hoping their gods could be persuaded to pay special attention in the morning.

Back at Padmini Amma's estate, a quiet settled that felt almost like the pause between inhaling and exhaling.

Men who would normally have gathered to talk after supper sat with their families instead, fingers tracing outlines on children's faces, hands resting a little longer on wives' shoulders. Women moved with restless energy, checking and rechecking that rice jars were full, that lamps had enough oil, that clothes for mourning lay where they could be found if needed.

Under the jackfruit tree, Kulkarni, one of my senior riders from the Deccan who had survived Goa's dungeons alongside me, sat sharpening his talwar.

“You ever think you would be here, sahib?” he asked, using the old title out of habit. “At the edge of a southern sea, about to ride at Dutch guns for a king who is not yours”

“The gods have poor handwriting,” I said. “If they wrote this in my horoscope, the astrologer must have fallen asleep.”

He chuckled, then grew serious.

“The men trust you,” he said. “They grumble about sand and salt, but when you say 'ride', they will.”

“That is what frightens me,” I said.

He looked up, surprised.

“You are not afraid of Dutch guns?” he asked.

“Guns I understand,” I said. “Men who follow because they believe you see further than they do, that is a weight I am still learning how to carry.”

Kulkarni's gaze softened.

“You carried it on the Godavari,” he said. “You carried it when we hit Portuguese caravans. You carried it when you chose to jump from that ship and leave a boy behind rather than let both of you drown for nothing. Do not pretend this is new.”

The mention of Keshavrao landed like a stone in my chest.

“It feels different here,” I said. “There, we rode for hills we knew. For forts that had our banners. Here, I ride for a king I have known barely a year, on land whose gods I do not fully understand.”

“The bullets will not stop to ask whose gods you prayed to,” Kulkarni said. “You ride for the man you chose when you did not run north. That is enough for now.”

Padmini appeared then, her stick tapping softly.

“You men brood too much,” she said. “Brooding does not stop bullets either. Sleep. Or try. The dawn will not wait for your thoughts.”

“Will you sleep, Amma?” I asked.

“A little,” she said. “I have lived through enough wars to know that the night before is rarely the one to fear. It is the nights after that keep you awake.”

Later, as most of the house settled into uneasy rest, I walked out toward the edge of her lands.

From a low ridge, I could see the faint glow where the fort lamps burned, the darker line of the sea beyond. Somewhere near Colachel, men on both sides lay in whatever shelter they had, listening to different prayers and the same waves.

Footsteps crunched on the dry leaves behind me.

“I thought you might be here,” Revathi's voice said.

I turned. She stood a little way off, wrapped in a shawl against the damp air. Padmini must have sent word to Velinadu. Or perhaps Revathi had simply decided on her own to come closer to the place where the land would be tested.

“You travel at odd times, Bayi,” I said.

“So do storms,” she replied. “I wanted to see the coast before it changes.”

She moved to stand beside me, looking out.

“There is a moment,” she said quietly, “before every great event, when the land holds its breath. Birds become quiet. Dogs whine. Old women feel their joints ache. This is that moment.”

“You sound like a priest,” I said.

“Do not insult me,” she replied, but there was a hint of humour under the sharpness.

We stood in silence for a while.

“You will ride with his horse,” she said at last. “You will strike at the Dutch lines. Songs will be written about men like you. About Arcot lancers and Nair riders who broke the company square. People will forget the women who counted grain and signed treaties and warned chiefs not to sell their souls for cheap cloth.”

“You have made sure I will not forget,” I said.

She glanced at me sideways.

“See that you do not,” she said. “Tomorrow, when you feel the rush of hooves and the roar of guns, remember that the land you churn belongs to many names. When you shout your war cry, remember that some of us are shouting ours in quieter ways.”

“What is your war cry, Bayi?” I asked.

She considered.

“No,” she said. “We do not shout. We endure. We bend until men think we will break, then we stand up again when they move on. It is less dramatic. It lasts longer.”

A light rain began to fall, fine as dust.

“You should go back inside,” I said. “You will catch cold.”

She snorted.

“Spoken like a man who has never seen a woman give birth in the middle of a monsoon,” she said. “Keep your worries for your horses.”

She turned to go, then stopped.

“Nagoji,” she said without looking back. “If you die tomorrow, die facing the right direction. Do not give the Dutch the satisfaction of seeing your back.”

Then she walked away into the dark.

When I finally lay down on the mat Padmini's people had given me, sleep came in fragments.

In one fragment, I was again in the Goan dungeon, chains cold against my skin. In another, I was on the storm struck ship, rope burning my hands as Keshavrao vanished into the black water. In a third, I was on that wet strip of sand, horses pounding beside me, Dutch muskets spitting fire.

In the last fragment before dawn, I stood alone on a beach that was both Colachel and not, the sea on one side, the fort on the other, the sound of drums carrying on the wind.

When the real drums began, calling men to arms in the grey before sunrise, they sounded exactly like the ones in my dream.

The eve was over.

The storm was here.
That night, before the last orders went out, the temple near the fort held a special puja.

Not the noisy, sprawling festival of harvest or marriage, but a focused, tight ceremony meant to steady hands that would hold weapons at dawn. Oil lamps were set in long rows along the outer wall. Men and women moved past them with cupped palms, touching each flame lightly, then pressing that faint heat to their eyelids and chests.

Padmini stood near the inner gate, handing small packets of kumkum and ash to any soldier who wished to take them. Some men tied the cloth around their wrists, others tucked it into their belts. A few, mostly Arcot horsemen, hung back, respectful but wary of unfamiliar gods.

Ibrahim brought a small brass lamp from the mosque by the shore and set it discreetly near the temple steps, the light from it mingling with the others.

“The sea does not care whose name you call when it takes you,” he murmured to me. “Best to have several listening.”

Even Lannoy, still a prisoner then, watched from a shadowed corner under guard, eyes moving over the lit faces.

“In my land,” he said quietly, “we bless cannon with Latin. Here you bless men with oil. I do not know which is wiser.”

“We will find out tomorrow,” I said.

When the last chant faded and the priests banked the central flame, the air in the courtyard felt thicker, not with smoke, but with the weight of what had been asked and promised in whispers.

Then the drums began again, this time in the fort, and the quiet closed with them.
