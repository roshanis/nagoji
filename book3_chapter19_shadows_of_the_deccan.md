# Book III, Chapter 19: Shadows of the Deccan

News from the Deccan arrived the way monsoon storms do.

Not as a single, clear front, but as a series of clouds that thickened until you realised the sky had changed.

Sometimes it came in letters, carefully wrapped in cloth and tucked into the luggage of a trader whose loyalties could be bought or trusted. Sometimes it came as gossip in the mouth of a caravan guard who had drunk too much toddy at a wayside stall. Sometimes it came in the eyes of a man who had walked too far in too few days to be merely passing through.

For a long time after Goa and the storm, I had trained myself not to look north too often. The work in Travancore had needed my full attention. Sand, horse, fort, Dutch. The Deccan had receded to the edges of my waking mind, surfacing only at night in dreams of black soil and dry wind.

Then a letter arrived with my village's dust still clinging to it.

Padmini found me in the shade of the jackfruit tree, as she often did, and tossed the small bundle into my lap.

“From your hills, my son,” she said, her voice softer than usual. “The boy who brought it walked like a man used to stones, not sand. He eats too fast. That is how I know he comes from a place where grain is a worry.”

My fingers trembled slightly as I unwrapped the cloth.

Inside was a folded piece of paper, not palm leaf, bearing my name in a hand I recognised even before I read the words.

My younger brother's, grown more angular since I had last seen it.

Nagoji anna,

We heard from a trader that you did not drown. I would have been offended if the sea had kept you. This land needs you more than salt does.

Our parents live. Their backs bend more than before, but they still walk the fields at dawn and argue with each other over how much seed to risk in each plot. Father says the sky is more unreliable than the Peshwa. I am not sure which is the greater insult.

The world here turns as it always has and yet not.

The Peshwa grows more powerful. New chiefs rise. Old ones fall. There are quarrels with men in Delhi and men in Mysore and men with names I did not hear when you left. Our forts still stand, but their banners change more often. Some say the Maratha hand is strong. Others say each finger pulls in a different direction.

He wrote of local matters too.

A neighbour's death. A cousin's marriage. A new well that had finally struck water after so many failed attempts that the villagers now treated it like a miracle.

Then, near the end, a single line that made my chest tighten.

Do you remember Keshavrao, who sat in the cell with you near the coast before they took you away We heard a tale from a coastal trader that a boy with his name died trying to escape a Portuguese ship. There are many boys and many names. Stories change as they travel. I do not know if this is true. I only know that when I heard it, I thought of you and the sea.

The words blurred for a moment.

We heard a tale.

Not a report. Not a record. A story. Yet stories carry their own weight.

I saw again the black water boiling around the ship, the rope burning my hands, the moment the line went taut and then snapped free. Keshavrao's face, eyes wide, mouth open, vanished under a wave.

I had known, in my bones, that the sea had kept him. Seeing the shape of the tale written in my brother's hand pressed that knowledge into ink.

At the bottom of the letter, almost an afterthought, he had written:

The Peshwa's court has heard of a southern king who broke white men on a beach. They argue over whether it was luck or craft. Some say we should send men to learn. Some say we should conquer him before he grows too strong. I thought you might want to know that your new king's name has reached our hills, even if they mispronounce it.

I sat for a long time with the letter in my hands.

The jackfruit tree's shade shifted. The sounds of the estate moved around me. Women called to each other. Boys shouted in the kalari. Somewhere, a pot clanged.

Deccan names wrapped themselves around Travancore sounds in my head until it felt as if two different songs were playing at once.

When I finally folded the letter and tucked it into my belt, Padmini was still there, watching from a respectful distance.

“Bad news?” she asked.

“Mixed,” I said. “Which is the only kind that travels far.”

“Your people live,” she said. It was not a question.

“Yes,” I said. “For now.”

“And the men who rule your hills?” she asked.

“They grow sharper,” I said. “And more divided.”

She nodded.

“Sharp and divided,” she said. “Dangerous combination.”

Later, in the hall, I found Ramayyan bent over his palm leaves, as usual.

“You have letters from the north,” he said without looking up. “The boy who brought them nearly ate his fingers when given rice. That is a Deccan hunger.”

“You knew before I did,” I said.

“It is my work to know where wind blows from,” he replied.

“The wind says my Peshwa has heard your king's name,” I said. “Some in his court talk of learning from Travancore. Others talk of conquering it.”

Ramayyan's stylus paused.

“News travels fast when it flatters and when it threatens,” he said. “We expected this.”

“You expected the Marathas to come south?” I asked.

“I expected them to notice that there is one less European company on this stretch of coast,” he said. “Men who dream of empire do not ignore gaps on the map.”

He finally looked up at me.

“Do you wish to go back?” he asked.

The question was blunt, but his tone was not unkind.

“Part of me always does,” I said. “Part of me has already written my own funeral on those hills. Hard to say which part is louder on any given day.”

“The king knows this,” Ramayyan said. “He would be a fool not to.”

That evening, Marthanda Varma summoned me.

We sat not in the crowded war hall, but in a smaller room off to the side, its walls lined with shelves of palm leaves and a few cloth wrapped volumes that had once been Portuguese property.

He held my brother's letter in his hand.

“Your people write well,” he said. “Your brother has a quick mind. I like his joke about the sky and the Peshwa.”

“He does not have to face either directly,” I said. “That makes jokes easier.”

The king smiled faintly, then let the expression fade.

“He tells you that your homeland has heard of me,” he said. “That some in your former master's court admire Colachel, others fear it.”

“Yes.”

“He also tells you of quarrels, of shifting banners,” the king said. “None of that surprises me. The Maratha confederacy is a storm with many centres. What interests me is this.”

He tapped the line about conquering Travancore.

“Do you think they will try?” he asked.

I thought of the men in Pune, of their hunger for land and revenue, of their pride.

“If they think you are weak, yes,” I said. “If they think you are useful, they will keep you as you are, so long as you do not interfere with their plans. They have many enemies closer to home.”

“And you” he asked. “If they called you back, if they sent a letter with your brother, ordering you to return to serve under their banner again, what would you do”

The words landed like weights on the mat between us.

I thought of my father, his back bent over a plough. Of my mother, her hands stained with turmeric and oil. Of my brother, sitting by lamp light, tongue between his teeth as he wrote this letter. Of Deccan forts where I had first learned to count men and cannons.

I also thought of this king, sitting on a low platform surrounded by palm leaves and rolled maps, building a new kind of state because the old kinds were crumbling under European pressure.

“I would read the letter,” I said slowly. “I would weigh it. I would remember Goa. I would remember the storm. I would remember Colachel. Then I would choose.”

“You do not say which way you would choose,” he said.

“Because I am not arrogant enough to think I know what the world will look like when that letter arrives,” I said. “If it arrives.”

He studied me.

“Honest,” he said. “I prefer honest answers to pious lies.”

He set the letter down.

“Understand this, Nagoji,” he said. “You are useful to me because you are Maratha *and* because you are Padmini's son. You can speak to men in Pune in a way my other nobles cannot. You can tell them what you have seen here. You can make them fear and respect this kingdom, or you can make them see it as prey.”

His gaze sharpened.

“If you ever choose the second, we will stand on opposite sides of a very narrow river,” he said. “If you choose the first, you will have my gratitude. For whatever that is worth.”

“Gratitude does not stop bullets,” I said.

“No,” he said. “But it weighs on scales you cannot see yet.”

He waved a hand, dismissing the solemnity with a flick.

“For now, you stay,” he said. “There is still Dutch paper to manage and Mysore greed to watch. The north will have to wait its turn.”

When I left the room, the air outside felt thicker.

The shadows of the Deccan had lengthened into Travancore's corridors.

In the days that followed, I noticed small changes in the way some men looked at me.

Not mistrust exactly. More calculation.

In their eyes, my usefulness now had a clear expiry date. As long as I pointed my gaze and my horse south and west, toward Dutch and Mysore threats, I was an asset. The moment my head turned too often north, I would become a risk.

Padmini, as always, cut through the fog with a single remark.

“You cannot stand with one foot in each river forever,” she said as we watched men load supplies for a northern fort. “At some point you must choose which current to let carry you.”

“What if I cling to a rock between them?” I asked.

“Then you drown slower,” she said. “But you still drown.”

Revathi was blunter.

“Your hills call you,” she said one evening on the Velinadu verandah. “Your king here calls you. You are flattered to be wanted by both. Do not let that flattery blind you to the fact that neither will mourn very long if they must cut you loose.”

“You have a cruel tongue,” I said.

“No,” she said. “I have an impatient one.”

She leaned back against the carved pillar, a playful glint entering her eyes that softened the hard truth of her words.

“Besides,” she added, “do not let that silver chain weigh you down with too much hope. Even if you have a *tharavad* now, I am a Princess of Velinadu. We do not marry commoners, Nagoji. Even ones who think they have found a root.”

It was said in jest, but the wall was there, invisible and ancient.

That impatient tongue was right. I could not stand in two rivers.

That night, I did not sleep.

I sat on the verandah of my quarters, watching the moon trace its slow arc over the coconut palms. The estate was quiet save for the rhythmic croak of frogs in the irrigation channels and the distant bark of a village dog.

I looked at my hands in the moonlight. The fingernails had grown back, but wrong—ridged and discoloured where the Portuguese interrogators had torn them out. I had stopped noticing them months ago. Now I studied them as if seeing them for the first time.

These hands had held Maratha reins on Deccan dust. They had gripped Portuguese chains in Goa's darkness. They had pulled Keshavrao toward a rope that broke. They had trained Travancore cavalry in wet sand and held a dying chevar's wrist while a king drove steel through his throat.

Whose hands were they now?

I thought of my father's hands, thick-knuckled from decades of plough and sword. Of my mother's hands, always moving, grinding spices at dawn, the stone *sil-batta* keeping time with her morning prayers. Of my brother's hands, ink-stained, scratching words onto paper by lamplight.

They did not know the man those hands had made me. They remembered a son, a brother, a Maratha horseman who rode north to raid Portuguese forts and never came home. That man had been simpler. He had known which rivers were his.

Somewhere in the black water off this coast, Keshavrao's bones lay tangled in Portuguese wreckage. He had followed me. He had trusted me. And I had let go.

I could not bring him back. But I could stop pretending that the man who failed him still existed.

The decision, when it came, arrived not as a thunderclap but as a settling, like silt finding the riverbed after a flood. I had been fighting the current for years. Now I would let it carry me.

The next morning, I went to the market near the harbour, to a stall run by a Gujarati *sowcar*, a money changer whose networks of trust ran deeper than any royal decree.

I placed a heavy pouch on his table. It was gold, borrowed from Padmini Amma’s private vault. A debt I would repay with service, or blood.

“This goes to Nashik,” I said. “To the house of Ramji Sawant.”

The trader weighed the pouch, his eyes widening slightly at the heft. “It is a long road, *Karyakkar*. Roads have bandits. Bandits have hunger.”

“It travels by your *hundi*,” I said. “Your paper is worth more than gold on the road. Do not tell me otherwise.”

He nodded, a flicker of respect in his gaze. He wrote out the note of credit, his hand steady.

“And this?” he asked, pointing to the sealed letter I had placed beside the gold.

“This travels with it,” I said.

I had written it the night before, by a dying lamp. It was short.

*To Bhalerao Sawant,*

*The man known as Nagoji died at Colachel. The sea that took Keshavrao took him too, in a different way. Do not look for him. He fights battles that are no longer yours.*

*Use this gold to buy new seed, to fix the roof, to keep the creditors from the door. It is the last debt he owed you.*

*Forget his name. Remember his love.*

It was a lie. And it was the truest thing I had ever written.

“It will reach them,” the trader said, sealing the transaction with a stamp of red wax. “My word is iron.”

“See that it is,” I said.

I walked back to the fort feeling lighter, as if I had cut a heavy pack from my saddle.

When I reached Padmini’s estate, she was waiting by the gate, leaning on her stick. She looked at my empty hands, then at my face.

“The letter is sent?” she asked.

“Yes,” I said.

“And the man who wrote it?”

“He stayed at the market,” I said. “He is not coming back.”

She nodded slowly, her eyes searching mine.

"Then who stands before me?" she asked.

I touched the cold silver of the chain around my neck. I looked at the red tiled roof of the *tharavad* that had sheltered a king and now sheltered me. I tasted the air, heavy with pepper and sea salt. It no longer tasted foreign.

For a moment, I felt the pull of two currents—the dry wind of the Deccan, smelling of dust and millet and my mother's turmeric-stained hands; and the wet breath of this coast, carrying salt and pepper and the jasmine Padmini wore in her hair. They had been at war in my chest for years.

Now, standing at this gate, I let one of them go.

Not forgotten. Never forgotten. But released, the way you release a horse too old to ride—with gratitude, with grief, with the knowledge that holding on would only make both of you suffer.

I looked at my scarred hands one last time. Nagoji Sawant's hands. Hands that had failed Keshavrao, that had been broken by Portuguese iron, that had somehow found their way to this red-tiled house on a pepper coast.

They would not change. The scars would remain. But the name attached to them could.

"Ananthan Pillai," I said.

The name felt strange on my tongue, new and stiff like unconquered leather. But it fit. Ananthan—the endless one, the serpent who holds up worlds. Pillai—the suffix that marked me as Padmini's son, as a man with roots in this soil even if his bones remembered another.

Nagoji Sawant had died in the black water with Keshavrao. The sea had just taken longer to tell him.

Padmini Amma smiled, an expression that cracked the iron mask she usually wore.

“Welcome home, Ananthan Pillai,” she said. “Dinner is ready. Do not make us wait.”

As I stepped through the gate, I caught sight of Revathi’s latest letter tucked into Padmini’s waistband, its edge stained with lamp smoke. I knew its outward words would be correct and cool, all talk of levies and Velinadu rights, but somewhere between them there would be a line that cut deeper. She never named worry, but she folded it into the way she asked whether the king's new walls were worth the men they ate.

The thought that my new name might one day be spoken in her halls as easily as in this courtyard lodged itself like a small, dangerous hope.

I followed Padmini inside.

The Deccan son was gone. Another man, with two coasts in his chest, had taken his place.

The Travancore soldier had finally arrived.

For the moment, that was enough.
