# Chapter 2: The Hunters

The first week was the worst.

Not because of the pursuit - though the Deshmukh's men were never far behind. Not because of the hunger or the cold nights sleeping in ditches and under bridges. The worst part was the sickness.

Opium does not release its prisoners easily. For seven days, my body screamed for what I had denied it. I sweated through my clothes, then shivered until my teeth cracked against each other. My stomach heaved up everything I tried to eat. My muscles cramped and seized. There were moments when I considered turning back, surrendering myself to the Deshmukh's justice, simply to make the suffering stop.

Once, passing a cluster of huts outside a village, I caught the smell of it on the wind - sweet and rotten at the same time, like fruit left too long in the sun. My mouth filled with saliva. My hands began to shake in a different way. For a heartbeat my feet turned towards that smell as if I had never had a choice in the matter.

I bit my tongue until I tasted blood and kept walking.

But I kept seeing my father's face. I kept hearing his voice - *Go. Do not stop until you reach the river.* He had died so that I might live. To throw that away, to let his sacrifice mean nothing - even I was not that far gone.

So I walked. I crawled when I could not walk. I stole food when I could find it and went hungry when I could not. And slowly, day by day, the sickness loosened its grip.

By the eighth day, I could think again. By the tenth, I could plan.

The planning was simple: go south. Find Travancore. Find the man my father had called Ananthan Pillai. Everything else - food, shelter, safety - was secondary to the simple act of putting distance between myself and Sangamner.

But the Deshmukh was not content to let me go.

I first saw his hunters on the road to Ahmednagar.

There were three of them, mounted on good horses, moving fast along the main road while I crept through the fields parallel to it. I recognised the colours they wore - the Deshmukh's household, red and gold. They stopped at every village, spoke to every traveller. I was too far away to hear their words, but I did not need to hear them. They were showing my description. Asking if anyone had seen a young man with a branded forehead.

I touched the cloth I had wrapped around my head. The wound had begun to heal, crusting over with scab tissue, but the shape of the Devanagari letters was already visible. *Brahman-hatyara.* Even when the wound fully healed, the scar would remain. I would wear those letters until the day I died.

The hunters moved on. I waited until they were out of sight, then changed direction, heading east instead of south. I would have to find another route.

This became the pattern of my flight. Move at night when I could. Hide during the day. Avoid the main roads, the villages, anywhere I might be seen and remembered. When I had to interact with people - to buy food, to ask directions - I kept my head wrapped and my eyes down. I told them I had been burned in a fire. Some believed me. Others looked at me with suspicion but said nothing.

The Deshmukh's reach was long, but the Deccan was vast. If I could just keep moving, keep ahead of the hunters, I might make it to the southern kingdoms where his name meant nothing.

If.

The first time they almost caught me was near Parner.

I had grown careless. The sickness was fading, my strength returning, and I had begun to believe that I might actually escape. I stopped at a roadside well to drink, and I let the cloth slip from my forehead while I bent over the water.

A woman was watching.

She was drawing water on the other side of the well, and when I looked up, our eyes met. I saw her gaze move to my forehead, saw her expression change from curiosity to horror to recognition. She had heard the descriptions. She knew what those letters meant.

I ran before she could scream.

Behind me, I heard her voice raised in alarm. Ahead, the road stretched empty and exposed. I plunged into the scrubland beside it, thorns tearing at my clothes and skin, and I kept running until I could no longer hear anything but my own ragged breathing.

That night, I did not sleep. I lay in a dry streambed, staring up at the stars, and I thought about how close I had come. One moment of carelessness. One woman at a well. That was all it took.

I could not afford to be careless again.

The horse saved my life.

I found it three days later, wandering loose in a field with a broken bridle trailing from its head. A farmer's horse, probably, escaped from its tether. It was not a good animal - old, swaybacked, with a temperament as sour as its smell. But it was a horse, and I was my father's son.

Dhanaji had put me on a horse before I could walk. Whatever else I had become - addict, thief, murderer - I could still ride. The old skills came back to me as I approached the animal, speaking softly, moving slowly. It tried to shy away, but I caught the trailing bridle and held firm. Within an hour, I was mounted.

The horse changed everything. On foot, I could cover perhaps fifteen miles in a day. On horseback, even on this sorry creature, I could do three times that. More importantly, I could outrun pursuit. The Deshmukh's hunters were mounted on fine horses, but fine horses tire faster than they think. A determined rider on an inferior mount, willing to push through the night, can outpace them.

I pushed through many nights.

Aurangabad rose out of the Deccan like a fever dream.

I had heard stories of the old Mughal capital, but nothing had prepared me for the reality. The walls stretched for miles, enclosing a city that had once housed emperors. The Bibi Ka Maqbara gleamed white against the brown hills - a pale imitation of the Taj Mahal, they said, built by a prince for his mother. The streets teemed with people of every kind: Marathas and Mughals, Hindus and Muslims, merchants and soldiers and beggars and thieves.

In a city this size, I thought, a man could disappear.

I sold the horse at the first stable I found. The stableman cheated me - I could see it in his eyes - but I did not argue. I needed the money, and I needed to be rid of an animal that might be traced. With the coins in my pocket, I went looking for a place to hide.

I found it in the warrens near the southern gate: a district of cheap lodging houses, gambling dens, and establishments that asked no questions. The landlord of the first place I tried looked at my wrapped head and named a price twice what the room was worth. I paid it. Privacy, I was learning, came at a premium.

The room was barely larger than a closet, with a straw pallet on the floor and a window that looked out on an alley. It smelled of mould and old sweat. It was, at that moment, the most beautiful place I had ever seen.

I locked the door, unwrapped the cloth from my head, and slept for sixteen hours straight.

---

Aurangabad should have been safe. The city was under the Nizam's authority, not the Marathas'. The Deshmukh's writ did not run here. I could find work, perhaps, in the stables or the caravanserais. I could wait until the hunt died down, then continue south.

That was the plan. It was not a good plan.

On my third day in the city, I went to a chai stall near the market. I kept my head wrapped, my eyes down, my voice low. I ordered tea and a flatbread and sat in a corner where I could watch the street.

Two men came in while I was eating. Maratha men, by their dress and their accents. They ordered chai and stood by the counter, talking loudly enough for everyone to hear.

"The Deshmukh has offered a hundred gold mohurs," one of them said. "A hundred! For the man who killed his son."

"Dead or alive?" the other asked.

"Alive, if possible. The Deshmukh wants to kill him himself. But dead is acceptable. The brand makes him easy to identify."

I did not move. I did not breathe. The flatbread turned to ash in my mouth.

"They say he fled south," the first man continued. "Toward the Nizam's territory. The Deshmukh has sent word to every village between here and Bijapur. Anyone who finds the Brahmin-killer will be rewarded. Anyone who shelters him will be punished."

"A hundred mohurs," the second man said, shaking his head. "That's enough to buy a farm. A house. A new life."

"The Deshmukh loved his son. They say the young man's widow is with child. The Deshmukh's grandchild, who will never know its father."

I stood up slowly, leaving my tea half-finished, and walked out of the stall. I did not run. Running would draw attention. I walked, steadily and calmly, back to my room in the warrens.

Then I locked the door and sat in the darkness, trying to calculate how much time I had left.

---

A hundred gold mohurs. The number kept circling in my mind.

That was a fortune. More than most men would see in a lifetime. For that kind of money, people would do anything. Turn in a stranger. Betray a friend. The landlord who had rented me this room - would he sell me if he knew? The stableman who had bought my horse - had he already guessed what I was?

The Deshmukh's grief had become a weapon. His gold would do what his hunters could not: it would turn every eye in the Deccan toward me. Wherever I went, whatever I did, there would always be someone willing to collect the reward.

I could not stay in Aurangabad. I could not stay anywhere for long. I had to keep moving, keep ahead of the word spreading outward from Sangamner like ripples in a pool.

But where could I go? The Deshmukh had sent word to every village between here and Bijapur. That meant the direct route south was blocked. I would have to go around - east, perhaps, through territories where the name of the Deshmukh meant less. Or west, toward the coast, where I might find a ship.

No. Not west. Not east. South. Always south. Travancore was south, and Travancore was where my father had told me to go.

I unfolded his letter and read it again in the fading light from the window.

*Go to him. Show him this letter. Show him the knife. Tell him that Dhanaji asks him to remember old debts.*

Old debts. My father had believed that this man, this Ananthan Pillai, would honour a debt incurred decades ago, in a war I had never seen. He had believed it enough to stake my life on it.

Perhaps he was right. Perhaps Ananthan Pillai would remember Dhanaji and take pity on his son.

Or perhaps he would see the brand on my forehead and turn me away. Perhaps he would collect the Deshmukh's reward himself. Perhaps my father's faith was misplaced, and I would die in a strange land, far from everything I knew.

I did not know. I could not know. But I had nowhere else to go.

---

I left Aurangabad before dawn, slipping out through a gap in the southern wall where the stones had crumbled. I had spent most of my remaining money on supplies: dried food, a water skin, a knife that was not the jeweled blade but would serve for utility and defence. The jeweled knife I kept hidden, wrapped in cloth at the bottom of my pack. It was too distinctive to use, too valuable to sell. It was my proof, my father's token, my only hope of being believed.

The road south stretched before me, winding through brown hills and dry riverbeds. Somewhere beyond those hills lay the Carnatic, and beyond that, the kingdoms of the deep south. Travancore. Ananthan Pillai. The chance my father had died to give me.

Behind me, the Deshmukh's hunters would be stirring, asking their questions, spreading their gold. A hundred mohurs for the Brahmin-killer. A fortune for my head.

I pulled the cloth tighter around my forehead and began to walk.

The sun rose at my back, casting my shadow long before me. Three ghosts walked in that shadow: Pandit Raghunath Bhat, Vikram, my father. They would walk with me all the way to Travancore, I knew. They would walk with me until the day I died.

But that day was not today. Today, I walked toward the south, toward a name on a letter, toward the faintest hope of redemption.

The hunters were coming. Let them come. I had nothing left to lose but a life that was not worth living.

Perhaps, in Travancore, I could find a way to make it worth something again.

---

*The Deccan stretched before me, vast and indifferent to my passage. I was a murderer fleeing justice. I was a son carrying his father's dying wish. I was a creature with his shame burned into his face, running from a grief that would never stop hunting him.*

*A hundred gold mohurs. That was my price. That was what the Deshmukh thought his son was worth.*

*He was wrong, of course. His son had been worth more than all the gold in the world. I knew that. I had taken that worth and destroyed it, for a handful of silver coins that I no longer even possessed.*

*But I kept walking anyway. Because my father had asked me to. Because it was the only direction left.*

*I kept walking anyway, because stopping was surrender, and surrender was the one thing my father had died to prevent.*
