# Chapter 9: Earning the Saddle

The riders came at dawn.

I was in the stable, preparing feed for the horses, when the first shout cut through the compound. Then the clash of steel. Then a horse screaming, a sound so human it turned my stomach. I dropped the bucket and ran to the stable door.

The courtyard was a churn of mud and hooves and men. A dozen horsemen had broken through the outer gate and ridden straight into Revathi's compound, their faces wrapped like bandits, their blades already wet. Two of the household guards were down near the gate - one motionless, the other dragging himself towards the well with his hand pressed hard to his side. The rest were scrambling to form a defence, but they were scattered, unprepared, overwhelmed by the speed of it.

"Find him!" one of the riders shouted in Marathi. "The branded one. Take him alive!"

So it was not a raid for horses or grain. It was the hunt, crossing the Ghats to sniff me out.

Kesava Pillai was in the centre of the courtyard, sword in hand, shouting orders. He had already killed one attacker; the man lay crumpled at his feet. But more were coming, circling him like wolves, probing for weakness and looking past him towards the house.

I should have stayed in the stable. I was a servant, not a soldier. I had no armour, no right to carry a blade in this place.

But if they reached the stables, they would drag me north in chains, if they did not kill me where I stood. And if the compound fell, Revathi would die, and my chance would die with her.

I grabbed a pitchfork from the wall and ran into the chaos.

---

The first man did not see me coming.

He was angling towards the main house, watching Kesava, when I came up behind him and drove the pitchfork into his horse's flank. The iron bit deep. The animal screamed and reared, throwing its rider. Before he could recover, I was on him, the pitchfork reversed, the wooden shaft cracking against his skull.

He went down. He did not get up.

I did not stop to think about what I had done. I grabbed his sword - a decent blade, better than a pitchfork - and looked for the next threat.

The fight had become a swirling melee. Revathi's guards were rallying now, forming a line near the main house. The raiders had lost the element of surprise, and their numbers were not enough to press the advantage. But they were desperate men, fighting with the ferocity of those who had nothing to lose.

I moved through it on instinct. I was not a trained soldier - not yet - but my father had taught my hands what to do, and the long road south had taught me what hesitation costs.

A man turned to face me, his scarf slipping, his mouth open to shout. I stepped inside his swing and cut him down before he could finish the breath.

Another tried to flee back through the gate. I slashed at his horse's hind leg as he passed. The animal buckled, screaming, and the rider went down hard. The guards finished him.

A third came at me directly, his blade singing through the air. I parried, felt the jolt up my arm, let the steel slide, and stepped in close. I found my opening and opened his throat before he could strike again.

When it was over, I stood in the courtyard with blood on my hands and bodies at my feet. The surviving men were fleeing through the broken gate, pursued by mounted guards. The attack had failed.

I looked down at the sword in my hand. The blade was red. My arms were shaking.

Three more deaths. Three more ghosts to add to my collection.

But these had been killers, raiders, men who would have murdered everyone in this compound without hesitation. This blood was different.

Wasn't it?

---

Kesava Pillai found me as the guards were securing the compound.

He was wounded - a cut on his arm, shallow but bleeding freely - but he moved with the same controlled energy I had seen in him before. His eyes found me among the chaos, tracked the blood on my clothes, the sword still clutched in my hand.

"You killed three of them," he said. It was not a question.

"Yes."

"You should have stayed in the stable. This was not your fight."

"If the compound fell, I would have died anyway."

He considered this for a moment. I waited for the contempt, the dismissal, the reminder that I was nothing but a criminal who had gotten lucky.

Instead, he said: "Where did you learn to fight like that?"

"My father taught me. Before the opium. Before everything."

"Your father was a cavalry rider."

"Yes."

Kesava nodded slowly. "You fight like one. The way you moved, the way you read the battle - that is not stable hand work. That is training."

For a moment, the courtyard noise fell away and all I could hear was the blood in my ears. Praise from Kesava Pillai felt like being struck. I could only nod, because any words I tried to form came out crooked.

"My grandmother will want to speak with you," he said finally. "Clean yourself up. And find a proper sword - that one is too heavy for you."

He turned and walked toward the main house, calling orders to his men. I stood in the bloody courtyard, trying to understand what had just happened.

Revathi received me in her study that afternoon.

The room was smaller than I expected, lined with books and scrolls in languages I could not read. She sat behind a desk of carved teak, her white sari immaculate despite the chaos of the morning. Her eyes tracked me as I entered, noting the fresh clothes I had borrowed, the cuts and bruises I had collected.

"Sit," she said.

I sat.

"My grandson tells me you killed three men this morning. He tells me you fought well - better than some of the guards who are paid to protect this household."

"I did what was necessary."

"So it seems." She studied me for a long moment. "When I took you in, I saw something in you. Survival instinct. The desperate cunning of a man who has nothing left to lose. But I did not expect this. I did not expect a stable hand to become a warrior overnight."

"I was not always a stable hand."

"No. You were your father's son before you were anything else. He trained you, I imagine. In the cavalry arts, the way of the sword, the skills that make a Maratha horseman worth fearing."

"Yes."

"And then you threw it all away for opium and silver coins." Her voice was flat, without judgment. "But the training remained. Buried under years of waste, perhaps, but still there."

I said nothing. She was right. The training had remained, sleeping beneath the surface of my addiction, waiting for the moment when I would need it again.

"I have a use for you," Revathi said. "My household guard is capable, but it lacks depth. Kesava leads them well, but he cannot be everywhere. I need men who can fight - men whose loyalty is to me, not to the kingdom or the old aristocracy."

"You want me to join your guard?"

"I want you to earn the right to join my guard." She rose from behind the desk. "You will begin training with Kesava tomorrow. You will learn our methods, our tactics, our discipline. You will prove yourself in the small tasks before you are trusted with the large ones."

"Kesava will not want this. He has made his opinion of me clear."

"Kesava will do as I tell him. And you will give him no excuse to complain." She walked to the window, looking out at the courtyard where the guards were still cleaning up from the attack. "This morning, you were a stable hand. Tomorrow, you will be the lowest rank in my household guard. It is not much, but it is a step."

"Why?" I asked. "Why give me this chance? You do not know if I can be trusted. You do not know if I will betray you."

Revathi turned back to face me. "I do not know, no. But I have learned, over many years, that men are not fixed things. They change. They grow. They become more than they were, or less, depending on the choices they make and the chances they are given." She smiled - a thin, cool expression that did not quite reach her eyes. "I am giving you a chance. What you do with it is up to you."

She dismissed me with a wave of her hand. I rose and walked to the door.

"One more thing," she said as I reached the threshold. "The brand on your forehead. You cannot hide it, and you should not try. Let the guards see it. Let them know what you were. And then show them what you are becoming."

I nodded and left.

That night, I lay in my quarters - still the same small room, still the servant's pallet - and thought about what had happened.

In a single morning, I had killed three men and risen from stable hand to trainee guard. It was more progress than I had made in months. More hope than I had felt since Sangamner.

But I could not shake the memory of the blood on my hands. The weight of the sword. The sound the third rider had made as my blade opened his throat.

The old thought came, uninvited and intimate: smoke would soften this. Opium would make the ghosts quieter.

I had told myself that these deaths were different. That killing armed men sent to drag me north was not the same as killing a priest, a nobleman's son. That this blood was justified, necessary, clean.

But was it? Or was I simply finding new reasons to do what I had always done - destroy, and run, and pretend that the destruction was not my fault?

The three ghosts from Sangamner did not answer. But I felt them watching, waiting, wondering what I would become.

Tomorrow, I would begin training with Kesava. Tomorrow, I would start earning a place in Revathi's guard. Tomorrow, the real work would begin.

Tonight, I lay awake and listened to the ghosts.

*The brand on my forehead said* brahman-hatyara. *Nothing I did would ever erase those letters. Nothing I achieved would ever undo what I had done in that temple, on that night, in that darkness.*

*But perhaps - perhaps - I could add to the story. Perhaps I could become more than the sum of my crimes. Perhaps the words burned into my flesh did not have to be the final words spoken about me.*

*Revathi had given me a chance. De Lannoy had shown me that transformation was possible. And this morning, in the blood and chaos of the courtyard, I had discovered that my father's training had not been lost.*

*It was not redemption. It was not forgiveness. But it was a beginning.*

*I closed my eyes and tried to sleep. Tomorrow would come whether I was ready or not.*

*Tomorrow, I would start earning the saddle.*
