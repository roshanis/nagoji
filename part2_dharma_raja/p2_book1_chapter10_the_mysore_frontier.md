# Chapter 10: The Mysore Frontier

The northern border was a wound that would not heal.

I rode there for the first time six months after the bandit attack, part of a patrol sent to survey the frontier posts and report on conditions. Kesava led the patrol - a dozen men, mounted and armed, carrying the banner of Revathi's household. I rode at the rear, as befitted my rank, but I rode.

It was the first time I had been on a horse since arriving in Travancore. The first time I had worn a sword at my hip as a soldier rather than a fugitive. The first time I had felt, however briefly, like my father's son.

The training had been brutal. Kesava had driven me harder than any of the other recruits, finding fault where there was none, demanding perfection where adequacy would have sufficed. I had borne it without complaint, as I had borne everything else. And slowly, grudgingly, he had begun to acknowledge that I was not entirely useless.

"You ride well," he had said one morning, watching me put a horse through its paces in the training yard. It was the closest thing to praise I had ever heard from him.

"My father taught me," I replied.

"Your father taught you many things, it seems. It is a pity you forgot most of them when you needed them most."

That was Kesava. Every acknowledgment came wrapped in a reminder of what I was. But I was learning to accept even that. The brand on my forehead was reminder enough; I did not need Kesava to tell me what I had been.

What mattered was what I was becoming.

The border country was unlike anything I had seen in Travancore.

The lush green of the coast gave way to drier lands as we rode north - still fertile, still dotted with rice paddies and coconut groves, but with an edge to it, a tension that the southern territories lacked. The villages here were fortified, their walls thick and their gates strong. The people watched us pass with wary eyes, neither welcoming nor hostile, simply waiting.

"They have seen too many armies," one of the older guards told me. His name was Govindan, a veteran of twenty years who had fought in the wars against the Dutch and the small kingdoms that Marthanda Varma had absorbed. "Mysore raids. Maratha incursions. Even the Nairs from the old kingdoms, before Travancore united them. These people have learned that soldiers mean trouble, whatever banner they carry."

"And us? Do we mean trouble?"

"We mean protection. But protection has a cost, and the cost is paid in taxes and levies and young men taken for the army." He shrugged. "They tolerate us because the alternative is worse. That is the best any kingdom can hope for."

I thought about that as we rode. The Deshmukh's lands had been like this too - peasants who endured whoever ruled them, bending with the wind, surviving as best they could. The great ones fought their wars, and the small ones paid the price.

It had never mattered to me before. Now, wearing a soldier's sword and riding under a noble's banner, I began to understand what it meant to be one of the great ones. And I wondered if I could ever be worthy of the power that came with it.

We reached the frontier post on the third day.

It was a small fort, barely more than a watchtower with a wall around it, perched on a hill overlooking the road north. A dozen soldiers manned it, their uniforms faded and their equipment worn but serviceable. They saluted Kesava as we approached and made room for us in their cramped quarters.

"Quiet month," the post commander reported. He was a weathered man in his forties, missing an ear - lost, he said, to a Mysorean saber years ago. "No raids. No incursions. But the refugees keep coming."

"Refugees?" Kesava asked.

"From the north. From the territories Hyder Ali has taken." The commander gestured toward the road. "Every few days, another group arrives. Farmers. Merchants. Families with nothing left but what they can carry. They say Mysore is swallowing everything."

"And what do you do with them?"

"Send them south. What else can we do? We do not have the resources to feed them here, and they cannot go back." He shook his head. "But each group brings stories. Stories of what Hyder Ali is building. And the stories grow darker with each telling."

I saw the refugees the next morning.

There were perhaps fifty of them, a straggling column of exhausted humanity making their way along the road toward Travancore. Men and women, children and elders, carrying bundles of possessions and leading whatever livestock they had managed to save. Their clothes were torn, their faces hollow with hunger and fear.

I rode out to meet them with a small escort. Kesava had ordered it - a show of Travancore's authority, a reminder that they were entering a kingdom that would not be overrun as easily as their homes had been.

An old man at the head of the column stopped when he saw us. He looked at our horses, our weapons, the banner we carried. Something like hope flickered in his eyes.

"You are Travancore soldiers?"

"We are."

"Then we are safe." He said it like a prayer, like a man who had stopped believing in safety and was trying to remember what the word meant. "They told us Travancore would take us in. They told us the southern kingdoms still stand."

"Travancore stands," I said. "You are welcome here."

The old man began to weep. Others in the column followed - a wave of relief and grief and exhaustion washing over them. They had been running for so long, and now, finally, they had found a place that would not run from them.

I dismounted and helped them organize their march. I shared what food we had. I listened to their stories.

And the stories were terrible.

Hyder Ali had been busy.

The refugees spoke of an army unlike anything the south had seen - infantry trained in the European style, cavalry that struck like lightning, artillery that could reduce a fort to rubble in hours. They spoke of rockets, iron tubes that screamed through the air and burst into flame among the enemy ranks. They spoke of discipline, of logistics, of a war machine that ground forward without mercy or hesitation.

"He took our village in a single day," one man told me. He was a farmer, his hands still calloused from the plow, his eyes still haunted by what he had seen. "We had walls. We had men to defend them. It did not matter. His cannons broke the walls before noon, and his soldiers were inside before we could even think of surrendering."

"Did they kill everyone?"

"No. That is the strange thing. He wants people, not corpses. He wants farmers to work his lands, craftsmen to build his weapons, young men to fill his armies. He did not destroy us - he absorbed us." The farmer shook his head. "Those who resisted died. Those who submitted became Mysoreans. There was no middle ground."

I thought of the Carnatic, of the Nawab who had become a puppet of the English. I thought of the Deccan, where Marathas and Nizam fought endless wars over territories that changed hands with the seasons. And I thought of Travancore, this small kingdom on the southern tip of India, standing in the path of a storm that was only beginning to gather.

"Will he come here?" I asked.

The farmer looked at me with something like pity. "He will come everywhere, eventually. That is what they say. Hyder Ali wants to rule the south - all of it. The only question is when."

That night, I stood on the walls of the frontier post and looked north.

The road stretched into darkness, winding through hills and forests toward lands I had never seen. Somewhere beyond those hills, Hyder Ali was building his empire. Somewhere beyond those hills, the storm was gathering that might sweep away everything Travancore had built.

I had come here as a fugitive, a murderer, a man with nothing left to lose. I had been given a chance - by Revathi's mercy, by De Lannoy's wisdom, by the endless patience of those who had chosen to see something in me worth saving. And now I was a soldier, however junior, however untested. I wore Travancore's colors. I carried Travancore's sword.

The brand on my forehead still burned in the cool night air. The three ghosts still walked beside me. But standing on that wall, looking out at the darkness that threatened to swallow everything, I felt something I had not felt in a long time.

Purpose.

Not redemption - I had not earned that, might never earn it. Not forgiveness - the dead did not forgive, and the living had no right to offer absolution on their behalf. But purpose. A reason to wake each morning. A direction to walk that was not simply away from my past.

Travancore faced an enemy greater than any it had ever known. The kingdom that had broken the Dutch now stood in the path of a conqueror who made the Dutch look like merchants playing at war. The years ahead would be hard - harder, perhaps, than any in Travancore's history.

And I would be there. Not as a hero - I was not a hero, had never been, might never be. But as a sword in the darkness. As one more body on the walls. As a man who had been given a chance and was determined not to waste it.

The banner of Travancore flew above my head, snapping in the night wind. I looked up at it and made a silent promise.

I would earn this. I would become worthy of the chance I had been given. And when the storm came - when Hyder Ali or his successors turned their eyes toward the south - I would be ready.

It was not much of a promise. I was still a murderer. I was still a criminal. The brand on my forehead would never fade, and the ghosts would never stop following me.

But it was a beginning. And beginnings, I was learning, were more than most men ever received.
