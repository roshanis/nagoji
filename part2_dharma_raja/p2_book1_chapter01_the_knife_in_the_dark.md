# Chapter 1: The Knife in the Dark

I will tell you what I was, because you need to understand what I became.

I was twenty years old the night I killed the priest. Twenty years old and already a ruin - a husk of a man hollowed out by the black paste that I smoked in the dens of Sangamner. Opium. The word sounds almost gentle. It was not gentle. It was a god that demanded everything and gave nothing back but the need for more.

My father was Dhanaji, a cavalry rider who had served with honour in the wars of the south. He had ridden beside a man named Nagoji Sawant, and together they had done things worth remembering. My father came home with stories and a jeweled knife and the respect of men who had seen him fight. He married. He raised a son. He watched that son become something he could not recognise.

I do not remember when the opium first found me, or I found it. I remember only that at some point it became the only thing that mattered. I sold my horse. I sold my sword. I sold the gold chain my mother had left me when she died. When there was nothing left to sell, I began to steal.

That night - the night that ended my old life and began whatever this is - I needed money. The craving was a fire in my bones, a voice that drowned out all other voices. I had not smoked in two days. My hands shook. My skin crawled with invisible insects. I could not think of anything except the relief that waited in the den, if only I had silver to pay for it.

The temple stood at the edge of the village, a small shrine to Hanuman with a brass lamp that burned through the night. I knew the pujari kept the offerings in a locked box behind the idol. I knew he slept in a small room at the back. I knew, because I had been watching for three days, that he was old and moved slowly and would not hear me if I was careful.

I was not careful enough.

---

The lock broke easily under my knife - not the jeweled one my father kept, but a cheap blade I had stolen from a market stall. The box was heavier than I expected, filled with copper coins and a few pieces of silver. Enough. Enough for a week, maybe more if I was careful. I turned to leave.

The pujari stood in the doorway.

Pandit Raghunath Bhat. The man who had tied the first thread around my wrist at my naming and pressed sugar into my mouth with his own fingers.

He was older than I remembered, white-haired and thin, wearing only a dhoti. His eyes moved from my face to the broken box to the scattered coins at my feet. He did not scream. He did not run. He simply looked at me with an expression I did not understand then but understand now.

Disappointment. Not fear. Disappointment.

"Dhanaji's son," he said. "I remember when your father brought you here for your naming ceremony."

I do not know what I would have done if he had screamed. Perhaps I would have run. Perhaps I would have surrendered. But those quiet words - Dhanaji's son - they cut something loose in me. Shame. Rage. The desperate need of an addict who sees his fix slipping away.

I hit him with the box. I did not mean to kill him. I meant only to get past him, to escape with the silver, to find my way to the den where the black paste waited. But the corner of the box caught his temple, and he fell, and there was blood on the stone floor, and he did not get up.

I stood over him, breathing hard, the coins scattered around my feet. The lamp flame flickered. The brass face of Hanuman watched me with eyes that saw everything.

I should have run then. I should have taken what I could carry and disappeared into the night. But I stood frozen, staring at the blood spreading beneath the old man's head, and that is how the Deshmukh's son found me.

---

His name was Vikram. I learned that later, at the trial. I learned that he was twenty-three years old, recently married, that his wife was pregnant with their first child. I learned that he had been walking home from a feast at a neighbour's house when he heard the sound of the lock breaking. I learned that he was known for his courage, his sense of duty, his belief that a man should act when others stood idle.

He was everything I was not.

He came through the door with a torch in one hand and a staff in the other, and he saw me standing over the body of the pujari with blood on my hands and silver coins at my feet. He did not hesitate. He raised the staff and came for me.

I do not remember the fight clearly. I remember the torch falling, scattering sparks across the stone floor. I remember the staff cracking against my shoulder, the pain bright and hot. I remember my knife - the cheap stolen blade - finding his chest. Once. Twice. Three times.

He fell beside the pujari. Two bodies now. Two pools of blood merging into one.

I ran.

---

They caught me before dawn.

I had made it perhaps two miles, stumbling through fields and across streams, before the village men found me hiding in a drainage ditch. I was too weak from opium sickness to fight. Too weak to run any further. They dragged me back to Sangamner, and they threw me in a room with a locked door, and they left me there to shake and sweat and vomit while they decided what to do with me.

The trial, if you could call it that, lasted less than an hour.

The Deshmukh himself presided - Vikram's father, a hard-faced man with grey in his beard and grief carved into every line of his face. He listened to the witnesses. He examined the knife, still crusted with his son's blood. He looked at me - this wretched, trembling creature who had murdered a priest and his only son - and he pronounced the sentence.

Death. But not yet.

First, they would mark me. So that everyone who saw me, in this life or any other, would know what I was.

---

They held me down in the courtyard of the Deshmukh's house. Four men on my arms and legs, a fifth holding my head steady. The smith came with his iron - a brand made specially for this purpose, the Devanagari letters reversed so they would read correctly on flesh.

I screamed. I am not ashamed to say it. I screamed as the hot iron pressed against my forehead, as the smell of my own burning flesh filled my nostrils, as the letters were seared into my skin forever.

*Brahman-hatyara.* Brahmin-killer.

When they released me, I could not stand. I lay in the dirt, whimpering, while the Deshmukh stood over me and spoke words I barely heard through the haze of pain.

"Tomorrow at dawn, you will die. Tonight, you will wait, and you will think about what you have done."

They dragged me to a wooden post in the centre of the village and chained me there. The villagers came to look at me - the monster, the temple robber, the murderer of priests and young men. Some spat. Some threw stones. Most simply stared at the fresh brand on my forehead, the letters still weeping fluid, and turned away in disgust.

I waited for dawn. I waited for death. I almost welcomed it.

And then my father came.

---

I did not see him at first. I was drifting in and out of consciousness, my forehead a constant pulse of agony, my body shaking with the sickness of withdrawal. The night had grown quiet. The villagers had gone to their beds. Even my guards dozed at their posts.

Then a hand touched my face, and I opened my eyes, and Dhanaji was there.

He looked old. Older than I remembered, though I had seen him only a month before. His hair was grey, his face lined with grief, his eyes red from weeping or sleeplessness or both. He had a knife in his hand - not the jeweled blade, but a practical weapon, the kind a soldier carries.

"Be quiet," he whispered. "Do not speak. Do not make a sound."

He produced a key - stolen, no doubt, from a guard's belt - and worked it into the padlock. There was a soft click. The chains fell away, and I was free, and my father pulled me to my feet.

"Can you walk?"

I could barely stand. But I nodded.

"Then walk. Follow me. Do not look back."

We made it perhaps fifty steps before the guards woke.

---

I do not know who raised the alarm. I do not know if my father had a plan beyond getting me out of those chains. I know only that suddenly there were shouts behind us, torches flaring to life, the sound of running feet.

"Go," my father said. "Run. Do not stop until you reach the river."

"Come with me-"

"I will hold them. Go."

"Father-"

He turned to face the men who were coming. Four of them, five, more emerging from the darkness with weapons in their hands. The Deshmukh was among them, his grief transformed into fury, his sword already drawn.

"GO!"

I ran.

I ran, and behind me I heard the sounds of fighting. Steel on steel. Shouts. A cry of pain that might have been my father's voice or might have been someone else's. I did not look back. He had told me not to look back.

I reached the river. I crossed it. I kept running.

When dawn came, I stopped at the edge of a forest and turned to look at the village I had fled. Smoke rose from somewhere near the centre - perhaps a torch had been dropped, perhaps a fire had been lit deliberately. I could not see what had happened. I did not need to see.

My father was dead. I knew it with a certainty that went beyond knowledge. He had died fighting, holding off the men who would have killed me, giving me time to escape. He had traded his life for mine.

Dhanaji, who had ridden with honour in the wars of the south. Dhanaji, who had been a hero. Dhanaji, who had deserved a better son.

Dead, because of me.

---

I made my way back to my father's house by a roundabout path, moving at night, hiding during the day. The brand on my forehead made it impossible to show my face - everyone who saw those letters would know what I was. I wrapped my head in cloth, told the few people I encountered that I had been burned in an accident. Some believed me. Some did not. None tried to stop me.

The house was empty when I arrived. Word of my father's death had not yet reached here, or perhaps it had and the servants had fled. I moved through the rooms like a ghost, touching the things he had touched, sitting in the chair where he had sat.

I found the knife in its usual place, in a wooden box beside his bed. The jeweled blade that Nagoji Sawant had given him, years ago, in a kingdom I had never seen. I took it. I had no right to it, but I took it anyway.

I found the letter beneath the knife.

It was addressed to no one, but it was clearly meant for me. My father's handwriting, steady and clear, the words of a man who had perhaps always known this day would come.

*My son,*

*If you are reading this, then I am gone, and you are in trouble deeper than I can help you from. I do not know what you have done. I do not know if you can be saved. But I know that every man deserves one chance to become something other than his worst moment.*

*There is a man in Travancore named Ananthan Pillai. Once, he was called Nagoji Sawant. Once, he was a prisoner, a broken thing, a man with nothing left to lose. He became something else. He became my friend.*

*Go to him. Show him this letter. Show him the knife. Tell him that Dhanaji asks him to remember old debts.*

*I do not know if he will help you. I do not know if anyone can help you. But if there is any hope for you, my son, it lies in the south. It lies in Travancore.*

*Do not waste this chance. Do not waste my death.*

*Your father,*
*Dhanaji*

I sat in his empty house and read those words until I had memorized them. Then I folded the letter, placed it inside my shirt, and rose to leave.

The sun was setting. I had a long way to go. Behind me lay everything I had destroyed - the priest, the Deshmukh's son, my father. Ahead lay a name I did not know, a kingdom I had never seen, and the faintest possibility that I might someday become something other than my worst moment.

I did not believe it. Not then. But I went anyway.

What else was there to do?

---

*Three deaths I carried with me out of Sangamner. Three ghosts that would walk beside me for the rest of my life. Pandit Raghunath Bhat, who had once blessed me and whom I killed for coins. Vikram, the Deshmukh's son, who had only tried to do what was right. And my father, who had loved me despite everything, who had died so that I might live.*

*The brand on my forehead would never heal. The letters would never fade. Wherever I went, whatever I became, I would wear my shame for all to see.*

*Brahman-hatyara.*

*Some things cannot be undone. Some stains cannot be washed clean. I know that now. I knew it then.*

*But I went south anyway. Because my father had asked me to. Because it was the only direction left.*

*Because even the worst of men, in the darkest of moments, can still put one foot in front of the other and walk toward something they cannot see.*
