# Chapter 11: De Lannoy's Funeral

The old Dutchman died in the spring of 1777.

I heard the news from Govindan, who had heard it from a messenger passing through the compound. Eustachius De Lannoy, commander of Udayagiri Fort, architect of Travancore's military power, had died peacefully in his sleep. He was seventy-two years old. He had served three kings and built an army that had humbled the Dutch and held the borders against a dozen enemies.

Now he was gone, and Travancore would bury him with honors.

Revathi ordered a delegation from her household to attend the funeral. Kesava would lead it, as befitted his rank, but she included me among the guards who would accompany him. I did not ask why. Perhaps she remembered that I had met De Lannoy, that he had spoken to me in that small chapel with the colored windows. Perhaps she simply needed bodies to fill out the procession.

Either way, I rode to Udayagiri for the second time, carrying a very different burden than before.

The fort was transformed.

Where I had seen soldiers drilling and horses stamping, I now saw mourning. Black cloth hung from the walls. The cannon stood silent, their mouths covered. Officers and men alike wore bands of white on their arms - the southern color of grief, though De Lannoy himself had been born to a people who mourned in black.

The contradictions were everywhere. A Christian funeral in a Hindu kingdom. A Dutch commander buried in Indian soil. European prayers spoken alongside Malayalam hymns. Travancore had taken De Lannoy and made him its own, but it had not erased what he had been - it had simply added to it, layer upon layer, until he became something that belonged to no single world.

I understood, now, what he had meant when he said he had become something new. Not Dutch. Not Travancorean. Something that had not existed before.

The chapel where we had spoken was full to bursting. I stood at the back with the other guards, watching as the great and powerful of Travancore paid their respects. Raja Kesavadas was there, the Dalawa himself, representing the king. Officers from every regiment. Nobles from a dozen houses. And at the front, in the places of highest honor, two men I had not seen before.

De Lannoy's sons.

---

Hendrik was the elder, perhaps forty years old, with his father's height and his mother's coloring - a complexion that spoke of mixed heritage, neither European nor fully Indian. He wore the uniform of a Travancore artillery officer, the same uniform his father had designed, and he stood with the rigid bearing of a man who had spent his life in military service.

Caspar was younger, perhaps thirty, and everything his brother was not. Where Hendrik was controlled, Caspar was restless - shifting from foot to foot, his eyes darting around the chapel, his hands never quite still. He wore civilian clothes rather than uniform, and there was something in his face that spoke of dissipation, of nights spent in ways that daylight would not approve.

I watched them through the ceremony, these sons of the legendary commander. They had been born in Travancore, raised in the shadow of their father's achievements, shaped by a legacy that few men could hope to equal. And now that legacy was being lowered into the ground, and they would have to find their own way forward.

I knew something about that. About living in the shadow of a father. About trying to become worthy of a name you had inherited.

The difference was that their father had died a hero. Mine had died saving a criminal from the justice he deserved.

---

The ceremony blended traditions in ways I had never seen.

A Catholic priest spoke the Latin words of committal, his voice echoing off the stone walls. Then a Brahmin chanted Sanskrit verses, blessing the soul of a man who had never been Hindu but who had served Hindu kings. Then the soldiers of Udayagiri fired a salute, European style, the crack of muskets splitting the morning air.

When it was done, they lowered De Lannoy into a grave beside the altar where he had knelt in prayer. The tombstone was already carved, bearing his name and titles in both Dutch and Malayalam:

EUSTACHIUS BENEDICTUS DE LANNOY
Commander of Udayagiri
Servant of Travancore
1705-1777

Servant of Travancore. That was how he had wanted to be remembered. Not as a conqueror or a prisoner, not as a Dutchman or a convert, but as a servant. A man who had found his place and filled it faithfully until the end.

I thought of what he had told me in this very chapel. *Hearts can change, even when the flesh cannot.* He had been speaking to me, but he had also been speaking about himself - about the long journey from Dutch commander to Travancorean legend.

He had made that journey. He had earned his tombstone. And now he was gone, leaving only the fort he had built and the army he had trained and the sons who would carry his name forward.

I hoped I would be worthy of the chance he had helped give me. I suspected I would never be certain.

After the ceremony, there was a reception in the fort's main hall.

I should not have been there - I was a guard, meant to stand at the edges and watch for trouble - but Kesava gestured for me to follow him as he paid his respects to De Lannoy's sons. I did not understand why until we reached them.

"Captain Hendrik," Kesava said, offering a formal bow. "My grandmother sends her condolences. Your father was a great man. Travancore will not see his like again."

Hendrik returned the bow with military precision. "Thank your grandmother for her words. My father spoke highly of Revathi Bayi. He said she was one of the few nobles who understood what he was trying to build."

"He was generous in his praise."

"He was honest in his assessments. That is not always the same thing." Hendrik's eyes moved past Kesava to where I stood. "And this is?"

"One of my grandmother's guards. He met your father some time ago, in the chapel. My grandmother thought he should be here."

Hendrik studied me with the same assessing gaze his father had used. His eyes moved to the brand on my forehead, read the letters there, returned to my face.

"You are the Maratha. The one my father mentioned in his letters."

I had not known De Lannoy had written about me. "I only spoke with him once."

"Once was enough, it seems. He wrote that he had met a man who reminded him of himself - a man who had come to Travancore as wreckage and might yet become something more." Hendrik's expression did not change. "He saw potential in unlikely places. It was one of his gifts."

"Your father was kind to me. Kinder than I deserved."

"My father was never kind without purpose. If he spoke to you, it was because he believed you might be useful." Hendrik glanced at his brother, who had wandered off to find a drink. "Caspar could learn something from that. From being useful."

There was an edge in his voice - old frustration, old disappointment. I recognized it from the way Kesava spoke to me sometimes. The weariness of watching someone fail to live up to their potential.

"I am sorry for your loss," I said. It was inadequate, but it was all I had.

"Thank you." Hendrik turned back to Kesava. "If your grandmother ever has need of artillery support, she knows where to find me. My father built the guns that guard this kingdom. I intend to keep them ready."

---

I found Caspar later, alone on the walls, drinking from a bottle he had taken from the reception.

He did not seem surprised to see me. He did not seem surprised by anything - his eyes had the glazed look of a man who had been drinking for hours, or perhaps for years.

"The branded man," he said, raising his bottle in mock salute. "My father's project. His last attempt to prove that broken things can be fixed."

"I did not know I was anyone's project."

"Everything was a project to him. The forts. The cannons. The soldiers. Even his sons." Caspar laughed bitterly. "Hendrik was a success. I was a failure. The balance sheet of Eustachius De Lannoy."

"I am sorry for your loss," I said again.

"Are you? Or are you just saying the words because they are expected?" He took a long drink. "I cannot tell anymore. I have heard so many condolences today, all of them sincere, none of them real. No one knew him. Not really. They knew the legend. They knew the commander. They did not know the man who sat alone in that chapel every night, talking to a God he was not sure he believed in anymore."

I did not know how to respond. I had met De Lannoy only once, and Caspar was right - I had not known him. I had known only what he had chosen to show me.

"He told me that hearts can change," I said finally. "He told me that transformation is possible."

"Did he?" Caspar looked out at the darkening sky. "He told me that too, once. When I was young and he still believed I might become something. Before he gave up."

"Perhaps he never gave up."

"Perhaps." Caspar drained the bottle and let it fall from the wall, shattering on the stones below. "Or perhaps he simply ran out of time. That is the thing about transformation, Maratha. It requires time, and time is the one thing none of us have enough of."

He walked away, unsteady on his feet, disappearing into the shadows of the fort his father had built.

I stayed on the wall for a long time, watching the stars emerge above Udayagiri, thinking about fathers and sons and the legacies we inherit whether we want them or not.

---

*We returned to the compound the next day. Life resumed its rhythms - training, patrols, the endless work of maintaining a household guard. But something had shifted in me, some small piece of understanding that had not been there before.*

*De Lannoy was dead. The man who had given me hope was gone. But his words remained, carved into my memory as surely as BRAHMIN-KILLER was carved into my forehead.*

*Travancore takes what it needs. Hearts can change. Transformation is possible.*

*I had met his sons - Hendrik, the success, carrying his father's legacy with pride and discipline; Caspar, the failure, drowning in a bitterness he could not escape. Two paths forward. Two possible futures.*

*I did not know which path I would walk. But I knew, now, that the choice was mine to make. De Lannoy had shown me that. Even in death, he was still teaching.*

*The funeral was over. The legend was buried. But the work remained.*

*It was time to earn my place among the living.*
