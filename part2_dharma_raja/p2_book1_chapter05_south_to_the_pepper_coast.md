# Chapter 5: South to the Pepper Coast

The Ghats rose before me like a wall between worlds.

I had been walking for weeks since Arcot, moving through lands that grew stranger with each passing day. The flat plains of the Carnatic gave way to rolling hills, and the hills gave way to mountains - not the brown, barren ridges of the Deccan, but something else entirely. These mountains were green, impossibly green, shrouded in mist and crowned with forests that seemed to have no end.

The Western Ghats, the traders called them. The barrier between the eastern lands and the pepper coast. Men had been crossing these mountains for centuries, carrying spices one way and silver the other, but the paths were treacherous and the jungle was unforgiving. Every year, traders died in these passes - lost in the mist, taken by tigers, killed by the sudden fevers that rose from the forest floor.

I crossed anyway. I had no choice.

The climb took five days.

I joined a group of pepper traders making the journey west, men who knew the paths and the dangers. They looked at my wrapped head and asked no questions - by now, I had learned that traders rarely asked questions of those who might be useful. I helped carry loads when the porters tired. I stood watch at night when the fires burned low. I made myself invisible in the way that servants and laborers are invisible, present but unnoticed.

The forest pressed close on all sides. I had never seen trees so vast, so ancient, their trunks wider than houses, their canopies blocking out the sky. Birds called in languages I did not know. Monkeys watched from the branches, their eyes too knowing for comfort. Once, we found the tracks of a tiger in the mud beside a stream, each paw print larger than my spread hand.

"He is watching us," one of the traders said, his voice hushed. "They always watch. But they do not always attack. We are too many, and we carry fire."

I thought of the tiger all that night, somewhere in the darkness beyond our campfire, watching with golden eyes. A killer, like me. But the tiger killed to survive. I had killed for silver coins to feed a hunger that was not hunger at all.

The tiger was innocent. I was not.

On the fifth day, we crested the final ridge, and I saw the pepper coast for the first time.

I stopped walking. I could not help it. The traders moved past me, their loads swaying, their feet sure on the descending path. But I stood frozen, staring at a world I had never imagined.

Green. Everything was green - a thousand shades of it, from the dark emerald of the forests to the bright jade of the rice paddies to the pale celadon of the coconut groves. Rivers wound through the landscape like silver ribbons, and beyond them, glittering in the distance, the sea. I had never seen the sea before. It stretched to the horizon and beyond, a vast blue emptiness that made me feel very small.

And the water. Not just the sea, but water everywhere - canals and lagoons and backwaters, a network of liquid roads that seemed to connect every village to every other. Boats moved along these waterways, some small enough for a single fisherman, others large enough to carry merchants and their goods. The land itself seemed to float, half-drowned, more water than earth.

"Beautiful, is it not?" One of the traders had stopped beside me. He was an older man, his face weathered by decades of crossing these mountains. "The first time I saw it, I wept. I am not ashamed to say it."

"I have never seen anything like this," I said.

"No. There is nowhere else like this." He pointed toward a smudge of buildings in the distance, barely visible through the haze. "That is Cranganore. From there, you can take a boat south to Cochin, or further to Quilon. The whole coast is connected by water. A man can travel from one end of Kerala to the other without ever setting foot on land."

"Kerala," I repeated. The name was new to me.

"That is what the people here call their land. The land of coconuts, the land of pepper, the land of a thousand temples." He smiled. "Also the land of a thousand kings, though fewer now than there used to be. Travancore has swallowed many of them."

Travancore. The name pulled at me like a rope. "How far is Travancore from here?"

"A week, perhaps, if you travel by boat. Longer by land." He studied me for a moment. "You are going there? To Travancore?"

"Yes."

"Then be careful. The Travancoreans are proud people. They do not take kindly to strangers, especially strangers from the north. Show respect, keep your head down, and do not give them reason to distrust you."

I almost laughed. Do not give them reason to distrust you. I carried my reasons branded on my forehead for all to see.

But I only nodded and thanked him for his advice, and then I began the long descent toward the green world below.

---

The coast was everything the traders had promised and more.

I travelled by boat when I could afford it, by foot when I could not. The backwaters were a maze, but the boatmen knew their way, and for a few coins they would carry a passenger along with their cargo of coconuts and fish. I learned to eat rice instead of bread, to drink from coconut shells, to sleep in the curved hulls of boats that rocked gently through the night.

The people here were different from any I had known. They spoke Malayalam, a language that flowed like water, all soft consonants and lilting vowels. Their clothes were different - white cotton wraps for the men, bright saris for the women. Their temples were different too, smaller than the towering gopurams of the Carnatic, but somehow more intimate, nestled among the palms like secrets waiting to be discovered.

And everywhere, the smell of pepper.

It grew on vines that climbed the trees, small dark berries that held a fortune in their bitter heat. The Portuguese had come for pepper. The Dutch had come for pepper. The English were coming for pepper. Wars had been fought, kingdoms had risen and fallen, all for the spice that grew so casually along these backwaters.

I thought of Pandit Raghunath Bhat's temple, the silver coins I had stolen. A handful of pepper from these vines was worth more than all that silver. I had killed a man for nothing.

The thought did not bring comfort. Nothing brought comfort. But it was another small lesson in the vastness of the world and the smallness of my crimes within it.

I found Ananthan Pillai's estate on a grey afternoon, the sky heavy with clouds that promised rain.

It had taken me two days to locate it. The name was known - "the Maratha general," people called him, or "the old cavalry commander," or simply "Pillai" - but he lived far from the main waterways, in a compound set among rice paddies and coconut groves. A quiet place for a man who had once been a warrior.

The compound was larger than I had expected. A main house of plastered stone, whitewashed and clean. Several smaller buildings - servants' quarters, perhaps, or storage. A stable that looked well-maintained. A garden where someone had planted flowers that I did not recognise.

I stood at the gate for a long time, gathering my courage.

This was the moment I had been walking toward for months. This was the hope my father had died to give me. Behind this gate was the man who might save me - or who might turn me away to face the hunters who would never stop coming.

I unwrapped the cloth from my head. If Ananthan Pillai was going to judge me, let him see me as I truly was. Let him read the brand on my forehead and make his decision with full knowledge of what stood before him.

I walked through the gate.

---

A servant met me in the courtyard, a young man with suspicious eyes.

"What do you want?"

"I am here to see Ananthan Pillai. I have a letter for him."

The servant's eyes moved to my forehead. I saw his expression shift as he took in the raised scar tissue, the unmistakable shape of letters burned into flesh. "Wait here," he said, and disappeared into the house.

I waited. The clouds grew heavier. Somewhere in the distance, I heard the first rumble of thunder.

The servant returned with an older man behind him. This man was dressed simply, a white dhoti and nothing else, but he moved with the careful economy of a soldier even in old age. His hair was grey, his face lined with decades of sun and wind. A scar ran along his left forearm - an old wound, long healed.

This was Ananthan Pillai. This was the man my father had called Nagoji Sawant.

He looked at me. His eyes moved from my face to the brand on my forehead to my travel-worn clothes to the pack I carried. He took his time, this old soldier, examining me the way a man might examine a horse he was considering buying - looking for flaws, for weaknesses, for the truth beneath the surface.

"The letter," he said. His voice was quiet, almost gentle. That surprised me.

I handed him my father's letter. He unfolded it carefully and read it, his face betraying nothing. When he was done, he read it again.

"Dhanaji's son," he said finally. "I remember your father. He was a good man."

"Yes."

"And you are what? A murderer? A temple robber? A man who let his father die for him?"

I had expected many things from this moment, but not this - not the quiet precision of his contempt, the way he laid out my crimes like items in an inventory. I opened my mouth to explain, to defend myself, but no words came. What defence was there?

"The brand says *brahman-hatyara*," Ananthan continued. "Brahmin-killer. I can read Marathi, even if these southern fools cannot. You killed a priest. That is what brought you here. That is what my old friend's son has become."

"I also have this," I said. I reached into my pack and withdrew the jeweled knife, still wrapped in its cloth. I unwrapped it and held it out to him.

Ananthan Pillai went very still.

He reached out and took the knife from my hands. His fingers traced the jewels on the hilt, the pattern of the blade. I saw something move in his eyes - memory, perhaps, or pain.

"This was mine," he said softly. "I gave it to your father many years ago, when we were both young and foolish and thought we would live forever." He looked up at me. "You stole it. After he died saving your worthless life, you stole the knife I gave him."

"I had nothing else," I said. "He told me to show it to you. He told me to ask you to remember old debts."

"Old debts." Ananthan's voice was bitter now. "Your father saved my life once, in a battle that no one remembers. I never forgot that. I never stopped being grateful for it. And this is how his son repays his memory - by robbing temples, killing priests, and running like a coward when the consequences came due."

The first drops of rain began to fall. Heavy, warm, the monsoon announcing its arrival. Neither of us moved.

"Please," I said. The word came out cracked, broken. I had not meant to beg. But there was nothing else left. "I have nowhere else to go. The Deshmukh's hunters are behind me. If you turn me away, I will die."

"Perhaps you should," Ananthan said. "Perhaps that would be the just ending to your story."

I had no answer to that. He was right. We both knew he was right.

Ananthan Pillai looked at me for a long moment, the rain streaking down both our faces. Then he folded my father's letter and pressed it into my hand. The jeweled knife followed, held out hilt-first, as if it burned him. I took both without speaking.

Then he turned and walked back toward the house.

"I do not take in stray dogs who run from their own messes," he said over his shoulder. "Go away. Find somewhere else to die."

The door closed behind him.

*I stood in the rain for a long time after he left. I did not know where to go. I did not know what to do. The hope that had carried me across mountains and through jungles and along endless waterways - that hope was gone now, washed away by the monsoon like footprints in sand.*

*My father had been wrong. Ananthan Pillai would not help me. The old debts meant nothing in the face of what I had become.*

*I thought about walking into the backwaters and letting myself sink. I thought about finding the nearest cliff and stepping off. I thought about all the ways a man could end his suffering when there was nothing left to live for.*

*But I did not move. I stood in the rain, the brand on my forehead burning as if it had just been made, and I waited.*

*I did not know what I was waiting for. Perhaps I was waiting for the courage to die. Perhaps I was waiting for some sign that I should live.*

*Perhaps I was just too tired to do anything else.*

*The rain fell. The thunder rolled. And I waited.*
