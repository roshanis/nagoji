# Chapter 7: The Lowest Rung

The stable master's name was Velayudhan, and he hated me on sight.

"Another northerner," he said when Revathi's servant brought me to him. "Another Maratha who thinks he knows horses better than men who have worked with them all their lives." He spat into the straw at his feet. "What did you do? Kill someone? Rob a temple?"

"Both," I said.

He stared at me for a moment, then laughed - a harsh, unpleasant sound. "At least you are honest. Most of the wretches who wash up here have a hundred excuses. It was not my fault. I was innocent. Someone else did it." He pointed to a pile of manure in the corner of the stable. "Start shoveling. The dung cart comes at noon. If it is not full by then, you do not eat today."

I picked up the shovel and started shoveling.

---

The work was endless.

Before dawn: feed the horses. After dawn: muck the stalls. Morning: groom the horses, check their hooves, treat any injuries. Afternoon: exercise the horses in the paddock, repair tack, clean equipment. Evening: feed the horses again, lay fresh straw, check the water. After dark: collapse onto my pallet and sleep the dreamless sleep of exhaustion.

By midday the stable became a wet cave. The air was thick with horse sweat and damp hay and the sharp bite of urine. Flies gathered in black knots around the dung pile and lifted in clouds whenever a horse stamped.

Velayudhan gave me the worst tasks, the hardest horses, the longest hours. When I made mistakes - and I made many, unfamiliar with southern horses and southern ways - he berated me in front of the other stable hands. When I did well, he said nothing. That was the best I could hope for: silence.

The other servants watched me with a mixture of curiosity and contempt. They knew what the brand on my forehead meant - Revathi had not bothered to keep my crimes secret. I was the Brahmin-killer, the temple robber, the northerner who had killed his way south. They kept their distance, as if my sins might be contagious.

I did not blame them. I would have done the same.

---

The first time my temper nearly broke me was in the second week.

One of the stable hands - a young man named Kuttan, the son of a cook - decided to test the Brahmin-killer. He was small and quick, with the cruelty of someone who had spent his life at the bottom of hierarchies and finally had someone beneath him.

"They say you killed a priest," he said one morning, loudly enough for everyone to hear. "An old man. Defenseless. Is that what Marathas do? Kill old men for their temple offerings?"

I said nothing. I kept working.

"And then you killed the Deshmukh's son. A nobleman. A warrior." Kuttan circled me like a dog circling a wounded animal. "How did you manage that? Did you stab him in the back? Did you wait until he was not looking?"

"I stabbed him in the chest," I said quietly. "Three times."

Kuttan's smile faltered, but only for a moment. "And your father. They say your father died saving you. They say he fought a dozen men so that his worthless son could run away." He stepped closer. "What kind of man lets his father die for him? What kind of coward-"

I had the shovel in my hands before I knew I had moved. The edge of it was against Kuttan's throat, pressing into the soft flesh beneath his jaw. His eyes went wide with terror. The stable went silent.

"Say that again," I whispered. "Say anything about my father again."

He could not speak. The shovel was pressing too hard. I saw the pulse in his neck, the sweat on his brow, the realization in his eyes that he had pushed too far.

And I wanted to push harder. I wanted to press the shovel through his throat and watch the blood pour out. The same rage that had consumed me in the temple - the blind, burning fury that cared nothing for consequences - it was rising in me again, and I wanted to let it loose.

Then I thought of my father. Of the brand on my forehead. Of the three ghosts who walked beside me.

I stepped back. I lowered the shovel.

"Clean up this stall," I said, my voice strange and distant in my own ears. "I will be in the paddock."

I walked away. Behind me, I heard Kuttan's ragged breathing, the whispers of the other stable hands. I did not look back.

That night, I lay awake for hours, shaking with the aftershocks of what I had almost done. Kuttan's words had been cruel, but they had been true. I had killed an old man. I had stabbed a nobleman in the chest. My father had died for me. These were facts, and facts did not change because I did not want to hear them.

And with the shaking came the old, treacherous thought: smoke would make this easier. Opium would turn guilt into cotton. For a moment my body remembered the den in Sangamner with a longing so sharp it felt like hunger.

I sat up and breathed until it passed.

If I had killed Kuttan, what would have happened? They would have thrown me out - or worse, turned me over to whatever justice existed in these lands. Revathi's protection would have evaporated. My chance at something better would have died with another man's blood on my hands.

I had to be stronger than this. I had to be better.

But I did not know how.

Kesava Pillai came to the stable on a morning in my third week.

I knew who he was before he introduced himself. The resemblance to Ananthan was unmistakable - the same sharp features, the same economical way of moving, the same assessing eyes that seemed to weigh everything they saw. But where Ananthan was grey and weathered, Kesava was young - perhaps a few years older than me, in the prime of his strength.

He was Ananthan and Revathi's grandson, born to their daughter, raised in this household. He wore the clothes of a soldier and carried himself like one. I had heard the servants whispering about him - a captain in Revathi's household guard, already making a name for himself in the small wars that flared along Travancore's borders.

He looked at me the way a man might look at a stain on his floor.

"You are the Maratha," he said. It was not a question.

"Yes."

"The murderer."

"Yes."

"My grandmother thinks you are worth saving." His voice was flat, almost bored. "My grandfather disagrees. I am here to form my own opinion."

I waited.

"Saddle my horse," Kesava said. "The black one, in the end stall. And be quick about it."

I went to the end stall. The black horse was a magnificent animal - tall, strong, with a temper that matched its beauty. Velayudhan had warned me about it; the beast had thrown three stable hands in the past month alone, and one of them was still recovering from a broken arm.

I understood what Kesava was doing. He was testing me, looking for an excuse to confirm what he already believed - that I was worthless, untrustworthy, not worth his grandmother's gamble. If the horse threw me, or if I failed to saddle it properly, he would have his proof.

I approached the horse slowly, speaking softly in Marathi - the language my father had used with his horses, long ago. The animal's ears flicked toward me. Its eyes, dark and deep, watched my every move.

"Easy," I murmured. "Easy, now. I am not here to hurt you."

The horse stamped once, twice. I kept approaching, kept talking. My father's training, buried under years of addiction and violence, rose up from somewhere deep inside me. I knew this. I knew how to do this.

I laid my hand on the horse's neck. It shivered but did not pull away.

I saddled it without incident. I led it out to where Kesava waited, and I handed him the reins.

He took them without a word. He mounted with the fluid grace of a born rider. And then he looked down at me, his expression unchanged.

"My grandmother sees something in you," he said. "I do not. You are a criminal, a murderer, and a coward who let his father die in his place. Nothing you do in these stables will change that. Nothing you do anywhere will change that."

"I know," I said.

"Do you?" He gathered the reins. "We will see. I will be watching you, Maratha. And when you fail - when your true nature shows itself - I will be there to remind my grandmother what she has invited into our home."

He rode out without looking back.

---

The rivalry had begun.

I did not seek it. I did not want it. But Kesava Pillai had decided that I was a threat to his household, an insult to his grandparents, a stain on everything he valued. And he would not rest until he had proven himself right.

In the weeks that followed, he found excuses to come to the stable. He demanded tasks that were beyond my station - grooming his horse personally, polishing his saddle, standing ready whenever he might need something. When I performed these tasks adequately, he found fault. When I made mistakes, he reported them to Revathi.

But Revathi said nothing. She watched, and she waited, and she let Kesava test me as he wished.

I think she wanted to see how I would respond. Whether I would fight back, or break, or find some way to endure.

I chose endurance.

Every insult Kesava offered, I swallowed. Every task he demanded, I performed. When he called me a murderer, I agreed. When he called me a coward, I did not argue. I gave him nothing to grip, no excuse to escalate, no reason to demand my expulsion.

It was not courage. It was not even patience. It was simply the recognition that I had no other choice. If I wanted to survive - if I wanted to become something other than the sum of my crimes - I had to accept whatever was given to me, bear whatever burdens were placed on my back.

The brand on my forehead burned with shame every time Kesava spoke to me. The three ghosts whispered that I deserved everything he said and more.

But I kept working. I kept shoveling. I kept putting one foot in front of the other.

It was all I knew how to do.

---

*Months passed. The monsoon ended and the dry season began. I learned the rhythms of the stable, the names of the horses, the ways of the southern land. My hands grew calloused from the shovel and the brush. My body hardened from the endless labor.*

*Kuttan kept his distance after the incident with the shovel, but his eyes followed me everywhere, waiting for another chance to strike. Kesava continued his campaign of contempt, visiting the stable at least twice a week, always finding something to criticize.*

*And Ananthan - the man my father had called Nagoji Sawant - I saw him only from a distance. He kept his word: he wanted nothing to do with me. When our paths crossed, he looked through me as if I were not there.*

*Only Revathi acknowledged my existence. Once a week, she summoned me to report on my progress. She listened without comment, asked a few sharp questions, and dismissed me. I never knew what she was thinking, whether I was meeting her expectations or falling short.*

*I was still the lowest rung. I was still a servant among servants, a criminal tolerated rather than accepted. But I was still alive, still working, still waiting for something I could not name.*

*Perhaps this was redemption: not a moment of forgiveness, but an endless series of days in which I chose to be better than I had been. Perhaps this was all I would ever have.*

*It would have to be enough.*
