# Chapter 6: Revathi's Gambit

I do not know how long I stood in the rain.

Long enough for the monsoon to soak through my clothes, through my skin, down to the bones. Long enough for the grey afternoon to darken toward evening. Long enough for the servants to peer at me through the windows and whisper among themselves about the madman at the gate.

I was not waiting for anything. I was simply too empty to move.

The door opened again.

A woman stepped out onto the covered veranda, shielded from the rain by the overhang of the roof. She was old - older than Ananthan, perhaps, her hair grey and her face lined with decades of living. But she stood straight, moved with purpose, and her eyes when they found me were sharp and clear.

"So," she said. "You are Dhanaji's son."

I nodded. Speech seemed beyond me.

"My husband tells me you are a murderer. A temple robber. A man who wears his shame branded on his face for all to see." She studied me with an expression I could not read. "He says you are not worth saving."

"He is probably right."

"Probably." She was silent for a moment, watching the rain fall between us. "Your father saved my husband's life once. Did you know that?"

"He mentioned it in his letter."

"It was a small thing, in the grand scheme of battles and wars. A sword stroke that would have taken Nagoji's head. Your father turned it aside. Neither of them thought much of it at the time - such things happen in war, and soldiers do not keep accounts of every moment." She paused. "But I remembered. I always remember."

The rain ran off the roof in steady sheets. I swallowed hard, because hearing my father's name spoken with something like respect made my throat tighten in a way that felt dangerous.

"Come inside," she said. "Before you drown out there."

Her name was Revathi, and she was nothing like I expected.

The house was simple but comfortable, furnished in the southern style with low seats and woven mats. Servants brought dry clothes, hot food, a cup of something warm and spiced that burned going down. I sat in a corner, dripping on the floor, too stunned to do more than accept what was offered.

Revathi sat across from me, watching me eat. Ananthan was nowhere to be seen.

"My husband has gone to his study," she said, as if reading my thoughts. "He does not approve of what I am doing. We argued about it. We argue about many things, these days." A faint smile crossed her face. "We have been arguing for thirty years. It is how we know we are still alive."

"Why did you bring me in?" I asked. "He made his position clear. I am not worth saving."

"Perhaps not." Revathi's eyes moved to the brand on my forehead. I had not rewrapped it; there seemed no point anymore. "But I have learned, over many years, that worth is not always apparent at first glance. I have seen men who appeared worthless become invaluable. And I have seen men who appeared great become nothing."

"I killed a priest. I killed a nobleman's son. My father died because of me."

"Yes. All of that is true." She did not flinch from it. "And yet you are still alive. You walked across half of India with hunters behind you and a brand on your face, and you are still alive. That suggests something, does it not?"

"Cowardice. The inability to accept the death I deserve."

Revathi laughed - a short, sharp sound that startled me. "Cowardice? Boy, I have seen cowards. They run a few miles and then surrender to despair. They drink themselves to death in the first tavern they find. They do not cross the Ghats with nothing but a stolen knife and a letter from a dead man." She leaned forward. "No. You are many things, but you are not a coward. You are a survivor. And survivors have their uses."

---

The argument came that night.

I was in the small room they had given me - a servant's quarters, barely larger than a closet, but dry and warm. I lay on the pallet they had provided, staring at the ceiling, listening to the rain drum on the roof.

Through the thin walls, I heard their voices.

"You cannot keep him here." That was Ananthan, his quiet voice raised in frustration. "He is a murderer. A criminal. The Deshmukh's hunters will come for him eventually, and when they do, they will bring trouble to our door."

"Let them come." Revathi's voice was calm, almost amused. "We are in Travancore, not the Deccan. The Deshmukh has no authority here."

"Authority can be purchased. You heard what the boy said - a hundred gold mohurs for his head. That is enough to tempt even men who should know better."

"Then we will deal with that when it comes. For now, he stays."

"Why?" Real anguish in Ananthan's voice now. "Why do you insist on this? Dhanaji is dead. The debt died with him. We owe this boy nothing."

A pause. When Revathi spoke again, her voice was softer, but no less firm. "I owe Dhanaji my husband's life. That debt does not die so easily. And beyond that..." Another pause. "I see something in the boy, Nagoji. Something that reminds me of you."

"That is ridiculous. I was never-"

"You were exactly like him. When you first came here, you were a broken thing. A prisoner, a castaway, a man with nothing left to lose. You had blood on your hands too, even if it was not branded on your face. And look what you became."

"That was different."

"Was it? You killed men in battle. He killed men in a temple. Is the blood any less red?"

"He killed a priest! An innocent man! And for what? For opium money!"

"And you killed men who were fighting for their homes, their families, their kingdom. Men who believed they were in the right. Men who died never knowing why." Revathi's voice was gentle now, but there was steel beneath the gentleness. "We all have blood on our hands, husband. The only question is what we do with the life that blood has purchased."

Silence. I held my breath, waiting.

"You will not relent, will you?" Ananthan said finally.

"No."

"And if I forbid it?"

"Then I will remind you that this house belongs to me, that my household is mine to manage, and that you have never once in thirty years successfully forbidden me anything."

Despite everything - despite the horror of my situation, the shame of my position, the uncertainty of my future - I almost smiled. There was something in the way they argued, these two old soldiers, that spoke of a love too deep for easy words. They fought because they trusted each other enough to fight. They disagreed because they knew their disagreements would not destroy them.

I had never had anything like that. I wondered if I ever would.

"Very well," Ananthan said. "Keep him. But I want nothing to do with it. He is your project, your responsibility. If he causes trouble, it is on your head."

"Agreed."

Footsteps. A door opening and closing. Then silence.

I lay in the darkness, listening to the rain, and I tried to understand what had just happened.

Revathi had saved me. Against her husband's wishes, against all reason, she had offered me shelter when I had no right to expect it. But she had done it for her own reasons - because she saw something in me, or because she wanted something from me, or simply because she refused to let her husband have the final word.

Whatever the reason, I was alive. I had a roof over my head. I had a chance.

It was more than I deserved. It was more than I had any right to hope for.

---

The next morning, Revathi summoned me to the main house.

She was seated in a high-backed chair, dressed in the white sari of a widow or a holy woman, though I learned later she was neither. Her eyes tracked me as I entered, and I felt the weight of her assessment - the same feeling I had felt when Ananthan examined me, but sharper somehow, more searching.

"Sit," she said, pointing to a low stool across from her. "We have things to discuss."

I sat.

"You will stay in my household," she began. "Not as a guest - you have not earned that privilege - but as a servant. The lowest rank. You will work in the stables, you will eat with the other servants, you will sleep in the room you were given last night. You will not speak to my husband unless he speaks to you first. You will not leave the compound without permission. You will not cause trouble of any kind. Is that understood?"

"Yes."

"Good." She leaned forward slightly. "Now. Tell me everything. Not the version you told my husband, not the version you have been telling yourself. The truth. All of it."

I told her.

I told her about the opium, about the slow descent from Dhanaji's son to a creature who cared for nothing but the next smoke. I told her about the temple, Pandit Raghunath Bhat's quiet voice saying *Dhanaji's son*, the moment when shame turned to violence. I told her about Vikram, who had only tried to do what was right. I told her about the brand, the execution ground, my father's last fight.

I told her about the running, the hiding, the months of fear. I told her about Ismail Khan and Shankar and Muthu and all the strangers who had helped me for reasons I still did not understand. I told her about the hunters in Arcot, the Company havildar named Raman who had let me go, the long journey through the green lands to this place.

When I was done, the sun had moved across the sky, and my throat was raw from speaking.

Revathi was silent for a long moment. Then she nodded, once, as if I had confirmed something she already suspected.

"You are not a good man," she said. "You may never be a good man. The things you have done - they cannot be undone, cannot be forgiven, cannot be washed away by any amount of penance or prayer."

"I know."

"But." She held up one finger. "You are still alive. You survived when easier men would have died. That is something. Not virtue, perhaps, but something." She rose from her chair. "We will see what can be made of you. In the meantime, the stable master will put you to work. Try not to disappoint me."

I stood as well, uncertain whether I should bow or speak or simply leave.

"There is one more thing," Revathi said. "My husband gave you a name. Ananthan Pillai. But when you came here, you asked for Nagoji Sawant."

"That was the name in my father's letter."

"Yes. The name he had before Travancore made him something else." She studied me with those sharp, measuring eyes. "You will need a new name too, eventually. The man you were died in that temple. Whoever you become - if you become anyone at all - he will need a different name."

"What name?"

"I do not know yet. We will see what you earn." She turned toward the door. "Go. The stable master is waiting."

I went. Behind me, I heard her call for a servant, already moving on to the next task. I was a project now, a problem to be managed. It was not respect. It was not affection.

But it was a chance. And I had learned, in my long journey south, that chances were more than most men ever received.

---

*That night, I lay in my servant's quarters and thought about Revathi's words. You are not a good man. You may never be a good man. She had not tried to comfort me with false hope or easy promises. She had looked at me clearly, seen what I was, and decided to help me anyway.*

*I did not understand her reasons. Perhaps she truly saw something in me, some potential I could not see in myself. Perhaps she simply wanted to prove a point to her husband, to win an argument that had been running for decades. Perhaps she collected broken things the way some people collected coins or curiosities.*

*It did not matter. What mattered was that I was alive, I had shelter, and I had work to do. The brand on my forehead still burned. The three ghosts still walked beside me. But for the first time since Sangamner, I had a reason to wake up in the morning.*

*It was not much. But it was a beginning.*

*Revathi had called me a survivor. Very well. I would survive. And perhaps, if I was very lucky and very careful, I would become something more than the sum of my crimes.*

*Perhaps.*
