# Chapter 12: Ananthan's Last Lessons

He came to the training yard on a morning in the monsoon season.

I was practicing sword forms, alone in the grey light before dawn, when I heard footsteps behind me. I turned, expecting Kesava or one of the other guards, and found myself face to face with Ananthan Pillai.

He looked older than when I had first seen him - older even than at De Lannoy's funeral, which we had both attended without speaking. The years were catching up with him, stealing the strength that had once made him legendary. But his eyes were still sharp, still measuring, still seeing more than he revealed.

"Your form is sloppy," he said. "Your father would be ashamed."

I lowered the sword. In all the months I had lived in his household, this was the first time he had spoken to me directly. The first time he had acknowledged my existence beyond a cold glance across a crowded room.

"I am still learning," I said.

"You should have learned years ago. Before you wasted your life on opium and temple robbery." He walked to the weapons rack and selected a practice blade - wooden, weighted to match steel. "Come. Let me see what Kesava has been teaching you."

---

He beat me easily.

It was not even close. Despite his age, despite the stiffness in his joints and the grey in his hair, Ananthan moved with a precision I could not match. Every strike I attempted, he deflected. Every opening I thought I saw, he closed before I could exploit it. Within minutes, I was disarmed, flat on my back in the mud, his practice blade at my throat.

"Pathetic," he said. "You have strength. You have speed. But you fight like a street brawler, not a cavalry rider. Your father would weep to see this."

"Then teach me," I said.

He considered me for a long moment. The rain was falling harder now, plastering his grey hair to his skull, running down the blade he held at my neck. I could not read his expression.

"Get up," he said finally. "We will start again."

---

He came back the next day. And the day after that.

Every morning, before dawn, I would find him waiting in the training yard. Every morning, he would beat me - sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly, but always thoroughly. And after each defeat, he would point out what I had done wrong, how I had left myself open, where my technique had failed.

He was not a gentle teacher. He did not praise progress or offer encouragement. He simply demanded excellence, and when I failed to deliver it, he made me pay in bruises and humiliation.

But he was teaching me. After all those months of silence, after his initial rejection, Ananthan Pillai was teaching me to fight.

I did not understand why. I was afraid to ask.

---

The conversations began in the third week.

We had finished our morning session, and I was sitting on a bench, nursing a welt on my ribs where his blade had found its mark. Ananthan sat beside me - the first time he had lingered after training rather than simply walking away.

"De Lannoy is dead," he said.

"I know. I was at the funeral."

"I saw you there. Standing in the back with the guards." He was silent for a moment. "He wrote to me, before he died. He told me about your conversation in the chapel."

I waited.

"He said you reminded him of himself. A broken man who might yet become something." Ananthan's voice was flat, without emotion. "I told him he was a fool. That you were nothing like him - that he had been a soldier captured in war, while you were a criminal who had murdered his way south."

"You were right."

"Was I?" He turned to look at me. "De Lannoy came here in chains. He had fought against Travancore, killed our soldiers, tried to destroy everything we were building. And yet Marthanda Varma saw something in him. Gave him a chance. Made him into the legend he became."

"That was different."

"Different how? He was the enemy. You are a murderer. Both of you came here with blood on your hands. Both of you were given chances you did not deserve." Ananthan shook his head slowly. "I have been thinking about this since the funeral. Thinking about why I refused to help you, why I wanted nothing to do with my old friend's son."

"Because I am not worth helping."

"No. Because you remind me of myself."

---

He told me, then, about Colachel.

Not the legend - I had heard the legend a dozen times, the story of how Travancore had broken the Dutch. He told me about the reality. About the chaos of battle, the screams of dying men, the blood that had soaked into the sand until the beach ran red.

"I was young then," he said. "Younger than you are now. And I was angry - angry at the world, angry at my fate, angry at everything that had brought me to that place. I killed men that day not because I had to, but because I wanted to. Because the killing made me feel alive in a way nothing else did."

"That is not the same as what I did."

"Is it not? You killed the priest in a moment of panic - I understand that. But the Deshmukh's son? You stabbed him three times. Not once, not twice. Three times." Ananthan's eyes held mine. "That was not self-defense. That was rage. That was the same thing I felt on the beach at Colachel, the same hunger for blood that had nothing to do with survival and everything to do with what was broken inside me."

I could not argue with him. He was right.

"Your father saved my life that day," Ananthan continued. "Did you know that? A Dutch soldier came at me from behind while I was... occupied with another kill. Dhanaji turned the blade aside. If he had been a moment slower, I would have died."

"He mentioned it in his letter."

"I owed him a debt for that. A debt I never repaid." Ananthan's voice grew heavy. "When you came here, carrying his letter, I should have honored that debt. Instead, I turned you away because I saw in you what I had tried so hard to bury in myself. The rage. The hunger. The broken thing that kills because it does not know how else to feel alive."

"Revathi took me in."

"Revathi is wiser than I am. She always has been." A ghost of a smile crossed his face. "She saw what De Lannoy saw - potential. I saw only a mirror I did not want to look into."

---

The training sessions continued, but now they were something more.

Between the drills and the sparring, Ananthan talked. He told me about the old days - about Marthanda Varma and his vision for Travancore, about Ramayyan the Dalawa and his cunning, about De Lannoy's transformation from enemy to architect. He told me about his own transformation, from Nagoji Sawant the Maratha prisoner to Ananthan Pillai the cavalry commander.

"I changed my name when I converted," he said one morning. "Not because anyone forced me - Marthanda Varma would have let me keep my old name if I wanted. But I needed to become someone new. The man I had been was a killer, a savage, a creature of rage. The man I wanted to be needed a different name."

"And did the new name change you?"

"No. Nothing changes that easily. The rage is still there, even now. I simply learned to control it. To use it instead of being used by it." He handed me a practice blade. "That is what I am trying to teach you. Not just sword forms, but control. The difference between a warrior and a murderer is not strength or skill - it is the ability to choose when to kill and when to hold back."

"I am not sure I have that ability."

"Neither was I, at your age. But I learned. And so will you, if you are willing to do the work."

---

Near the end of our time together, he said something I have never forgotten.

We had finished a particularly brutal session - he had broken through my guard repeatedly, leaving welts on my arms and chest and legs. I was exhausted, frustrated, ready to give up.

"Your father was the better man," Ananthan said quietly. "He had the same strength as me, the same skills, but without the rage. He killed when he had to, not because he wanted to. He saved my life not because he owed me anything, but because it was the right thing to do."

"Then why are you teaching me?" I asked. "If he was the better man, why not just tell me to be like him?"

"Because you are not like him. You are like me." Ananthan's eyes were sad, weary, old. "The rage is in you, just as it was in me. You cannot wish it away or pretend it does not exist. The only thing you can do is learn to master it - to make it serve you instead of destroying you."

"And if I cannot?"

"Then you will end up dead, or worse - you will end up killing someone else who does not deserve it. Another priest. Another nobleman's son. Another innocent." He placed a hand on my shoulder - the first time he had touched me with anything other than a training blade. "Try to be more like your father than like me. But if you cannot be like him, then at least learn from my mistakes. That is all any of us can do."

*The training sessions lasted three months. Every morning, before dawn, in rain and sun and the thick humidity of the Kerala summer. By the end, I could hold my own against Ananthan for several minutes before he beat me. It was not victory, but it was progress.*

*More importantly, I understood now what he was trying to give me. Not just skill with a blade, but a way of thinking about violence. A framework for the rage that still burned inside me, waiting for its chance to break free.*

*Ananthan Pillai had been a killer. He had learned to become something else - not through forgetting what he was, but through mastering it. He was offering me the same path.*

*I did not know if I could walk it. But for the first time, I believed it might be possible.*

*"Your father was the better man. Try to be more like him than like me."*

*Those words stayed with me long after Ananthan stopped coming to the training yard. They stay with me still.*

*I am not sure I will ever live up to them. But I have not stopped trying.*
