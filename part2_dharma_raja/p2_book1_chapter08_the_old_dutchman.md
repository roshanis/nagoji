# Chapter 8: The Old Dutchman

Udayagiri Fort rose from the coastal plain like a fist of stone.

I had heard stories of it in the months since my arrival - the great fortress that guarded Travancore's southern approaches, the masterwork of a foreign general who had become more Travancorean than the Travancoreans themselves. But stories had not prepared me for the reality. The walls stretched higher than any I had seen, bristling with cannon emplacements. The gates were reinforced with iron. Soldiers drilled in the courtyard with a precision that would have impressed any army in India.

Velayudhan had sent me here with a message for the garrison's horse master - something about a breeding stallion, a matter too trivial for anyone of importance. It was the kind of errand that fell to the lowest servants, the ones whose absence would not be noticed.

I did not mind. It was a chance to see something beyond the stable, to breathe air that did not smell of manure, to remember that there was a world outside my small corner of shame.

The horse master received the message, grunted something about sending a reply in the morning, and dismissed me. I had several hours before I needed to start back. On impulse, I decided to explore.

---

The fort was a maze of walls and courtyards, barracks and storehouses, designed by a mind that understood war in ways I could not fathom. Every angle was calculated for defence. Every position offered a clear line of fire. I had seen forts in the Deccan - crumbling relics of Mughal ambition - but nothing like this. This was a weapon made of stone.

I wandered through the outer courtyards, keeping my head down, trying to look like I belonged. The soldiers ignored me; I was clearly a servant, clearly beneath their notice. That suited me well enough.

I found the chapel by accident.

It was a small building tucked into a corner of the inner courtyard, its architecture strange and foreign - pointed arches, a cross above the door, windows of coloured glass that cast patterns of light on the stone floor. A Christian chapel, I realised. The religion of the Portuguese, the Dutch, the English. The religion of the foreigners who had been coming to these shores for centuries.

The door was open. I stepped inside.

---

An old man knelt before the altar.

He looked older than my father ever had the chance to look, though he could not have been much past his early sixties. His white hair fell past his shoulders, and his frame, once powerful, had been bent and pared down by years of heat and war. He wore a simple white dhoti, like any Travancorean, but something in his bearing spoke of other places, other lives.

He did not turn when I entered. He remained kneeling, his head bowed, his lips moving in silent prayer.

I should have left. I had no business here, no right to intrude on a stranger's devotions. But something held me in place - curiosity, perhaps, or the strange peace of the chapel, or simply the exhaustion of a man who had been running for so long.

I waited.

After a long moment, the old man crossed himself and rose. He turned, and I saw his face for the first time.

It was a European face - pale skin weathered by decades of Indian sun, blue eyes faded to grey, features that spoke of a world I had never seen. But there was something else in that face, something I recognised: the look of a man who had travelled far from home and found, against all odds, a place where he belonged.

"You are the Maratha," he said. His voice was thin but clear, his Malayalam accented with something foreign. "The one they are keeping in Revathi's stables."

I should not have been surprised that he knew. Everyone seemed to know. "Yes."

"The one with the brand." He gestured toward my forehead. I had stopped wrapping it in the compound, accepting that concealment was impossible. "I cannot read Marathi, but I have been told what it says."

"Brahmin-killer."

"Yes." He studied me with those faded blue eyes. "That is a heavy thing to carry. The weight of it must be very great."

"It is."

He nodded slowly, as if I had confirmed something he suspected. "I am Eustachius De Lannoy. Perhaps you have heard my name."

I had heard it. Everyone in Travancore had heard it. The Dutch commander who had been captured at Colachel, who had converted to the faith of his captors, who had built Travancore's army into a force that could challenge European powers. He was a legend - and he was standing before me, frail and ancient, in a chapel that smelled of incense and age.

"I have heard of you," I said.

"Good things or bad?"

"Both. They say you were the enemy once. They say you became something else."

De Lannoy smiled - a faint, tired expression that did not quite reach his eyes. "Both are true. I came to these shores to conquer. I was conquered instead. God has a sense of humour, I think." He gestured to a bench along the wall. "Sit with me for a moment. My legs are not what they were."

We sat together in the coloured light from the windows. The chapel was silent except for the distant sounds of the fort - soldiers drilling, horses stamping, the everyday noises of a garrison.

"Tell me," De Lannoy said, "why did you come here? To Travancore, I mean. Not to this chapel."

"I had nowhere else to go. My father told me to seek a man named Ananthan Pillai. He said there was a debt between them."

"Ah. Nagoji." De Lannoy's eyes grew distant. "I know him well. We fought together in the old days, when the kingdom was young and everything was uncertain. He was a prisoner once, like me. Wreckage from a different storm." He paused. "And now you are wreckage too."

"Yes."

"And Nagoji - Ananthan - he has refused to help you."

"He wants nothing to do with me. His wife took me in against his wishes."

"Revathi." A softness entered De Lannoy's voice. "She is a remarkable woman. She sees things that others miss. If she has decided to help you, there is a reason for it, even if you do not yet understand what it is."

I stared at the stone floor between my feet, where the coloured light lay like spilled paint. The word *Revathi* sounded in his mouth like a name carried for years, not a title spoken out of duty.

"May I ask you something?" I said.

"Ask."

"How did you do it? How did you go from being the enemy to being... this?" I gestured at the fort around us, the walls he had built, the army he had trained. "How did you become one of them?"

De Lannoy was silent for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was very quiet.

"I did not become one of them. I became something new. Not Dutch. Not Travancorean. Something that had not existed before." He turned to look at me directly. "You cannot go back to what you were. The man you were died in that temple, with blood on his hands and his father's life as the price of his escape. That man is gone. The question is: what will you become instead?"

"I do not know."

"No. You would not, not yet." He smiled again, that faint tired expression. "Travancore is a strange place. It takes what it needs from those who come here. It took my knowledge of war and made it into walls and cannons and disciplined soldiers. It took Nagoji's strength and made it into something the kingdom could use. Perhaps it will take something from you as well."

"I have nothing to offer. I am a stable hand. A criminal. The lowest of servants."

"So was Nagoji, once. So was I." De Lannoy rose slowly, his joints creaking with the effort. "I was the enemy. Now my bones will rest in this soil. Travancore takes what it needs, and it gives back what it chooses. You cannot control it. You can only endure, and wait, and try to become worthy of whatever chance you are given."

He walked toward the altar, then stopped and looked back at me.

"The brand on your forehead - it marks you as a killer of priests. A defiler of temples. The worst kind of sinner." His eyes held mine. "I have seen men pray all their lives and die screaming in mud. I have also seen killers build walls that saved thousands. The scar is not the end of you unless you let it be."

"I am not a Christian."

"No. But you are a man. And all men, whatever gods they worship, have the capacity to become more than their worst moment." He gestured toward the door. "Go back to your stable. Do the work that is given to you. And when the chance comes - when Travancore asks something of you - be ready to answer."

I rose and walked toward the door. At the threshold, I stopped. The words I should have offered gathered in my throat and stuck there, thick as porridge.

"May your God keep you," I managed at last, and hated myself for how small it sounded.

"Do not thank me. I have given you nothing but words. It is what you do with them that matters." He turned back to the altar, his white hair catching the coloured light. "Go in peace, Brahmin-killer. And try to find a way to live with the name they have given you."

---

I walked back through the fort in a daze.

The soldiers were still drilling. The horses were still stamping. The world was exactly as it had been an hour before. But something had shifted inside me - some small piece of the weight I carried had been rearranged, if not lifted.

De Lannoy had been the enemy. He had come to conquer and had been conquered instead. And he had built all of this - the walls, the army, the legacy that would outlast him. He had become something new.

*Travancore takes what it needs.*

I did not know what Travancore could possibly need from me. I had nothing to offer but my shame, my brand, my three ghosts.

But the old Dutchman had planted a seed. The idea that transformation was possible. The idea that wreckage could be rebuilt.

I did not believe it. Not fully. But as I walked back toward the stables, I found myself thinking about it. Wondering if it could be true.

Wondering what I might become, if I was given the chance.

---

*Years later, I learned that De Lannoy died shortly after our meeting. He was buried in the chapel where we had spoken, beneath a tombstone that bore his name and his titles and a few words in a language I could not read.*

*I never saw him again. But I never forgot what he told me.*

*Travancore takes what it needs. Hearts can change. You cannot control what becomes of you - only endure, and wait, and try to be worthy.*

*It was not much wisdom. But it was enough to keep me going through the dark months that followed. Enough to remind me that other men had walked this path before me, and that some of them had found their way to something better.*

*If a Dutch conqueror could become a Travancorean legend, perhaps a Maratha murderer could become... something.*

*I did not know what. But I was beginning to believe it might be possible.*
