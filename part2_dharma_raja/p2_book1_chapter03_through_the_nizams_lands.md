# Chapter 3: Through the Nizam's Lands

I learned to lie on the road south.

Not the clumsy lies of a desperate man - those I had already mastered. I learned the careful, patient lies of a survivor. The lies you tell with your body, your voice, your eyes. The lies that become so familiar they begin to feel like truth.

My name was Govind. I was a horse trader from Pune, travelling south to buy stock from the Carnatic breeders. My face had been burned in a stable fire when I was young - a tragedy, yes, but one that had taught me the value of hard work and humility. I did not drink. I did not gamble. I kept to myself and caused no trouble.

This was the man I invented in the weeks after Aurangabad. This was the mask I wore over the brand that could never be hidden.

It was not a good disguise. Anyone who looked closely at my forehead would see that the scars were letters, not random burns. Anyone who asked the right questions would discover that I knew nothing about horse trading beyond what I had absorbed from my father's stories. But most people do not look closely. Most people hear what they expect to hear and see what they expect to see.

I counted on that. I had nothing else to count on.

The caravan found me on the road three days south of Aurangabad.

I had been walking since dawn, keeping to the lesser tracks that wound through the hills, when I heard the bells. Camel bells, dozens of them, chiming in an uneven rhythm that announced a trading caravan. I stepped off the road and crouched behind a boulder, watching as they passed.

There were perhaps thirty camels, loaded with bundles of cloth and crates of goods I could not identify. A dozen men walked alongside them - guards and drivers and merchants. At the head of the column rode a fat man on a fine horse, his clothes marking him as the caravan master.

I should have let them pass. Joining a group meant exposure, questions, the risk of discovery. But I had been walking for three days on little food and less water, and the road ahead promised only more of the same. The Deccan in summer is no place for a man on foot.

I stepped out from behind the boulder and raised my hand.

---

The caravan master's name was Ismail Khan. He was a Muslim trader from Bidar, making the long journey south to the markets of Arcot and beyond. He looked at my wrapped head, listened to my story of the stable fire, and quoted a price for joining his caravan that was only moderately extortionate.

"You can walk with the guards," he said. "Help with the camels when needed. We do not feed passengers, but we do not abandon them either. Do you have weapons?"

I showed him my knife - the plain one, not my father's blade.

"That will do. There are bandits in these hills. The Marathas and the Nizam have been fighting for years, and when the armies leave, the robbers remain. A man who can use a knife is worth his food."

I nodded and fell in with the guards at the rear of the column.

They were a mixed group - Hindus and Muslims, Deccanis and men from further south. They looked at my wrapped head with curiosity but asked no questions. Perhaps they had seen worse. Perhaps they did not care. In a caravan, every man has his secrets, and the wise do not pry.

I was grateful for their indifference. It was the closest thing to kindness I had known since my father died.

---

We travelled through a land that had been scoured by war.

The Marathas and the Nizam had been fighting over these territories for as long as anyone could remember. Villages had been burned and rebuilt and burned again. Fields lay fallow, their farmers dead or fled. The forts that crowned the hilltops changed hands with the seasons, flying different flags depending on which army had passed through most recently.

"Twenty years ago, this was all Mughal land," one of the guards told me. He was an older man named Shankar, missing three fingers on his left hand - a wound from some forgotten battle. "Then the Marathas came. Then the Nizam. Then the Marathas again. The people here have learned to survive by bending with the wind."

"And now?" I asked.

"Now?" He spat into the dust. "Now there is a new wind blowing from the south. Mysore. They say Hyder Ali is building an army like nothing the Deccan has ever seen. Rockets that can tear a man apart from a hundred yards. Infantry drilled in the European style. Cavalry that fights like demons."

"Will he come north?"

"He has already come north. Twice, three times. Each time he takes a little more. The Nizam makes treaties with him, then breaks them. The Marathas fight him, then retreat. Meanwhile, the villages burn and the people die." He shrugged. "It is the way of things. The great ones fight, and we survive as best we can."

I looked at the burned-out shells of houses that lined the road, the fields gone to weeds, the hollow-eyed children who watched us pass. I had thought my own suffering was vast. I had not considered that the world contained suffering far greater than mine.

It was a small lesson, but I remembered it.

---

The bandits came on the seventh day.

We were passing through a narrow defile between two hills when they appeared - a dozen men on horseback, blocking the road ahead. More emerged from the rocks on either side, on foot, armed with swords and spears. Their leader was a lean man with a scarred face, mounted on a grey horse that had seen better days.

"Caravan tax," he announced, his voice carrying easily in the still air. "The roads through these hills are under our protection. The fee is one-tenth of your goods, plus whatever silver you carry. Pay it, and you may pass. Refuse, and..." He drew his sword and let the blade catch the sunlight. "Well. We are reasonable men. We prefer not to kill. But we will if we must."

Ismail Khan rode forward, his hands spread in a gesture of peace. "My friend, these are hard times for honest traders. One-tenth is more than we can afford. Surely we can come to an arrangement-"

"One-tenth," the bandit leader repeated. "Or we take everything, including your lives."

The negotiation continued for several minutes, the caravan master pleading poverty while the bandit leader grew visibly impatient. I watched from my position near the rear of the column, calculating distances and angles. Twelve mounted men ahead. Perhaps twenty on foot in the rocks. Our guards numbered only ten, and half of them looked ready to run.

Then I saw the other riders.

They were coming up behind us, moving quietly, using the rocks for cover. Four more bandits, circling around to cut off our retreat. In a few minutes, we would be completely surrounded.

I did not think. I acted.

"Behind us!" I shouted, and I ran toward the approaching riders.

---

I remember it in pieces.

The camel bells clanging as the column lurched. Pebbles skittering under hooves. The sound my own breath made, too loud in that narrow cut of road.

The first rider behind us had his sword raised when I reached him. I did not meet the blade. I met the horse. I seized the bridle with one hand and drove my shoulder into its chest, feeling the animal's heat and panic through its hide. It reared, screaming, and the rider pitched sideways.

My knife found him when he hit the ground. Once, hard, in the soft place under the ribs. He made a wet sound, like someone trying to swallow water in a hurry, and then he was only weight.

The second rider tried to wheel around me. I slashed at the horse's hock and felt tendon give. The leg folded, and the animal went down, dragging its man with it. He rolled, scrabbling for his sword, his eyes lifting to my forehead as if the brand could stop me.

It did not. I ended him quickly and moved aside as the horse thrashed.

The other two riders saw what had happened and lost their nerve. They turned their horses and ran for the hills, shouting up the line to their companions.

That was enough. Somewhere ahead, the bandit leader hesitated. Ismail Khan's guards saw the riders fleeing and found their courage. The defile filled with shouting and steel and the scream of frightened camels. Then the bandits were breaking, melting into the rocks and scrub, leaving the road behind them like a skin they had shed.

When it was over, two of the riders were dead and the road was littered with bodies.

I stood among them, breathing hard, the knife still in my hand. Blood dripped from my fingers. My wrapped head had come loose in the fighting, exposing the brand on my forehead.

Shankar was staring at me. His eyes moved from the brand to my face and back again.

"*Brahman-hatyara*," he read aloud. "Brahmin-killer. That is what it says?"

I did not answer. There was no point in lying now.

"I have heard of you," he said slowly. "The Deshmukh's son. The temple. A hundred gold mohurs for your head."

My hand tightened on the knife. If I had to fight my way out of this caravan, I would. I had nothing left to lose.

But Shankar only laughed - a dry, humourless sound. "Put that away, boy. If I wanted the reward, I would have to share it with the others. By the time it was divided, there would be barely enough to buy a decent horse." He spat again. "Besides. You just saved us all from losing far more than a hundred mohurs. Ismail Khan will not forget that."

He turned and walked back toward the caravan, leaving me standing among the dead.

---

That night, Ismail Khan summoned me to his tent.

The caravan had made camp in a sheltered valley, posting double guards after the bandit attack. The wounded had been tended, the dead buried, the goods inventoried to ensure nothing had been lost. Through it all, I had kept to myself, waiting for someone to denounce me.

No one had. But I knew the silence could not last.

"Sit," Ismail Khan said, gesturing to a cushion across from him. He poured two cups of chai and pushed one toward me. "Drink."

I drank. The chai was sweet and strong and hot, and I realised how long it had been since I had tasted anything so good.

"Shankar told me about your forehead," Ismail Khan said. "He told me what the brand says."

"Yes."

"Is it true? Did you kill a Brahmin?"

"Yes." There was no point in denial. "And the Deshmukh's son. And my father died saving me from the execution."

Ismail Khan studied me for a long moment. His eyes were shrewd, calculating - the eyes of a man who had survived decades of trade in a land torn by war.

"You fought well today," he said finally. "You saw the men behind us when no one else did. You acted while others froze. That is worth something."

"I was running. I panicked."

"You ran toward the enemy. That is not panic. That is something else." He sipped his chai. "I do not care what you did in the Deccan. Every man who joins my caravan has a past he is running from. What matters is what he does now, in this moment, on this road."

"And if the Deshmukh's hunters find me? If they come for the reward?"

"Then I will tell them I never saw you. You will be long gone by then, one way or another." He smiled without warmth. "I am a trader, not a hero. But I repay my debts. You saved my caravan today. That debt is not small."

The chai steam curled up between us, smelling of milk and cardamom. I kept my eyes on it because meeting his would have been an act of faith I did not yet know how to make.

"We travel as far as Bijapur," Ismail Khan continued. "From there, you will have to find your own way south. But until then, you are under my protection. Keep your head wrapped, stay with the guards, and do not cause trouble. Can you do that?"

"Yes."

"Good." He gestured toward the tent flap. "Go. Get some sleep. Tomorrow we move at dawn."

I rose to leave, then stopped. "Why?" I asked. "You could turn me in. The reward would more than cover your losses from the attack."

Ismail Khan laughed softly. "I have been trading these roads for thirty years. I have learned that a man who will fight for strangers is worth more than gold. Gold can be spent. Loyalty cannot." He waved me away. "Go. Sleep. And in the morning, we will continue south."

I went. And for the first time since Sangamner, I slept without dreaming of the dead.

---

*The caravan wound through the Nizam's lands like a thread of commerce through a tapestry of war. I walked with the guards, watched the burned villages pass, listened to stories of the great powers that fought over this scarred earth. Marathas. Nizam. Mysore. Names that meant nothing to me, conflicts that had nothing to do with my own small tragedy.*

*But I was learning. Learning that the world was larger than my shame. Learning that even a man with his crimes branded on his face could find unexpected shelter among strangers.*

*Ismail Khan had called it loyalty. I did not know if I deserved that word. But I knew I would try to earn it.*

*The road south continued. The hunters were behind me. And somewhere ahead, in a kingdom I had never seen, a man named Ananthan Pillai waited - unknowing, perhaps unwilling, but my only hope nonetheless.*

*I walked toward him. It was all I could do.*
