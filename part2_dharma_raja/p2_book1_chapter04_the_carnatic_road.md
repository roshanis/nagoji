# Chapter 4: The Carnatic Road

Ismail Khan's caravan ended at Bijapur.

I stood at the edge of the camp on our last morning together, watching the merchants divide their goods for the different markets. Some would continue west to the coast. Others would turn east toward Hyderabad. Ismail Khan himself was heading north again, back through the territories we had crossed, carrying southern goods to the Deccan markets.

"You could come with me," he said, finding me by the camels. "I could use a man who fights like you. The pay would not be much, but it would be steady."

I shook my head. "I have to go south."

"Travancore." He said the name like it was a disease. "That is a long way, my friend. Through the Carnatic, through kingdoms I do not know. The Nawab of Arcot is a puppet of the English now. Mysore is a wolf waiting to devour everyone. And Travancore itself - they say the new king there is pious but weak, living in the shadow of his uncle's greatness."

"I have nowhere else to go."

Ismail Khan studied me for a long moment, then reached into his robe and produced a small purse. "Take this. It is not much, but it will keep you fed until Arcot. Beyond that..." He shrugged. "Beyond that, you will have to trust to God."

I took the purse. It was heavier than I expected. "I cannot repay this."

"You already have." He clasped my shoulder briefly. "Go with whatever god you pray to, Brahmin-killer. I hope you find what you are looking for."

He turned and walked back toward his camels, and I never saw him again.

The Carnatic was a different world.

I had grown up in the Deccan, where the land was brown and dry and the hills rose like bones from the earth. The Carnatic was flatter, greener in places, though the summer heat had burned the grass to yellow. The people spoke Tamil and Telugu instead of Marathi, and their temples were built in a style I did not recognise - towering pyramids of carved stone, painted in bright colours that hurt the eyes.

I walked south for two weeks, joining smaller caravans when I could, travelling alone when I could not. The further I went, the more the Deshmukh's name faded. No one in these lands had heard of the temple robbery, the murdered priest, the hundred gold mohurs. I was just another traveller, another refugee from the endless wars of the north.

The brand on my forehead still drew stares, but the stares were curious rather than accusatory. Here, the letters meant nothing. Few in the Carnatic could read Devanagari, and fewer still cared what a northern brand said. I told my story of the stable fire, and people nodded and looked away, uncomfortable with my disfigurement but not suspicious of it.

For the first time since Sangamner, I began to feel something like hope.

---

Arcot rose from the plains like a fever dream of power.

The city had been the seat of the Nawabs of the Carnatic for generations, a dynasty that had once ruled these lands in the name of the Mughals. Now, the Mughals were a memory and the Nawabs were something else - clients of the English East India Company, dependent on foreign soldiers and foreign gold to maintain their crumbling authority.

I saw the English before I reached the city gates.

There were soldiers on the road - sepoys, they called them, Indian men in English uniforms, carrying English muskets. They marched in formation, their boots raising dust, their officers mounted on horses that were too fine for this climate. The officers themselves were pale-skinned men with red faces, sweating in their woolen coats, shouting orders in a language I did not understand.

I stepped off the road to let them pass, keeping my head down and my face wrapped. They did not look at me. I was beneath their notice - just another native, just another piece of the landscape they were slowly consuming.

But I looked at them. I watched their discipline, their weapons, their casual arrogance. And I wondered what kind of men these were, who came from across the sea to fight in wars that were not their own.

---

The stables of Arcot saved me.

I had spent my money carefully, but Ismail Khan's purse was nearly empty by the time I reached the city. I needed work, and the only skill I had - the only honest skill - was with horses. My father had trained me well. Whatever else I had become, I could still gentle a frightened colt, still diagnose a lame hoof, still ride better than most men who had spent their lives in the saddle.

The stable master was a grizzled Tamil named Rangan who ran the largest livery in Arcot. He looked at my wrapped head, asked no questions, and set me to work mucking out stalls. The pay was barely enough to cover food and a corner of floor to sleep on, but it was honest work, and it kept me hidden from the eyes of anyone who might be looking.

I worked there for three weeks, learning the rhythms of the city while I waited for the right moment to continue south.

Arcot was a place of whispers and shadows. The Nawab, Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah, held court in a palace that had once been grand but was now slowly decaying. His power rested entirely on the English - their soldiers, their money, their ships that controlled the coast. Without them, he would be swept away by Mysore within a month.

Everyone knew this. The merchants knew it. The servants knew it. Even the Nawab himself knew it, though he pretended otherwise, holding elaborate durbars where he dispensed justice and received tribute as if he were still the master of his own fate.

The English knew it too. They treated the Nawab with elaborate courtesy and ignored his orders whenever it suited them. Their real master was a company of merchants in London, and their real purpose was trade - pepper and silk and saltpeter, flowing out of India and into English ships, returning as silver and steel and soldiers.

I watched and I listened and I learned. The world was larger than I had imagined, and the powers that shaped it were stranger than any I had known in my small village in the Deccan.

---

I heard about Travancore from a stable hand named Muthu.

He was a young man from the south, perhaps eighteen years old, working in Arcot to send money back to his family. We shared the corner of the stable where the workers slept, and in the evenings, after the horses were fed and watered, he would tell me stories of his homeland.

"Travancore is different," he said one night, his eyes bright with homesickness. "The king there - the one they call Marthanda Varma, though he is dead now - he broke the Dutch. Can you imagine? The Dutch, with their ships and their guns, and he broke them."

I had heard of the Dutch. They were like the English, traders who had come from across the sea, but older, established longer in the coastal kingdoms. "How did he break them?" I asked.

"At a place called Colachel. Twenty years ago, maybe more. The Dutch sent an army to conquer Travancore, and Marthanda Varma destroyed it. Captured their commander, took their guns, made them sign a treaty." Muthu grinned. "My grandfather saw the Dutch prisoners being marched through the streets. He said they looked like ghosts - white-skinned, bewildered, defeated by a king they had thought to conquer."

"And now? What is Travancore now?"

"Strong. The strongest kingdom in the south. The new king - Dharma Raja, they call him - he is not a warrior like his uncle, but he is wise. He has kept the peace, kept the English at bay, kept Mysore from swallowing him." Muthu shook his head admiringly. "Travancore is not like Arcot. In Travancore, the king is still the king."

I lay awake long after Muthu had fallen asleep, thinking about what he had said. A kingdom that had broken the Dutch. A king who was still the king. A place where power had not been surrendered to foreign merchants and foreign soldiers.

Perhaps my father had chosen well. Perhaps Travancore was a place where even a man like me could find a new beginning.

Or perhaps it was just another dream, another false hope in a life that had been full of them.

There was only one way to find out.

---

The hunters found me on my last night in Arcot.

I had grown careless. Three weeks of anonymity had dulled my vigilance, and I had begun to believe that the Deshmukh's reach truly did not extend this far south. I went to a chai stall outside the stable, unwrapping my head to let the evening breeze cool the scarred skin of my forehead.

A man was watching me.

He sat in the corner of the stall, nursing a cup he had not touched, his eyes fixed on my face. He was Maratha - I could tell by his clothes, his bearing, the way he held himself. And he was looking at the brand on my forehead with an expression I knew all too well.

Recognition.

Our eyes met. He smiled slowly.

I was on my feet and running before he could move.

---

The chase through Arcot lasted perhaps an hour.

I knew the streets better than he did - three weeks of living in a city teaches you its shortcuts and hiding places. But he was not alone. As I ran, I saw other men converging from side streets and alleyways, cutting off my escape routes. The Deshmukh had not sent one hunter. He had sent a pack.

I doubled back through the market, scattering baskets of fruit as I went. I ducked through a temple, emerging from a side door into a narrow alley. I climbed a wall and ran across rooftops, my father's training serving me in ways he had never imagined.

But they were closing in. Every turn I took, there were more of them. The Deshmukh had spent his gold well, and now it was paying off.

I found myself trapped in a dead-end alley, my back against a wall, three men blocking the only exit. They advanced slowly, confident, their swords drawn. The leader was the man from the chai stall, still smiling.

"The Deshmukh will be pleased," he said. "He has waited a long time for this."

I drew my knife - the plain one, not my father's blade. It felt small and useless against their swords.

"You can come quietly," the hunter continued. "Or we can hurt you first. The Deshmukh did not specify your condition, only that you be alive."

I said nothing. There was nothing to say.

And then the sepoys arrived.

---

They came around the corner in a squad of six, muskets at the ready, responding to reports of a disturbance in the market. Their sergeant - a havildar, I later learned - took one look at the scene and shouted an order. I heard one of the sepoys call him Raman.

"Weapons down! All of you!"

The hunters hesitated. They were Marathas in a city controlled by the Nawab and his English masters. They had no authority here, no protection. If they fought the sepoys, they would die or be imprisoned. If they surrendered, they would have to explain what they were doing chasing a man through the streets of Arcot.

"This is not your concern," the lead hunter said. "This man is a criminal. We are taking him back to face justice."

"Justice?" The havildar's eyes moved to my forehead, taking in the raised letters. "What justice brands a man before his execution?"

"He killed a Brahmin. A priest. And a nobleman's son."

Raman considered this. Then he shook his head. "Not in my city. Whatever he did, he did it somewhere else. Here, he is just another man. And you are disturbing the Nawab's peace."

The hunters exchanged glances. I could see them calculating odds, weighing options. Three swords against six muskets. It was not a fight they could win.

"This is not over," the leader said to me. "The Deshmukh will have his justice."

"Perhaps," Raman replied. "But not tonight. Now go, before I decide to arrest you for causing a riot."

They went. Slowly, reluctantly, their eyes promising violence to come. But they went.

Raman turned to me. "You should leave this city, friend. Tonight, if possible. They will come back, and next time there may not be sepoys nearby."

"I know." I sheathed my knife with shaking hands. "I am going south. Travancore."

"Travancore." He nodded slowly. "That is far. And the road passes through dangerous lands. Mysore is hungry, and the Nawab's protection does not extend beyond his borders."

"I know," I said again.

He studied my forehead for a long moment. "I cannot read Marathi, but I know a brand when I see one. Whatever you did, it must have been bad."

"It was."

"And yet you are still alive. Still running. Still hoping for something better." He shrugged. "Perhaps there is something to be said for that. Go south, branded man. And do not come back to Arcot."

I thanked him - though I am not sure he heard - and I disappeared into the night.

---

*I left Arcot before dawn, carrying only what I could fit in a pack. The hunters would be watching the roads, but I knew paths they did not - stable hands learn many things, and Muthu had told me of a route through the hills that would bypass the main gates.*

*Behind me, the city slept, unaware of the small drama that had played out in its streets. The Nawab dreamed of glory. The English dreamed of profit. The hunters dreamed of the reward they had almost claimed.*

*And I walked south, toward Travancore, toward a man named Ananthan Pillai, toward whatever fate awaited me in the kingdom that had broken the Dutch.*

*The brand on my forehead burned in the cool morning air. Three ghosts walked beside me. But I was still alive, still moving, still hoping for something I could not name.*

*The road to Travancore lay ahead. I had nothing left but the road.*

*I walked.*
