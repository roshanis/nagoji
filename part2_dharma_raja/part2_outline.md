# Blood and Thrones, Part 2: Dharma Raja

## Working Title: Tiger's Heir

### Core Premise

Bhalerao, the ruined son of Dhanaji, is an opium addict who robs a temple and kills both the pujari and the Deshmukh's son who tries to stop him. Before execution, "BRAHMIN-KILLER" is burned into his forehead with a hot iron - his shame seared into flesh. He is rescued at the execution ground by his father - who dies in his place. Carrying three deaths, unbearable guilt, and a scar that announces his crime to everyone he meets, Bhalerao flees south with his father's letter and the jeweled knife Nagoji once gave Dhanaji. Hunted across the Nizam's territories, he makes his way through Arcot and arrives in Travancore as the lowest form of man - a temple defiler, a priest-killer, a father-killer, wearing his shame burned into his face. Where his father found purpose through discipline and patience, Bhalerao must claw his way back from the abyss in a kingdom facing existential threats from Mysore, Tipu Sultan, and the rising British power.

Along the way, he falls in love with a Syrian Catholic refugee fleeing Tipu's religious persecution in Malabar, builds a life that defies the rigid boundaries of caste and faith, saves the life of his king on a battlefield near Alleppey, captures Tipu's tiger flag in Kerala, and ultimately rides with the British to storm Seringapatam and watch the Tiger of Mysore fall.

### Series Position

- **Part 1, Marthanda Varma (1738-1753):** Horse of the Servant - Nagoji Sawant's transformation from prisoner to general, the defeat of the Dutch, the building of Travancore.
- **Part 2, Dharma Raja (1760-1799):** Tiger's Heir - Bhalerao's journey from fugitive to commander during the reign of Dharma Raja, the Mysore wars, Tipu's invasion, and the final siege of Seringapatam.

### Time Period

1760-1799, covering:
- The reign of Dharma Raja (Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma, r. 1758-1798)
- The rise and fall of Hyder Ali
- The emergence of Tipu Sultan
- Tipu's fanaticism and persecution of Christians in Malabar
- The Anglo-Mysore Wars (all four)
- Tipu's invasion of Travancore (1789-1790)
- The Siege of Seringapatam and Tipu's death (1799)

### Narrator

**Bhalerao**, son of Dhanaji, telling his story in first person past tense like his predecessor Nagoji.

Unlike Nagoji's measured, tactical voice, Bhalerao's narration is:
- Rougher, more impulsive
- Prone to dark humor and bitter self-loathing
- Gradually maturing across the four books
- Haunted by unbearable guilt - the pujari he killed, the Deshmukh's son, and above all, his father who died saving him
- The voice of a man clawing his way back from the lowest point a man can fall
- Deeply affected by his love for a woman his world says he should not love

- Forced conversion of Hindus and Syrian Christians to Islam
- Mass deportations to Mysore (estimated 30,000-60,000 people)
- Destruction of churches and Christian institutions
- The Syrian Catholics of Malabar suffered terribly
- This creates the refugee crisis that brings Mariam into the story

### De Lannoy's Legacy

Historical: Eustachius De Lannoy died in 1777 and is buried at Udayagiri. He had children who continued in Travancore service, though details are sparse. The fictional Hendrik and Caspar represent this continuation.

### British Officers at Seringapatam

Historical figures present at the 1799 siege included:
- General George Harris (commander)
- Colonel Arthur Wellesley (later Duke of Wellington)
- General David Baird (led the final assault)

The fictional British characters (Stuart, Blackwood, Doyle) represent different types of Company officers.

## Thematic Connections to Part 1

1. **Legacy and Inheritance**: Nagoji arrived as wreckage from a storm; Bhalerao arrives as wreckage from his own choices - both must be remade
2. **The Depth of the Fall**: Nagoji was tortured by enemies; Bhalerao destroyed himself - his redemption must come from deeper
3. **Violence and Purpose**: Nagoji learned to use violence strategically; Bhalerao must first learn that violence without purpose destroyed him
4. **Fathers and Sons**: Nagoji became a father in Travancore; Bhalerao's story begins with his father's death for his sins
5. **The Cost of Kingdoms**: Revathi's role as "the one who remembers" passes to Bhalerao - but he carries more ghosts than she ever did
6. **Outsiders and Belonging**: Both narrators are Marathas who become Travancore men
7. **European Powers**: Dutch in Part 1, British in Part 2 - same question of how to survive
8. **Forbidden Love**: Nagoji and Revathi crossed social boundaries; Bhalerao and Mariam cross religious ones - both find that love does not erase the past
9. **The Chapel at Udayagiri**: Father Duarte and De Lannoy's faith in Part 1 echoes in Mariam's faith and the De Lannoy sons in Part 2; Bhalerao, who killed a priest, finds unexpected grace through a priest's daughter

## Writing Notes

### Voice Differentiation

Bhalerao's voice should be distinct from Nagoji's:
- More impulsive, less measured
- Uses coarser language, rougher metaphors
- More prone to self-criticism and dark humor
- Gradually matures across the four books
- When speaking of Mariam, his voice softens

### Mariam's Characterization

- Not a passive victim or love interest
- Survivor who carries her own trauma
- Educated, multilingual, practical
- Her faith is real but not preachy
- She challenges Bhalerao intellectually
- Their relationship is a partnership of equals

### The British

- Avoid simple heroes or villains
- Stuart represents professional soldiering with some honor
- Blackwood represents the corruption that will grow
- Doyle represents the common soldier caught in empire
- The overall trajectory is clear: British "help" becomes British control

### Pacing

- Book I: Picaresque adventure with action set pieces
- Book II: Political and military drama, romance, character development
- Book III: War narrative, high stakes, maximum tension, loss
- Book IV: Reflection, final reckoning, ambiguous triumph

### Recurring Motifs

- The brand - "BRAHMIN-KILLER" burned into his forehead; scar tissue that never heals, shame seared into flesh
- The jeweled knife - stolen from his dead father, a reminder of what he cost Dhanaji
- The letter from Dhanaji - Bhalerao rereads it at key moments; words from a father who died for him
- Blood on hands - literal and metaphorical; the pujari, the Deshmukh's son, his father, and all who follow
- Three ghosts - the priest, the young man, and Dhanaji haunt Bhalerao's memory
- Opium's shadow - Bhalerao's addiction is conquered but never forgotten; he understands weakness
- The house Bhalerao builds - symbol of what he's fighting for, proof he can create not just destroy
- Monsoon - arrives at crucial moments, as in Part 1
- Fire - villages burning, from Deccan to Malabar to Seringapatam
- Tipu's tiger flag - captured in Kerala, becomes symbol of survival
