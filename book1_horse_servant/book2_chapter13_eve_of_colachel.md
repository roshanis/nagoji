# Chapter 13: The Eve of Colachel

The day before Colachel smelled of coconut smoke and rain that had not yet fallen.

Clouds had gathered over the sea since morning, thick and low, their underbellies a dark grey that matched the mood along the coast. The air was heavy, each breath like drinking warm water. Even the waves seemed to roll in with less enthusiasm, as if waiting for something.

We waited with them.

Reports had come in all day.

From the boy on the palm tower came word of Dutch ships shifting their positions offshore, boats running between them and the coast, sails furled and unfurled like nervous fingers.

Ibrahim and his Marakkar cousins sent tidings of supply craft cut loose in the night, anchors sabotaged, small fires flickering briefly on distant decks.

Messengers from inland chiefs spoke of men mustering, some eager, some sullen; grain moved toward the fort; rumours of certain houses grumbling that this was not their quarrel.

Kottarakkara sent nothing. A silence that Ramayyan noted without comment, his stylus pausing over the name before moving on. When I asked about it, he only said, “Some absences speak louder than presence.” Padmini, overhearing, made a sound that was not quite a laugh. “The Thekkumkur Raja counts Dutch masts and waits to see which way the wind blows. Savitri in Kottarakkara writes letters to Velinadu asking whether this is the moment.” She did not say what moment. She did not need to.

Velinadu replied with a formal message from Revathi Bayi, saying she would remain within her halls, Velinadu men ready to move if the Dutch threatened their share of the coast. The words were correct, empty of warmth. Padmini read them twice. “She is watching too,” she murmured. “Watching to see whether her king is worth her kinswoman's silence.”

Padmini Amma moved through all of this like a pivot.

In the morning, she was in her fields, walking the bunds with bare feet despite the heat, speaking to men and women who bent over pepper vines. She told them which plants would be stripped early to feed troops and which would be left to ripen for trade, a calculation that balanced war and future harvest.

“You will not take the vines on that ridge,” she told one village headman. “If the Dutch burn the lower fields, we will still have pepper to sell them at higher prices when they crawl back.”

He blinked, then grinned.

“Always thinking of profit, Amma,” he said.

“Profit is survival written in accounts,” she replied. “Go. Make sure the granaries are locked. If any man tries to sell grain to a company agent at the old price tomorrow, I will make him eat dust for a month.”

By noon, she was at the fort, her stick tapping stone as she walked along the ramparts.

“The walls will hold,” she said, more to herself than to me. “If the men do.”

In the afternoon, she sat in a small room near the war hall, counting out cloth and grain for the families of men who would ride or march at dawn.

“We do not let our soldiers worry about whether their children will eat while they face Dutch guns,” she said. “Fear is heavy enough without empty stomachs.”

By sunset, she was back at her estate, watching as boys carried oil to the temple, as women lit lamps in doorways, as the shadows lengthened.

“You will ride from here in the morning,” she told me, standing under the jackfruit tree where so many of our conversations had begun. “Your horses will leave hoofprints in my yard. Do not waste them.”

“I will try not to trample anything you wish to keep,” I said.

“The sea and the Dutch will trample more than you ever could,” she said. “Just make sure that when they do, they taste sand with it.”

While she moved through her layers of responsibility, I moved through mine.

In the coastal training ground, I rode with the Madurai and Maravar horsemen one last time before the real test. We had been drilling for months, so we did not run full drills. It was too late to teach new tricks. Instead, we rode slowly along the wet sand, letting the horses feel the ground under different tides.

Ponnan kept his horse a half length from mine, as he often did now, close enough to hear, far enough to pretend distance.

“Tomorrow we do not have the luxury of turning when we please,” he said. “They will fire when it suits them, not us.”

“Then make the sand your ally before their powder speaks,” I said. “You and your men read this beach better than any Deccan rider.”

He snorted softly.

“If we live through this, Sawant, I will decide whether to be flattered,” he said.

“Remember,” I told them all, “you do not have to kill every Dutchman to win. You have to break their line, their nerve, their belief that you will always fall before their guns. If you survive one volley and reach them still moving, half their courage will die before any man does.”

Raza Khan adjusted his turban.

“We have fought men with guns before,” he said. “But we have not fought men who think their God has given them all the guns that matter.”

“Then we teach their God some humility,” I said.

Later, in the fort courtyard, I walked among the Nair footsoldiers.

They sat cleaning muskets, checking powder flasks, tying talismans around their wrists and arms. Some muttered mantras under their breath. Others joked too loudly, voices a shade too high.

I stopped near a group of young men who had drilled under the European instructor and under Deccan cavalry eyes both.

“You have seen their ships now,” I said. “Do they look like gods?”

One laughed, nervously.

“They look like houses turned on their sides,” he said. “With too many sticks.”

“And the men on them?” I asked.

“They look like men,” another said. “Too pale. Too stiff.”

“Good,” I said. “Remember that when they fire. Their powder burns the same. Their blood spills the same. Their screams sound the same when steel touches them.”

In the war hall, maps lay open again.

Marthanda Varma studied them with that same stillness I had come to recognise, the kind that meant all his thinking had narrowed to a fine point. Beside him stood a man I had seen only fleetingly, Mathoo Tharakan, a Syrian Christian merchant from the north with eyes as sharp as Ramayyan’s stylus. He wore the simple white cloth of his people, but the gold cross at his neck and the deference the Dalawa showed him spoke of his standing.

“They are here because their books are bleeding,” Marthanda Varma said, his finger tracing the coastline on the map. He glanced at the merchant. “They are angry that we swallow the pepper states. They are angry that we refuse their contracts and sell instead through men like Tharakan here. They are angry that the profit stays in Syrian and Nair purses instead of flowing to Batavia.”

Tharakan inclined his head. “Their anger is cheaper than their pepper, Your Highness. Let them keep it.”

He looked up, his eyes hard.

“They expect to march inland, burn a few villages, perhaps even threaten the capital, and force us to sign whatever paper they shove in front of us.”

Ramayyan moved a token, a small Dutch coin, onto the sand of Colachel.

I had learned by then not to mistake him for a clerk. I had seen him lead men against Kollam and the Desinganadu coalition, breaking their lines with the same precision he used to balance accounts. He understood supply routes the way a river pilot understands currents: where grain could flow, where it would pool, where it would run dry. The best generals I had known in the Deccan were the ones who could count rice bags as easily as enemy banners. Ramayyan could do both without looking up from his palm leaves.

"They are overconfident," the Dalawa said. "And they are alone. Our spies in Sri Lanka say the Governor there has stripped his garrisons to send this force. They expect reinforcements from Batavia, but they will not come."

“Why not?” I asked.

"The Java War," Ramayyan said, a rare hint of satisfaction in his voice. "The Dutch are busy fighting their own fires in the east. They cannot spare men for a pepper feud in Travancore. What sits on that beach is all they have."

He pulled out a worn palm leaf, covered in his precise script.

"Let me tell you what Van Imhoff planned," he said. "Because understanding a man's strategy reveals his blindness."

The Dalawa traced a line along the coast.

"His plan was simple. Blockade every port from Kollam to Kanyakumari. Stop all pepper exports. Strangle the chumkam."

"Chumkam?" I asked.

"The tax on imports and exports," Tharakan said, his merchant's voice sharpening. "Every bag of pepper that leaves this coast, every bolt of cloth, every measure of cardamom - the crown takes its share. It is the main source of the Maharaja's income. More than land revenue. More than temple taxes. Van Imhoff thought if he could cut the chumkam, the treasury would empty within months. No treasury, no army. No army, no war."

"A sailor's strategy," Varma said. "He thinks like a man who has spent his life on ships. Control the sea, control the trade. But he forgets that pepper has legs."

Ramayyan smiled thinly.

"The centres of the pepper and cloth industry are not on the coast. They are inland, at Kottar, between Colachel and Kalkulam. From there, transport to Madurai and the Coromandel coast is easy. Overland. The Dutch can blockade our harbours until their ships rot, but they cannot stop a bullock cart."

"So we moved the trade," Tharakan added. "Syrian Christian merchants have been walking pepper east through the passes for months now. The Dutch sit on their roadsteads watching empty beaches while our goods reach Madurai and beyond."

"Van Imhoff does not understand inland trade," Ramayyan said. "His career taught him to think in terms of harbours and roadsteads. He never learned that a region like this has arteries the sea cannot touch."

I remembered the long months leading to this moment.

Last November, Dutch ships had appeared off Colachel and bombarded the town for three days. The inhabitants fled. Houses burned. The harbour was blocked. We thought it was the invasion, but they sailed away when the northeast monsoon made landing impossible. It was only a message, written in salt and ash: we can reach you.

In February, they came back. Stein van Gollenesse led the fleet from Kochi. Four hundred men landed on the beach at dawn, covered by ship cannons firing at our positions. Twenty-two Dutch dead, seventeen wounded. Our men scattered into the dunes and palm forests, regrouped, and began the slow work of encirclement.

What followed was not war as the Deccan knew it. It was a strangling.

The Dutch attacked Tengapattanam next, burning houses and temples, taking prisoners. Women and children dragged to the ships. Ramayyan had shown me the intelligence reports, his face carved from stone as he read them.

"They sold prisoners as slaves," he had said. "Twelve and a half rixdollars for anyone over fourteen. Twenty rixdollars for a Nair, because Nairs are worth more to the Batavia markets. Children younger than fourteen, the soldiers kept for themselves."

The Jesuits at Colachel had protested. The Dutch locked five of them in a ship's cabin, claiming it was for their protection. Some escaped and brought us intelligence: the fortress the Dutch were building had bastions made of mud that collapsed when they mounted cannon. There was no drinking water inside the walls. Provisions were rotting in the open air because they had no warehouse. The soldiers were falling sick.

"Their own engineer, a man named Leslorant, cannot decide what he wants," Karl August had reported. He was our eyes inside the Dutch mind, a German deserter who knew their methods. "He builds today, demolishes tomorrow. The bastions are too small for the artillery. When they put nine cannons on the walls, the weight made them collapse."

"And their commander?" I had asked.

"Hackert." Karl August spat the name. "He left. Took most of the ships, the rice, the gunpowder, the ammunition. Sailed to Tuticorin in May and left a lieutenant named Rijtel behind with two hundred and fifty Europeans, fifty lascars, and two ensigns. They have provisions for days, not weeks."

That was the force we faced now. Not the grand army Van Imhoff had envisioned, but a skeleton garrison abandoned by its own commanders, building a fortress that fell apart under its own guns, drinking arrack because the water tank was never finished.

The coalition that had supported the Dutch was fracturing too.

"The princess-regent of Nedumangadu sent the Dutch a desperate letter in September," Ramayyan said. "She begged them to help her immediately because she could not hold out an hour against us. She asked them to rescue her younger brother, still imprisoned by us, forbidden to correspond with her, barely fed."

"And the Dutch?" I asked.

"Refused. They had other plans." Ramayyan's voice was flat. "They wanted to use her as a lever, not save her. When she was no longer useful, they abandoned her. Desinganadu is the same. He promised to fight us, then stopped his campaign because of a festival. A festival. The man halts a war so his soldiers can sacrifice cocks to Bhadrakali."

The king looked up from the map.

"Coalitions built on Dutch coin fall apart when the coin stops flowing. The princess-regent has no power. Desinganadu has no loyalty. The chiefs who joined them are already sending quiet messages to our court, asking whether we might forgive past mistakes."

"Two thousand men," Varma said now, returning to the present. "Professional soldiers. Good muskets. Cannon."

“Against our thousands,” I said. “If we charge them,”

“No charge,” Varma cut in. “Not yet. We do not spend men to prove we are brave. We spend them to win.”

He pointed to the map again.

“We pin them,” he said. “I have raised two thousand extra levies from the southern districts. We move them here, and here. Block the outcome to the inland road. Force them back onto the sand.”

“A siege?” I asked. “On an open beach?”

“A prison without walls,” Ramayyan corrected. “We dig in. We build batteries. We squeeze them against the sea.”

“And the sea?” I asked. “They have ships. They can resupply. They can leave.”

“Not if the water is as hostile as the land,” Varma said. “I have spoken to the Mukkuvar headmen. The fishermen. They know every rock and current. At night, the sea will belong to them, not the Dutch ships.”

He looked at me.

“Your horsemen will not charge a line, Nagoji. You will be the bars of the cage. You will patrol the perimeter. Capture their scouts. Cut off their foraging parties. Make sure that once they step onto that beach, they never step off it unless in chains.”

It was a colder plan than a dawn charge. It lacked the glory of a thunderous collision, but it carried the ruthless weight of certainty.

“We will starve them,” I said. “And bleed them.”

“We will break them,” Varma said. “Slowly. Until they realise that their monopoly is worth less than their lives.”

Night came down slowly.

The clouds that had hung low all day finally let go a thin drizzle, just enough to sharpen the smell of earth and sea. Before the last orders went out, the temple near the fort held a special puja.

Not the noisy, sprawling festival of harvest or marriage, but a focused, tight ceremony meant to steady hands that would hold weapons at dawn. Oil lamps were set in long rows along the outer wall. Men and women moved past them with cupped palms, touching each flame lightly, then pressing that faint heat to their eyelids and chests.

Padmini stood near the inner gate, handing small packets of kumkum and ash to any soldier who wished to take them. Some men tied the cloth around their wrists, others tucked it into their belts. A few, mostly Madurai horsemen, hung back, respectful but wary of unfamiliar gods.

Ibrahim brought a small brass lamp from the mosque by the shore and set it discreetly near the temple steps, the light from it mingling with the others.

“The sea does not care whose name you call when it takes you,” he murmured to me. “Best to have several listening.”

Raza Khan stood apart with his Madurai men, their hands pressed together in their own way towards Mecca, their lips moving in prayers that belonged to other lands. We had all come from somewhere else. Tomorrow we would bleed into the same sand.

“You think they pray on those ships?” Ibrahim asked, nodding toward the dark line of the sea.

“They pray to their god and their profit,” I said. “I do not know which they trust more.”

“We will find out tomorrow,” he said.

When the last chant faded and the priests banked the central flame, the air in the courtyard felt thicker, not with smoke, but with the weight of what had been asked and promised in whispers. Lamps flickered on one by one in houses and halls. In the temple courtyards, priests chanted louder than usual, as if hoping their gods could be persuaded to pay special attention in the morning.

Back at Padmini Amma's estate, a quiet settled that felt almost like the pause between inhaling and exhaling.

Men who would normally have gathered to talk after supper sat with their families instead, fingers tracing outlines on children's faces, hands resting a little longer on wives' shoulders. Women moved with restless energy, checking and rechecking that rice jars were full, that lamps had enough oil, that clothes for mourning lay where they could be found if needed.

Under the jackfruit tree, Dhanaji, one of my senior riders from the Deccan who had survived Goa's dungeons alongside me, sat sharpening his talwar.

“You ever think you would be here, sahib?” he asked, using the old title out of habit. “At the edge of a southern sea, about to ride at Dutch guns for a king who is not yours?”

“The gods have poor handwriting,” I said. “If they wrote this in my horoscope, the astrologer must have fallen asleep.”

He chuckled, then grew serious.

“The men trust you,” he said. “They grumble about sand and salt, but when you say 'ride', they will.”

“That is what frightens me,” I said.

He looked up, surprised.

“You are not afraid of Dutch guns?” he asked.

“Guns I understand,” I said. “Men who follow because they believe you see further than they do, that is a weight I am still learning how to carry.”

Dhanaji's gaze softened.

“You carried it on the Godavari,” he said. “You carried it when we hit Portuguese caravans. You carried it when you chose to jump from that ship and leave a boy behind rather than let both of you drown for nothing. Do not pretend this is new.”

The mention of Keshavrao landed like a stone in my chest.

“It feels different here,” I said. “There, we rode for hills we knew. For forts that had our banners. Here, I ride for a king I have known only a short while, on land whose gods I do not fully understand.”

“The bullets will not stop to ask whose gods you prayed to,” Dhanaji said. “You ride for the man you chose when you did not run north. That is enough for now.”

Padmini appeared then, her stick making no sound on the damp earth, as if she knew better than to disturb the night's heavy silence.

“You men speak of guns and gods,” she said, stepping into the circle of lantern light. “But there are older powers to reckon with before the sun rises.”

She looked at me. “Come, Nagoji. There is one place you must visit. A place few eyes outside our bloodline have seen.”

I glanced at Dhanaji, who nodded slightly, sensing a dismissal. I rose and followed her.

She led me away from the house, past the granaries and the sleeping quarters of the servants, toward a dense thicket of trees that loomed like a dark island at the edge of the estate. As we approached, the air grew cooler, smelling of wet stone, camphor, and rotting leaves. The canopy overhead was so thick it blotted out the few stars that had managed to pierce the clouds.

“This is the *Sarpa Kavu*,” Padmini whispered. “The Abode of Snakes.”

We stepped into the grove, and a cold prickle of dread ran down my spine. The hairs on my arms rose as the air thickened. Roots coiled over the ground like solidified serpents. In the centre, beneath a massive tree that seemed to hold up the sky itself, a small stone clearing opened up. Large termite mounds rose from the earth like natural stupas, the ancient homes of the serpents, flanked by hundreds of granite idols. Snakes with hoods spread, coiled bodies, singular and intertwined, stood in silent vigil.

Revathi Bayi was there, lighting a small oil lamp at the foot of the largest idol. She stood wrapped in a shawl against the damp air, her face illuminated by the flickering flame.

“It is a secret place,” Revathi said softly, her voice blending with the rustle of leaves. “Only the immediate family of Padmini Amma's *tharavadu* may walk here freely. To bring a stranger is to ask the Naga Rajas to witness him.”

“He rides for us,” Padmini said, bowing her head before the stone serpents. “He needs their permission to bleed on their earth.”

Revathi gestured to the idols. “Do you understand the significance of this, Nagoji? This house is one of the oldest in the state. Before there were kings in Padmanabhapuram, before the Dutch sailed their wooden islands, this grove was here. We do not cut a single branch. We do not sweep the leaves. We let the Nagas rule this darkness so that they might let us rule the light.”

“We ask for their blessing,” Padmini added. “Not for glory, but for venom. The stillness that strikes.”

I bowed, feeling the weight of the centuries in that small, shadowed clearing. The silence here was not empty; it was watchful.

“There is a moment,” Revathi said, looking past the idols into the dark, “before every great event, when the land holds its breath. Birds become quiet. Even the wind hesitates. This is that moment. The Naga lords are listening.”

“You will ride tomorrow,” she continued, her eyes finding mine. “Songs will be written about men like you. But remember, we do not shout our war cries here. We endure. We bend until men think we will break, then we stand up again. That is the lesson of the snake.”

Padmini touched the ground, then her forehead. “Pray, Nagoji. Ask that your strike be true.”

I closed my eyes, the smell of the damp earth filling my lungs. I did not pray for victory. I prayed for the focus of the cobra, the patience of the stone.

When I opened my eyes, I was alone with Revathi. Padmini had slipped away, perhaps to the supply wagons, or perhaps simply to give us this moment.

“Good,” Revathi said, her voice trembling slightly. “Now go. Sleep if you can.”

The vulnerability in her tone broke my resolve. I stepped forward and pulled her into a tight embrace. She did not resist; she melted against me, her body soft and shaking, tears dampening my shoulder. For a heartbeat, the war vanished. I did not care about the King or the Dutch or the damp gunpowder waiting in the fort. I only wanted to remain here, anchoring myself to this woman, for a lifetime.

“If I survive,” I whispered into her hair, the words fighting their way past the lump in my throat, “we will have a conversation about queens and guests. But not tonight.”

She pressed her forehead briefly against my neck, breath warm on my skin, then pulled back just far enough to look at me.

“You do not get to die cheaply now,” she said, voice rough. “Not with unfinished words between us.”

“Then I will try to live expensively,” I said, attempting a smile that did not quite reach my own eyes.

“Nagoji?” Dhanaji’s voice echoed from near the house, sharp and questioning.

Revathi pulled back, wiping her cheeks swiftly. She looked at me, a sad, knowing smile touching her lips. Then she stepped closer again, her voice dropping to a whisper that carried the sharp edge of a blade.

“And Nagoji... if you die tomorrow, die facing the right direction. Do not give the Dutch the satisfaction of seeing your back.”

She hesitated, her fingers brushing one of the stone serpents.

“And if you live,” she murmured, barely louder than the rustle of leaves, “do not make me a widow for a king I did not choose.”

She turned back to the idols, leaving only the memory of her fragrance hanging in the humid air to torture me.

Padmini guided me back to the edge of the grove when I emerged. “The dawn will not wait,” she said, appearing from the shadows. “Rest now.”

When I finally lay down on the mat Padmini's people had given me, sleep came in fragments.

In one fragment, I was again in the Goan dungeon, chains cold against my skin. In another, I was on the storm struck ship, rope burning my hands as Keshavrao vanished into the black water. In a third, I was on that wet strip of sand, horses pounding beside me, Dutch muskets spitting fire, and through the smoke, Revathi’s sorrowful smile watching me.

In the last fragment before dawn, I stood alone on a beach that was both Colachel and not, the sea on one side, the fort on the other, the sound of drums carrying on the wind.

When the real drums began, calling men to arms in the grey before sunrise, they sounded exactly like the ones in my dream.

The eve was over.

The storm was here.
