# Chapter 14: The Siege of Colachel

In 1741, by the time we closed our ring around Colachel, we were already tired from another war.

The Dutch had not come when Travancore was fresh and waiting. They chose their moment while the Maharaja was far to the south, near the tip of the land, wrestling with Chanda Sahib's men and the Madurai claim on Anchuthengu. The army had marched and bled along that front, coin had already been turned into borrowed muskets and English favours, and Ramayyan's palm leaves were full of debts instead of spare plans. When company flags finally showed themselves off Colachel, they were not striking a king who had been building his sand batteries in peace. They were striking a man who had only just pushed one invader back and had not yet found his footing again.

They had already tested this coast the previous November. Their ships had sat offshore like patient carrion and shelled Colachel for days, then slipped away into rough water, leaving burned huts and a warning written in salt and ash. The siege that followed was only the longer version of that same message.

The first days were confusion.

Messages galloped up and down the coast. Men who had thought they were going home from the southern campaign found themselves turned north instead. Guns that had faced Chanda Sahib's lines were dragged through wet fields and narrow village paths toward this new beachhead. For a short, sharp time, the Dutch had what they wanted: Travancore stretched, its king fighting on two fronts, its lines thin.

Their confidence had not come from the sea alone. Two years before Colachel, the company had decided to stop being a guest at our table. They reached for the oldest weapon on this coast, a royal house divided. They took up the grievance of the Elayadathu line at Kottarakkara, a princess pushed aside when Varma interfered in her house's succession, and they promised her Dutch support in return for pepper signed cheap under her seal. Desinganadu, Kochi, Purakkad, Thekkumkur, each nursing its own wounds, were quick to stand under that foreign umbrella. Their men struck from the north while Dutch ships bit at the south, and for a few months blue coats sat in villages from Kottar to the edges of Colachel as if Padmanabhapuram were already within reach.

Only when those scattered strands were pulled together did the battle settle into its true shape.

The war became a weight, not a collision.

There was no grand charge, no thunder of hooves on wet sand as I had imagined in restless sleep. Instead, there was the slow, grinding work of earth and patience.

For weeks, we pinned them against the sea.

Our lines curved around their beachhead like a tightening noose. We dug trenches in the sandy soil, reinforcing them with palm trunks and woven mats. We raised batteries of cannon that pounded their impromptu stockade day and night. We watched them through the haze of heat and salt spray, a blue and grey mass of men shrinking into an ever-smaller patch of ground.

“They are stubborn,” Dhanaji muttered one morning, wiping sweat from his eyes as we watched a fresh plume of smoke rise from their camp. “Most men would have swum for the ships by now.”

“They are waiting for help that is not coming,” I said. “And they are afraid to admit that the great Dutch East India Company has been trapped by a king they thought was a petty chieftain.”

Strategy had shifted, just as Varma had promised.

My riders did not charge squares. We became the gaolers of the perimeter. Ponnan’s Maravar horse wove through scrub and low palms, closing gaps my Deccan eyes would have missed, while Madurai and Maratha riders watched the wider tracks.

We patrolled the scrub inland, catching the desperate few who tried to slip out to forage for food. We rode down their scouts. We cut off the trickle of fresh water from the inland streams.

But the true strangeness of this war was that it had two fronts: the land where we stood, and the sea where the fishermen ruled.

Late one night, I went down to the water’s edge, away from our main batteries.

The moon was hidden behind monsoon clouds. The sea was a black, heaving mass. It should have been empty; no sane man sailed these waters in the dark during the rains.

But it was alive.

Shadows moved on the surf. Low, narrow boats, blackened with soot, slipped through the waves with barely a splash. The Mukkuvar men, their bodies oiled to slip through water and grip rope and hull alike, were going to work.

A group of them returned, dragging their craft up the sand. They were grinning, their teeth white in the gloom.

“Good fishing?” I asked one of the headmen, a scarred man named Antony.

He spat a stream of betel juice into the sand.

“Very good, Ayya,” he said. “We found a supply boat trying to come in from a ship further out. It has a hole in its hull now. The rice is for the fish.”

“And the crew?”

“Some swam,” he said with a shrug. “The sea is hungry tonight.”

He gestured to the dark water.

“They do not understand,” he said. “They think big ships make them masters. But big ships must anchor. And anchors act like tethers for goats. We swim out, we cut, we drill. They are fighting the ocean, and the ocean is on our side.”

It was a terrifyingly efficient alliance. On land, Ramayyan’s batteries hammered their walls. At sea, Ibrahim’s divers and boatmen bled their supplies and nerves. The Dutch were trapped in a box where the walls were fire and the floor was water.

In late May, when the siege tightened and the air began to taste of rain, Varma rode north to Tiruvattar and begged Adi Kesava Swami for success. He returned without ceremony and ordered the trenches pushed closer.

Before we pinned them here, their mud ramparts had already sagged under the weight of their own guns, and an early storm had torn some of their anchors away. Hackert, the commander they had trusted to lead them, had gone north with fresh troops, leaving Lieutenant Rijtel to hold this shrinking patch of sand with sick men and empty barrels.

Yet they held.

Their officers kept them disciplined. From a distance, a tall figure paced the perimeter of their shrinking fort, shifting men to plug gaps, rationing their dwindling food, keeping their muskets firing though the volleys grew more ragged as powder ran low.

"They are stubborn," Ramayyan admitted one evening, looking over the casualty reports. "Good officers, wasted on a merchant's war."

"They think they serve their nation," Varma said. The king sat on a camp stool, sharpening a small knife, his eyes on the distant Dutch fires.

"They serve a company," Ramayyan corrected. "Merchants who will check the cost of their rescue against the price of pepper and decide they are too expensive."

The end, when it came, arrived on a wind from the sea.

It was the 10th of August. The sun had broken through the clouds, baking the wet sand until the air shimmered. The smell of the siege, unburied waste and rotting fish mixed with burnt powder, hung heavy over everything.

Our batteries had been firing sluggishly all morning. The heat made the gunners slow.

I thought of Karl August's charcoal marks on Ramayyan's leaf, the little shaded square he had drawn where powder and rice lay too close together for anyone's comfort.

“Wake them up,” I told a Nair captain. “If the Dutch think we are sleeping, they might try a sortie.”

He shouted an order. A crew on the main battery, nearest the beach, sponged their piece and rammed a charge home. They adjusted the elevation, squinting against the glare, aligning the barrel by habit toward the heart of the fort where Ramayyan had quietly told them the enemy kept its teeth.

I do not believe in luck. I believe in preparation meeting opportunity. But sometimes, war throws dice.

The gun fired. A puff of white smoke. A dull thud.

We watched the ball arc through the air, a dark speck against the bright sky. It cleared the outer wall of the Dutch stockade. It cleared the line of tents where their sick lay.

It dropped with the precision of a hawk into the centre of their camp.

For a heartbeat, nothing happened.

Then the world turned white.

A roar, deeper and louder than any thunder, punched the air. It knocked men off their feet in our forward trenches. My horse reared, screaming. I fought to control him, my own ears ringing, the breath driven from my lungs by the shockwave.

A pillar of flame stood over the Dutch camp. It climbed higher and higher, boiling with black smoke, debris spinning in its heart like leaves in a cyclone.

"The magazine," Dhanaji screamed, his voice sounding thin through the ringing in my ears. "They hit the powder room." The church, Karl August had said, turned into a storehouse because stone walls keep damp out better than canvas. Fire swept through the stockade, hungry and fast, fed by the wind. We could see tiny figures running, flailing. We could hear the pops of muskets cooking off in the heat, small echoes of the great blast.

Secondary explosions rippled out, barrels of powder, grenades, anything that could burn. The structures they had built, the food they had hoarded, the shelter they had clung to, all of it was being consumed.

I thought the explosion would break them. I was wrong.

Through the smoke and flame, I saw movement. Blue coats, grey coats, emerged from the wreckage. Not fleeing. Forming.

“They're coming out,” Dhanaji shouted.

And they were. The Dutch infantry poured through the gaps in their burning walls, muskets levelled, bayonets fixed. Even with their fort destroyed, their supplies gone, their powder scattered, they came out fighting.

Their first volley caught our forward trenches. Men fell. The ragged line of blue-coats advanced through the smoke, firing and reloading with the mechanical precision of men who had drilled until the motions lived in their bones.

“Hold!” Ramayyan's voice carried over the chaos. “Hold the centre!”

The Nair infantry braced, their swords and spears forming a wall against the bayonets. But the Dutch kept coming, their square tight, their discipline unbroken even in catastrophe. They were not running to the sea. They were cutting their way out.

I was already riding when I saw it.

I had positioned my Maravar and Madurai horse on the left flank, hidden by a grove of palms. From there, I saw what Ramayyan might have missed in the smoke, the Dutch square had a seam.

They were focused on the infantry ahead. Their rear ranks watched the burning fort behind them. But their flank, the side facing the scrubland, had thinned as officers pulled men forward to reinforce the advance.

I did not wait for an order. I did not signal. I simply kicked my horse into motion, and my riders followed like water through a broken dam.

The last hundred yards stretched like hours. Through the haze I saw Dutch faces turning, eyes widening as they registered what was coming. A sergeant shouted something, tried to wheel his men. Too slow. Their muskets were still swinging toward us when we reached them, bayonets catching sunlight at angles that would never meet horse or rider.

We hit the Dutch square from the side.

The impact was terrible. Horses screaming, steel ringing, the wet crunch of bodies falling. The Dutch tried to turn, to reform, but a square that turns is no longer a square. It is a crowd.

I drove my horse toward the gap we had torn. Dhanaji was beside me, then ahead of me, his sword already bloody. The Deccan riders poured through, and suddenly we were among them, too close for their muskets, too fast for their bayonets.

The square collapsed.

It did not break cleanly. The Dutch fought in knots, in clusters, back to back. But the shape that had protected them was gone. Ramayyan's infantry pressed from the front. We circled and struck again from the rear. We were in the middle of it, cutting down the resistance one desperate pocket at a time.

And then, as suddenly as it had begun, it was over.

The survivors threw down their arms. Some knelt. Others simply stood, hollow-eyed, their hands raised, their blue coats stained with blood and ash.

As the sun began to set, painting the smoke-stained sky in lurid purples and reds, the fire finally burned itself down to glowing embers. The Dutch huddled on the beach, a broken remnant of the force that had landed with such arrogance. But they had not surrendered meekly. They had come out fighting, and it had taken our charge to end them.

Then, through the haze of smoke and fading light, a figure emerged from the Dutch lines.

He was tall, pale-haired, his blue coat torn and stained with soot. He walked toward us with his hands open at his sides, calling out in Portuguese. Behind him, I could see Rijtel and the other surviving officers, hollow-eyed, watching their comrade step forward to parley.

"I am Eustachius De Lannoy," the tall man said, his voice carrying across the sand. "Captain of the Dutch East India Company. I speak for the garrison."

Ramayyan stepped forward.

"You speak for men who burned our temples and took our people as slaves," he said. "Why should we listen?"

De Lannoy did not flinch.

"Because dead men cannot teach you how to build what we just lost," he said. "And I would rather build than rot."

It was the first time I heard those words from his own mouth. Later, I would learn what they meant. But in that moment, standing in the smoke of a ruined fort, they sounded like a man who had already decided which side of the wall he wanted to stand on.

I rode up to where Ramayyan stood.

He was not holding his leaf bundles today. The Diwan had led the infantry centre himself, as he had led it against Kollam and against the Desinganadu forces in the years leading up to this siege. His white dhoti was splattered with mud and soot. He was wiping a curved Nair sword with a piece of silk, the motion as precise as his calligraphy. Men who knew only his reputation for accounts and stylus forgot that he had planned the supply lines that kept our batteries fed, the grain routes that let us starve the Dutch while our own men ate. A general who cannot count is a butcher. Ramayyan could count, and he could kill.

“They are done,” I said.

“Yes,” he said softly, sliding the blade back into its sheath with a click. “They are done.” He looked at the king.

“Shall we finish them?” a captain asked.

Marthanda Varma looked at the miserable huddle on the sand, at the ships turning away in the deepening twilight.

“No,” he said. “Dead men cannot sign treaties. And they cannot teach us how to build what they just lost.”

He turned his horse away.

“Let them simmer tonight,” he said. “Let them taste the ash. Tomorrow, we will see what remains.”

The siege of Colachel had ended not with the thunderclap alone, but with our charge through the smoke. The explosion had wounded them. The cavalry had finished it.

But as I looked at the smoking ruin and the prisoners being led away, I knew the silence to come would be more dangerous than the noise. Now came the words. And words, in my experience, could be sharper than any sword.
