# Chapter 12: The Shadow from Arcot

Before the Dutch became the enemy we watched from our beaches, there was another shadow that fell across Travancore each dry season. It came not from the sea but from the northeast, from the passes where the ghats gave way to the Carnatic plains. It came with cavalry and cannon, with demands written in Persian and backed by Mughal seals that meant nothing in Delhi but everything to the men who carried them.

Chanda Sahib.

I had heard the name in Pune, spoken with the wary respect one gives to a competent rival. He was not Mughal by blood, but he had married into the Nawab of Arcot's family and climbed through the wreckage of the Carnatic wars until he held Madurai in his fist. From there, he looked south and saw what every ambitious man saw: pepper, ports, and a king who had not yet learned to bow.

"He came first in thirty-six," Ramayyan told me one evening, as we sat on the steps of a small temple watching the sun sink behind the palms. "Before you washed up on our shore. Before the king had finished breaking the Pillamar. We were weak, and Chanda Sahib knew it."

He picked up a small stone and turned it in his fingers.

"His cavalry came through Shenkottai (Shencotta) pass like water through a cracked dam. They burned villages. They took what they wanted. They sat on the edges of our kingdom and waited for the Maharaja to come with gold."

"And he came?"

"He had no choice." Ramayyan's voice carried no shame, only the flat pragmatism of a man who had counted the cost. "We paid. Tribute, they called it. Protection money is what it was. Fifty thousand rupees the first time. Then they came back the next year and asked for more."

I thought of the Maratha sardars I had known, the ones who rode into Mughal territory each dry season to collect chauth and sardeshmukhi. We called it our right. The Mughals called it extortion. The farmers caught in between called it survival.

"How many times?" I asked.

"Every year since," Ramayyan said. "Sometimes Chanda Sahib himself. Sometimes his generals. Sometimes just the threat of them, enough to keep us looking over our shoulder while we tried to build walls and train men. The Dutch watched all of it. They saw a king who had to buy his peace from one direction while they circled from another."

He threw the stone into the gathering dark.

"That is why we needed the English loans. That is why an English Company's money mattered more than its friendship. Every rupee we paid to Chanda Sahib was a rupee we could not spend on powder or walls."

He gestured toward the southeastern hills, where the last light was fading behind the ridgeline.

"But we did build walls," he said. "At Aramboli. At the passes. The Maharaja understood that tribute buys time, not safety. So while we paid Chanda Sahib with one hand, we scarred the land with the other. Ditches deep enough to break a horse's leg. Earthworks that turn a cavalry charge into a slaughter. Positions where a hundred men with muskets can hold against a thousand."

"I have seen them," I said. "From a distance."

"You will see them closer," Ramayyan said. "If Chanda Sahib ever comes again, or if someone worse follows him, those lines are where we make our stand. A king who builds walls sends a message: I am not here to be bullied. The Dutch saw those earthworks when Van Imhoff came sniffing. They knew then that we were not a chieftain's court to be pushed around with gifts and threats."

He smiled thinly.

"Walls cost less than tribute, in the long run. And they do not ride home when the rains come."

I learned more from the men who had fought in those earlier campaigns.

I rode against Chanda Sahib's cavalry in the skirmishes near Nagercoil, with Dhanaji at my shoulder. We spoke of it afterward with the frustrated respect of men who had faced a worthy enemy.

"Their horse were better than ours," he admitted. "Faster on open ground. They knew the passes, knew the water holes. We could not pin them down. Every time we moved to block one column, another appeared somewhere else."

"How did you survive?"

He shrugged. "We did not fight them in the open. We let the land fight for us. The ghats are not kind to cavalry that does not know them. Rivers flood. Paths become mud. Elephants cannot climb where goats can."

He gestured toward the distant hills.

"And we paid. When fighting cost more than tribute, the Maharaja opened his treasury. It is not glorious, but it kept the kingdom standing."

The tribute was not the only cost. Chanda Sahib had demanded Shenkottai, a strategic town on the southeastern frontier where the passes met the plains. It was a dagger pointed at Travancore's belly, and for years we had fought over it in small, ugly skirmishes that never quite became war.

"He wanted the pepper routes," Ramayyan explained. "Control Shenkottai, and you control what flows through the passes. He could have taxed every grain of pepper that moved to Madurai, to the Carnatic, to the ports the English and French were fighting over."

"And the Maharaja refused to give it up?"

"He gave it up, then took it back, then gave it up again." Ramayyan's smile was thin. "Shenkottai has changed hands more times than I can count. Each time, men died. Each time, we paid in gold and blood."

---

What I did not tell them was what I knew from my own people.

The Marathas had not been idle while Chanda Sahib played king in the south. The Peshwa's generals had watched him rise with the same calculation they applied to every power that grew too strong. A Nawab who controlled Madurai and reached for Travancore was a Nawab who might one day threaten Maratha interests in the Carnatic.

I had left Pune before the campaign began, but I had heard whispers even in my exile. Raghuji Bhonsle's men were moving south. The Nizam was distracted by his own troubles. And Chanda Sahib, for all his cavalry and his Persian letters, was overextended.

I said nothing of this to Ramayyan. I did not know how the war would end, and I had learned that speaking of Maratha strength in a foreign court could be dangerous. Men might think I was a spy, or worse, a lever they could use to bargain with powers I no longer served.

So I kept my silence and watched the horizon for news.

---

It came in the spring of 1741, just as the Dutch were tightening their grip on the coast.

A messenger arrived from the northeast, exhausted, his horse lathered and trembling. He had ridden through the night, through territory that was still contested, carrying a single ola sealed with wax.

Ramayyan read it in the war hall. His face did not change, but I saw his fingers tighten on the edges of the leaf.

"Chanda Sahib has fallen," he said.

The room went silent.

"Fallen?" Marthanda Varma leaned forward. "Dead?"

"Captured." Ramayyan handed the leaf to the king. "The Marathas took Tiruchirappalli (Trichinopoly). Chanda Sahib was inside. Raghuji Bhonsle's men have him in chains."

I felt the eyes in the room turn toward me, quick and curious. They knew where I came from. They knew what the orange flag meant.

Marthanda Varma read the leaf slowly, his lips moving slightly as he parsed the Tamil script. When he looked up, his expression was unreadable.

"The Peshwa's war has done what our tribute could not," he said. "Chanda Sahib will not ride south this season. Perhaps not ever."

"The Marathas will want payment for their service," one of the chiefs muttered. "They always do."

"Let them want," the king said. "They are far away. The Dutch are close. I will worry about debts when the creditors can reach my door."

He turned to me.

"You knew this was coming, Sawant?"

I chose my words carefully.

"I knew the Peshwa had interests in the Carnatic," I said. "I knew Raghuji Bhonsle was ambitious and that Chanda Sahib had made enemies. But I did not know when or how the blow would fall. I have been here, Maharaja, not in Pune. My knowledge is old."

He studied me for a long moment.

"Old knowledge is still knowledge," he said. "Tell me what happens now. What do the Marathas do with a captured Nawab?"

I thought of the ransoms I had seen negotiated in the Deccan, the endless bargaining over prisoners of rank.

"They will hold him," I said. "He is worth more alive than dead. His family will pay for his release, or the Nizam will pay, or whoever wants to use him as a piece in the next game. The Marathas are patient. They will extract every pagoda they can before they let him go."

"And while they extract?"

"While they extract, he cannot ride south. His generals will scatter. His army will dissolve. Men who followed him for glory will look for new masters. The pressure on your eastern frontier will ease."

Ramayyan nodded slowly.

"Then we have a window," he said. "The Marathas have given us a gift, whether they meant to or not. Chanda Sahib is caged. The Dutch do not know it yet."

"They will know soon enough," the king said. "Their spies are everywhere. But for now, we can turn our full attention to the sea."

He stood, his spear in his hand.

"Enough talk of Arcot. The Dutch are the enemy in front of us. Let the Marathas deal with the shadow at our back. We have our own war to win."

---

That night, I walked alone through the camp.

The news had spread. Men spoke in low voices about the Marathas, about Chanda Sahib, about what it meant for the kingdom. Some looked at me with new respect, as if my people's victory was somehow mine. Others looked at me with suspicion, wondering what other secrets I kept behind my Maratha face.

I found a quiet spot on a low rise overlooking the coast. The sea was dark, the Dutch ships invisible, but I could imagine them out there, waiting.

Chanda Sahib had been the shadow at our back for years. Every dry season, his cavalry had come through the passes, demanding tribute, testing our defenses, reminding us that we were not the only power with ambitions in the south. Now that shadow had been lifted by men I no longer served, men who would not even know my name if I returned to Pune.

The irony was not lost on me.

I had fled the Peshwa's justice. I had washed up on this foreign shore with nothing but the scars on my back and the skills in my hands. And now, without knowing it, the very power I had escaped had done more to secure Travancore's eastern frontier than all my drills and all my riding.

The world turns strangely. One man's capture becomes another man's freedom. One kingdom's loss becomes another kingdom's gain.

I thought of Chanda Sahib in his chains, somewhere in the Carnatic, bargaining for his life with men who counted his worth in gold. I thought of the Marathas, my people, planting their flags where the Mughals had once ruled. I thought of Marthanda Varma, freed now to face the Dutch without looking over his shoulder.

The sea wind carried the smell of salt and smoke.

Tomorrow, or the day after, the Dutch would make their move. They would land at Colachel with their blue coats and their cannon, thinking they faced a king still bleeding from two fronts.

They were wrong.

The shadow from Arcot had lifted. Now there was only the sea, and the enemy upon it, and the sand where we would meet them.

I turned back toward the camp. There was still work to do.
