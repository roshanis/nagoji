# Chapter 2: The Slave Ship South

They woke us under cover of bells. The great church above rang for early Mass, a flood of sound rolling down through stone into the cells. I counted the strokes. When the last echo faded, bolts scraped at the dungeon door.

João entered with three guards at his back.

“Up,” he shouted in rough Konkani, a version rounded by Portuguese tongues. “Those marked go to the docks.”

He moved down the line with a leather strip of symbols, tapping one man, skipping two, cuffing another awake, all the while humming a hymn under his breath. The tune was the same one the church bells had played.

When he reached me he did not bother to look at the marks on my cell wall. He knew where I sat. He had spent too many hours standing over me, hands busy with iron and rope.

“On your feet, marata,” he said. “The Viceroy has found a use for you.”

The guards unlocked the shackles at my ankles. For a brief moment the weight of the iron vanished and my legs swung free, terrifyingly light. I stood slowly, every joint complaining. The beatings and the wrenched limbs from the previous days had left my body bent and aching, but I forced myself not to limp.

Ahead, two places along the chain, Keshavrao shuffled in step, his familiar narrow shoulders stiff, his black hair hacked short in the Portuguese style. Even now his right hand twitched at his side, still reaching for a sword hilt that was no longer there.

They chained us in a line, six men to a length of iron, wrists manacled, collars clamped around our necks. The metal was slick from the sweat and grime of countless prisoners before us.

“Rao,” I said softly.

His head twitched, but he did not look back. A guard walked between us, club in hand.

The climb from the dungeon to the world of light was like being born through a tunnel of stone. At each turn the air grew a little fresher and the smell of filth retreated before new smells. Oil. Bread. Sea.

We emerged into a courtyard of whitewashed walls and glaring sky. The sudden brightness stabbed my eyes. Shapes resolved themselves slowly. Musketeers stood along the walls, hats tilted, matchcords coiled at their belts.

Father Duarte stood near the gate.

He was dressed for travel, a broad hat shading his grey eyes, a leather satchel over one shoulder. When our line of prisoners shuffled past, his gaze moved along the chain until it found me. For a moment our eyes met.

I expected triumph, or at least satisfaction. The stubborn Maratha, broken at last, being led to whatever slow death awaited in the southern plantations.

Instead, his jaw tightened. His hand rose, almost involuntarily, and made a small sign of the cross, not the hurried gesture of a man warding off contamination, but something slower, more deliberate. A blessing, perhaps. Or an apology.

He did not speak. He did not step forward. He simply watched as the guards pushed us toward the gate, and then he turned away, disappearing through a side door into the fortress.

I filed his face away in the part of my mind that kept accounts. Men who hesitate are men who can be used. Men who feel guilt carry weight that slows them down.

Someday, I thought, that hesitation might matter.

Beyond the far gate the sound of the sea thudded against the edge of hearing.

They moved us through narrow streets where the houses leaned inward like gossiping women, balconies almost touching above our heads. Goan Catholics in clean cotton stepped aside as we passed, hands over mouths and noses. A few Hindu merchants watched from their doorways, faces carefully blank. Their eyes told a different story. They measured us, weighed the value of the bodies in chains, and filed the calculations away in minds that already carried too much.

The smell of salt grew stronger. So did the stink of tar, fish and unwashed sailors.

When we reached the harbour the full weight of the Portuguese world pressed in. The masts of ships clustered against the sky like a forest of stripped trees. Ropes creaked, gulls screamed, and the heave of water against hulls set up a constant low groan that settled in the bones.

One ship loomed closer than the rest, her hull black and high, her stern built up like a little fortress of carved wood and painted saints. Men moved along her rails, hauling on lines, shouting in a mixture of tongues. On the wharf below her a platform had been erected, and on it a man in a broad-brimmed hat checked lists against the lines of chained prisoners.

“To Angola,” someone whispered behind me. “Africa.”

“Not this one,” said another voice, older and bitter. “The Jesuits need bodies for their lands to the south. Some place beyond Sri Lanka. They will work us until we forget our own names.”

João tugged at our chain. “Faster,” he grunted. “The tide waits for no man. Not even maratas.”

We were herded up a gangplank slick with sea and tar. The ship towered over us, the smell of old voyages clinging to her planks. As my bare feet touched the wood, the planks flexed under my weight, shifting subtly as the water lifted and dropped the hull. For a moment an old, absurd thought surfaced.

Horses would hate this.

On deck the air was full of movement. Sailors darted around us, some dark-skinned men from other parts of the empire, some pale Europeans whose faces burned red in the sun. Above, canvas cracked as it caught the breeze. The world of land, with its forts and fields and familiar dust, already felt far away.

They drove us below.

The hold had been prepared for us. Wooden shelves had been built along the sides, each shelf divided into little pens by upright planks. Someone had scratched prayers into the wood above my head, in a script I could not read. Another prisoner, another ship, another journey that ended somewhere in chains. We were pushed into these spaces, four or five men to a compartment, until the air was thick with bodies. Iron rings had been bolted into the beams overhead to take the chains that linked us.

Keshavrao and I ended in the same section by accident or indifference. When the guards moved on, rattling chains and cursing, he turned his head at last.

“Sahib,” he whispered.

I had never liked that word from him. In camp I had insisted he use my name. We were both sons of the Deccan; the distance between us was one of experience, not blood. Now, though, in that cramped, stinking space, there was comfort in the old military habit.

“Rao,” I said. “You are still alive.”

He gave a small, breathless laugh that turned into a cough. “For now.”

We spoke little at first. The hold filled with the noises of settling misery. Chains scraped. Men shifted to ease cramps that could not truly be eased. Someone at the far end of the deck began to chant a hymn in a coastal tongue close to my own, voice rising and falling as if it belonged to the creaking of the hull.

Through a hatch far above, a square of light showed strips of sky. A gull crossed that square, a white streak against blue, and the ship began to move.

“Do you know where they send us?” Keshavrao asked after a while.

“South,” I said. “That much is certain.”

“I heard one of the guards say they need men to cut cane,” he muttered. “Fields of sugar, as tall as a man. Sun that burns the skin off your back. The priest promised them that work in distant lands counts the same as service to their God. We will sweat for their salvation.”

In camp he had been the one who joked, who found some rough song to carry us through long marches. The dungeon had scraped that away. I remembered him riding bareheaded near Chaul, singing over the crack of muskets, daring the Portuguese to shoot the song out of his mouth.

“We are not there yet,” I said. “As long as we move, there is a chance.”

He shifted his weight, chains clinking. “The sahib still counts chances.”

“It is what I know.”

Time on a ship is different from time on land. In a fort you can measure days by the sun on the walls, by the calls of guards on the ramparts, by the rhythm of work and rest. In the dark belly of a vessel there is only the change in the pitch of the hull, the moments when hatches open for food and air, and the slow erosion of the sense that the world is anything more than wood, iron and salt.

They brought us rice and dried fish twice a day. The water was stale and tasted of wood and old journeys. Men fell sick quickly in the close, damp air. Coughs turned wet. Wounds from the dungeon festered. The little space that each of us had claimed narrowed as the weaker sagged against the stronger.

Sometimes, when the hatches stayed open a little longer, Portuguese voices drifted down from above.

“Wind is with us,” one man said once. “If it holds we round the cape before the worst of the storms.”

“If the storms do not find us anyway,” another replied. “This run is cursed. The last ship took lightning in the mast. They say God sends warnings.”

“God sends opportunity,” a third voice cut in, amused. “These bodies in the hold are silver if they live to touch the soil we have claimed.” He named a number of cruzados per head, as if we were sacks of pepper. “Pray for their health, not their souls.”

Their laughter filtered down with the light.

Below deck Keshavrao shivered.

“If there is a storm,” he said, voice low, “will the ship break?”

“All ships break,” I said. “The question is when and how.”

He was silent for a time. Then, very quietly, he said, “If the chains break too, I will follow wherever you jump, sahib.”

The words settled over me heavier than iron.

I had never meant to collect followers. On the dusty roads and river crossings near Nashik I had led men because someone had to ride in front, to show that Portuguese guns could be faced even away from their forts. Those who followed did so because they trusted my calculations, not because they saw anything in me worth adoring. Now, in a dark hold that smelled of vomit and fear, one boy's loyalty wrapped itself like a rope around my chest.

I reached across the narrow gap between us and rested my bandaged hand on his forearm.

“If there is a chance,” I said, “I will not leave you.”

His fingers closed briefly over my bandaged hand. Neither of us mentioned that promises made in chains are the easiest to break.

Above, the timbers creaked in a new rhythm. The ship rolled more sharply, the water slapping her sides with a sound that had teeth. Somewhere, a sailor cursed. Somewhere else, a prayer rose.

The Arabian Sea was beginning to remind us who owned this ship.
