# Chapter 11: Dutch on the Horizon

It was late in 1739 when the horizon finally changed, ending the years of quiet consolidation. This was not yet the war fleet that would come two years later, only a probing squadron, sent to measure distances and count our guns. But we did not know that then.

The Dutch had been on this coast long enough to learn our tides and our quarrels. They had taken Kochi from the Portuguese in 1663, nearly eighty years before, and in all that time they had never stopped meddling. They played raja against raja, backed one claimant, then abandoned him for another, signed treaties in thick ink and broke them in thin whispers. Their presence in Malabar had been driven by two hungers that never sat comfortably together. They wanted pepper at a price that pleased their faraway masters, and they wanted a way to reach the pepper hills beyond their coastal forts without bleeding coin on an expensive inland war. That restlessness made them smile in our halls and sharpen knives in our shadows.

We had not been idle. The army Ramayyan built had stretched its legs, marching north to swallow Kollam (Quilon) and break the lines of Desinganadu. It was a short, sharp campaign, a test of the new muskets and the discipline of the Nairs we had drilled in the wet sand. We won, and the Raja of Desinganadu fled, leaving his rich pepper fields in Marthanda Varma's grip. But in swallowing the small fish, we had drawn the eye of the shark.

---

The first time I saw Dutch sails close enough to count, I was standing beneath a boy on a watch tower.

He was perhaps fifteen, lanky in the way youths are when their bones grow faster than their muscles. He stood on a wooden platform lashed to the top of a coconut palm on a headland, a long glass tube held to his eye. The sea wind tugged at his hair and his threadbare cloth.

"Three ships," he called in Malayalam as I rode up the sandy path under the midday sun. "No, four. The new one is smaller. They fly the same colours."

The guard at the base of the tree looked up.

"The banded flag?" he shouted.

"Yes," the boy said. "Red, white, blue."

The guard turned to me.

"Company ships," he said in Hindustani. "Dutch."

We were on a finger of land that jutted out into the sea, one of several such points along the coast where Marakkars and Nair guardians had built rough lookouts. From here, on a clear day, you could watch ships move along the horizon like beads on a string.

Today, the string was busier than usual.

I shaded my eyes and squinted out to sea. At first, all I saw were tiny specks of white against the blue. Slowly, my Deccan eyes, more accustomed to reading slopes and dust trails, began to make sense of the new shapes.

Four hulls, three large, one smaller, sails full, moving in slow procession along the line where sky met water.

"They are closer than yesterday," the boy called.

"You have seen them before?" I asked.

He grinned down at me.

"They come and go," he said. "Sometimes they sit like lazy crocodiles for days. Sometimes they hurry past as if chased by gods. These ones move like men who know where they are going."

"And who leads them?" I asked.

The boy lowered the glass for a moment and wiped his sweating palm on his cloth.

"The same tall captain," he said. "The one with the pale hair and the stick he uses to beat his men into straight lines."

The guard at the base snorted.

"He means the Dutch officer," he said. "The one their traders whisper about. The one who drills them until they piss in step."

"He stands on the quarterdeck, always in the same place," the boy went on. "Hands behind his back. When he turns, the men move. When he scratches his nose, they move slower."

There was admiration in his voice, grudging but genuine. Even enemy discipline has its own pull for young eyes.

"Keep watching," I said. "Count how many days they hover. Count how close they dare come. The sea tells us things if we listen."

As we rode back toward the coastal hall, Ibrahim shook his head.

"They smell blood," he said. "Or pepper. To them it is the same."

"They smell a king who does not kneel easily," I said.

"That too," he agreed.

---

In the war hall, the air was thick with the smell of ink and sweat.

Maps lay unrolled across the floor, held down by stones and spear shafts. Pebbles and shells marked ships, forts, hills, villages. Ramayyan crouched over one of these maps, his thin fingers moving tokens with the care of a priest placing offerings.

Marthanda Varma sat nearby, not on his platform but on the floor itself, cross-legged, spear laid aside. His hair was bound back with a simple cloth. His upper body glistened with a sheen of heat; he had clearly been there for some time.

"Sawant," he said without looking up as I entered. "Tell me."

I crossed the room and knelt at the edge of the map.

"Four company ships," I said. "Three large, one smaller. Flying Dutch colours. Moving south along the line. The watch boy says the same tall officer stands on the quarterdeck. Pale hair, stiff back. He drills them hard."

Ramayyan's hand hovered above a small shell.

"Here," he said, placing it off a headland he had marked with a charcoal smear. "If they hold that course and that speed."

"They will anchor within sight of our coast by evening," Ibrahim added, stepping forward. "Close enough to send boats ashore if they wish. Not close enough to risk your cannon, Maharaja."

"They test us," Marthanda Varma said. "They want to see how high we raise our hackles when they show their teeth."

He looked up at me.

"What would your Peshwa do?" he asked. "If four foreign ships hovered off his coast like vultures?"

In that moment Pune's court rose before me, painted pillars and high seat, the scribes and sardars, the priests and petitioners. I imagined the news carried north, the murmurs, the measured outrage.

"He would send letters," I said. "To his sardars, to the companies, to Delhi. He would demand explanations. He would threaten, but he would not move his own men until he had counted the cost twice. His coast is not as tightly bound to his capital as yours is. He can afford to pretend distance."

"I cannot," Marthanda Varma said. "If the Dutch piss in our waters, the smell reaches my throne the same day."

Ramayyan's stylus scratched on a palm leaf.

"We know from our informants," he said, "that these ships answer to the Zeeland chamber of the company. Their commander has been cautioned not to provoke open war, but has been told to remind local chiefs who controls trade. He will look for our weak points. He will test alliances."

"He will land if he thinks he can do so without losing too many shoes," Ibrahim said. "Boats to small ports. Gifts for those who fear you more than the company. Promises written in thick ink and broken in thin whispers."

"What do they make of our sand drills?" I asked. "Of our horse and muskets?"

"They know some of it," Ramayyan said. "Their merchants watch. Their petty captains talk. But they have not yet seen what you did on that shore when no one counted but the boy on the palm and the king under the awning."

Marthanda Varma tapped the map with his finger.

"I want them to glimpse enough to worry," he said. "Not enough to understand."

He looked at me, and something shifted in his expression.

"I have not forgotten what you did in February," he said.

---

I had been summoned to that meeting eight months before, the meeting with Van Imhoff himself.

The Dutch Governor of Sri Lanka (Ceylon) had sailed to this coast with three hundred men and a list of demands. He had met Marthanda Varma at Tengapattanam, arriving with gifts worth thousands of rupees and leaving with nothing but insults.

I had stood behind the king that night, dressed in Maratha fashion, my talwar visible, my scars on display. Beside me stood Dhanaji and four other Deccan riders, all of us positioned as if we were merely guards. We were not guards. We were theatre.

"Let them see Marathas at your shoulder," Ramayyan had whispered to the king before the meeting. "Let Van Imhoff wonder whether the Peshwa's men ride south for pepper or for alliance. A question he cannot answer is worth more than a hundred soldiers he can count."

Van Imhoff had arrived at half past eleven, the Malabar women ululating in welcome as the king's procession approached. The Dutch trumpets and drums answered our music. It was all very civil. It was all very careful. Each side counting the other's men, their weapons, their bearing.

Van Imhoff was not a fool. He had governed Sri Lanka. He knew how to read a local court. His eyes had lingered on my face, on the way I stood, on the Marathi I muttered to Dhanaji when the interpreter paused. He had no way of knowing I was a fugitive with no letter from Pune, no Peshwa's blessing, no army behind me. All he saw was what we wanted him to see: a southern king with Deccan steel at his back.

The meeting had ended badly. Van Imhoff had demanded pepper contracts and trading posts at Colachel and Vizhinjam. Marthanda Varma had countered with requests for Dutch support against Chanda Sahib, who was pushing from the south with Madurai's armies. Neither man gave ground.

Then came the gold.

"One thousand kalanjus," the king had said. "For the hiranyagarbha ceremony. A gesture of friendship from the Company."

The hiranyagarbha. The ritual that would make him twice-born, give him authority over the temples, and entitle him to be crowned Kulasekhara Perumal, sovereign of all Kerala.

Van Imhoff had smiled and offered eight.

Eight kalanjus. Less than one percent of what the ceremony required. It was not a negotiation. It was a calculated insult, a message that the Dutch did not want Marthanda Varma to complete the hiranyagarbha. They did not want him to become Kulasekhara Perumal, because a king with that title could claim authority over the entire Malabar coast, including territories where Dutch allies held power.

The Kochi Raja did not want it. The Desinganadu chief did not want it. The Dutch did not want it.

They measured out their contempt in gold and called it diplomacy.

Marthanda Varma had smiled and said nothing. But I had seen his jaw tighten. I had seen Ramayyan's stylus pause over his leaf. The insult had been noted. It would be answered.

Even before that insult, Varma had been thinking like a man building a state, not merely taking territory. On the southeastern frontier, where Madurai riders came down in the dry season, he had already scarred the land with earthworks and ditches at Aramboli. The Dutch saw that too. A king who builds walls is harder to bargain with than a king who only begs for guns.

---

Now, eight months later, the answer was taking shape.

"You will take a small party of riders along the coast," he said. "Move in sight of their ships, but out of cannon range. Let their glass see horse that do not fear the water's edge. Let them see dust where they expect to see only fishermen."

"They will think we mean to charge the sea," I said.

"Let them think many things," he said. "Confusion is a useful ally. We will not fire first. We will not give them cause to say to Batavia and Amsterdam that the savage Travancore king attacked peaceful traders. But we will not lower our heads either."

Ramayyan added softly, "And while you ride, our men on the backwaters will count how many boats the Dutch send toward which creeks. Our scribes in the markets will listen to which chiefs receive Dutch cloth and coins. Our temple men will note which sleeves carry new gold."

The plan, such as it was, spread like ripples from a stone.

---

The Dutch came to court three days later.

Not the same men from the ships. Envoys. Negotiators. Men with account books and careful smiles.

Court in Travancore did not look like court in Pune. There was no raised throne with a carved canopy, no line of sardars in embroidered coats jostling for the place closest to the royal ear. Instead, the king sat on a low platform in a long hall open on one side to the breeze. Mats covered the floor. Men and women sat in clusters rather than neat ranks, their positions telling you as much as their clothes.

From my place near one of the wooden pillars, I could see almost everything.

On the king's right sat Ramayyan, leaf bundles stacked neatly before him, stylus resting lightly in his hand. His eyes moved constantly. He seemed to be listening to three conversations at once, some spoken aloud, some in glances.

On the king's left, a space had been cleared.

That was where the Dutch would sit.

They entered with the heavy formality of men who had been told to be polite to people they considered their inferiors.

Two of them wore coats of dark cloth, cut tight at the waist, with rows of brass buttons that gleamed in the lamplight. Lace showed at their cuffs. Their hair was tied back, some grey streaks showing at the temples. Behind them walked younger men with account books and a single interpreter, a man of mixed features whose eyes slid everywhere and settled nowhere.

They carried hats under their arms, respectfully bareheaded within the hall.

"Maharaja," the older of the two said in Portuguese, bowing slightly. The interpreter turned the words into Malayalam with smooth precision. "The Honourable Company brings greetings and hopes for continued friendship."

Marthanda Varma inclined his head. He wore no crown, only a simple cloth over his shoulder and a string of rudraksha beads at his neck.

"You bring ships that sit like crows on our water," he said. "Is that how your company shows friendship?"

The interpreter blinked, taken aback by the directness. He recovered and translated. The Dutch envoy's mouth tightened very slightly.

"Our ships patrol the coast to protect trade," he said. "There are pirates. There are rival companies. The seas are not as peaceful as we would like."

"Nor is the land," the king said. "Yet you do not see my horse standing in your streets in Batavia."

There was a ripple in the hall. A few local chiefs smiled behind their hands. Padmini Amma, seated not far from the front, her stick across her knees, allowed the barest hint of amusement to show in her eyes.

The king's gaze flicked to her, and for a heartbeat something unguarded passed between them, then vanished back into politics.

Revathi Bayi sat farther back, surrounded by older women from Velinadu and a few younger relatives. She wore a deep green sari this time, her jewellery more subdued than at our first meeting. Her gaze, however, remained as sharp as a drawn blade.

The Dutch envoy spread his hands.

"We regret if our presence has caused concern," he said. "Our intention is only to ensure that the pepper and other goods we pay for reach our ships unmolested. We also wish to reaffirm our treaties with the important houses of this coast."

His eyes flicked toward the cluster of Velinadu women, then to Padmini Amma. He knew enough to know where land lay.

The Dutch and the Portuguese before them had learned early that it is cheaper to keep a royal house quarrelling than to garrison every village. If no single branch grows strong enough to close the pepper groves to them, the company can make a treaty with whichever cousin is hungry this season, buy the spice for less than it is worth, and sail away without leaving too many bones on our soil.

Ramayyan's stylus moved, marking that glance.

"Our treaties stand," Revathi Bayi said suddenly, in clear Portuguese that needed no interpreter. The room shifted its attention to her as easily as if someone had moved a lamp. "They say that the company respects Velinadu's rights and that Velinadu respects the company's trade. They say nothing of the company telling my kin in Travancore how many muskets to buy or whom to marry."

The Dutch envoy looked faintly surprised to be addressed directly by a woman. His eyes widened a fraction more when he realised she spoke his language.

"Princess," he said, inclining his head more deeply than he had for some of the chiefs. "We know the history of your line. We come with renewed respect."

"Respect is shown in actions, not words," she replied. "Last time your company men came to Velinadu with arrogance, many of them fed the earth. We have not forgotten. I doubt their widows have either."

One of the younger Dutchmen shifted uncomfortably.

"The events you mention were unfortunate," the envoy said. "They belonged to another time, another management."

"Our memories do not change when your clerk's handwriting does," she said.

Marthanda Varma let the exchange breathe for a moment, then lifted his hand.

"We are not here to relive old mistakes," he said. "We are here to see whether new ones can be avoided."

He gestured, and the hall's attention turned toward a group of men seated a little way off.

Local chiefs, each wearing their pride in different shapes. One had his hair tied back with a carved wooden stick, a sign of some minor title. Another wore layers of gold chains that looked more like debt than wealth. A third sat very straight, his clothes plain, his hands unadorned, the mark of someone who trusted his own land more than ornaments.

"You have lands that lie between my forts and the company's warehouses," the king said to them. "You send pepper and men to both of us. You owe tax to my throne and promises to Velinadu and oaths to the Dutch. That is a great many directions for your heads to bow."

There was nervous laughter.

"The Maharaja speaks truth," one chief said, choosing boldness. "We are pulled like rope in a tug of war. We wish only that the rope not break."

"Rope breaks when it is worn or rotten," Ramayyan said softly. "We are trying to strengthen it. The question is whether you prefer to be tied to a king who lives among you or to a company whose masters sit beyond the sea."

The Dutch envoy's face remained carefully neutral, but his interpreter swallowed.

I watched the chiefs' eyes. Some darted toward the Dutch, some toward the king, some toward the floor. One man's gaze flicked, just once, toward Ibrahim in the back of the hall. Ramayyan's stylus noted that too.

"The company brings guns and coins," one of the chiefs said. "They pay fair weight for pepper, twelve varahans the candi, in good gold pagodas."

"Fair weight," Padmini murmured. "And then they sell that pepper at three times the price elsewhere. Ask them what is fair."

The chief in plain clothes, the one who trusted his land more than ornaments, shifted slightly. "What of Kottarakkara?" he asked. "The Elayadathu chief still receives Dutch Factors. His sister's daughter writes to Velinadu. There are whispers."

The name dropped into the hall like a stone into still water.

I watched the ripples.

Marthanda Varma's jaw tightened, a small movement, quickly controlled. Ramayyan's stylus stopped mid-stroke. Padmini's fingers curled around her stick until her knuckles paled. And Revathi, beside her, went utterly still, her face a mask that told me nothing and everything.

No one spoke for three heartbeats.

"Kottarakkara," the king said finally, his voice carefully even, "will be addressed in its time. We are not here to discuss houses that have not yet learned to count."

The plain-clothed chief lowered his eyes. He had asked a question he already knew the answer to. He had wanted to see who flinched.

I filed the name away. Kottarakkara. Elayadathu. Revathi's stillness. The king's jaw. Something lived in those syllables that I did not yet understand.

Only later, when company cannon fired beside Kochi and Desinganadu men and Dutch coin flowed into the hands of exiled princes, did I understand what that question had really been. Kottarakkara was not just a stubborn house. It was a lever. The Dutch had no love for any collateral branch of Travancore. They loved only the advantage of a divided court, where promises could be bought cheap and pepper could be signed away under one cousin's seal while another cousin sharpened his knives.

"We do not deny the company's role in trade," Marthanda Varma said. "But let no one here be confused. This land is not theirs. The roads are not theirs. The fields are not theirs. The men who die when guns fire are not theirs."

He turned back to the Dutch envoy.

"You wish to reaffirm treaties," he said. "Let us speak plainly. You will have your pepper. You will pay for it. You will not build new forts on this coast without my consent. You will not arm my enemies. In return, you will find your ships supplied, your merchants safe from bandits who think Europeans make sound targets."

"And if we refuse?" the envoy asked.

Silence fell. Even the breeze seemed to pause at the edge of the hall.

Ramayyan's gaze slid to me for a fraction of a heartbeat, then back to the map of faces.

"Then you test our patience," Marthanda Varma said. "And our sand."

The words were simple. The weight behind them was not.

I thought of the drills on the shore, of horses learning to move in wet sand, of matchlocks cracking over the surf. I thought of the boy in the palm top lookout, counting Dutch hulls.

The envoy must have thought of those things too, or of reports that had reached him. His jaw shifted. Some calculation moved behind his eyes.

"We will convey your words to our superiors," he said. "In the meantime, we propose a written agreement, signed by you, the Velinadu house, and the leading landholders, so that all parties understand their obligations."

Revathi lifted her chin.

"We will read every line," she said. "Twice."

"And we will draft some of our own," Ramayyan added. "Our scribes are not as slow as you may think."

---

The rest of the afternoon passed in the rhythms of negotiation.

Words like "mutual defence" and "exclusive rights" and "tariffs" floated in the air, in Portuguese, in Malayalam, in Tamil the interpreter shifted to when he needed to make sense to more ears. Ramayyan guided the flow like a patient river pilot, steering around rocks, nudging here, redirecting there.

I listened, and I watched.

Watched which chiefs spoke and which stayed silent. Watched when Padmini's fingers tapped her stick and when they curled tight around it. Watched when Revathi's nostrils flared at a phrase. Watched the way the Dutch envoy's younger assistants whispered into his ear when some term troubled them.

At one point, during a break in the talk, Revathi moved along the edge of the crowd until she stood near me.

"You have been very quiet, Sawant," she said in Konkani. "Does all this talk bore a man who prefers the noise of hooves?"

"On the contrary," I said. "I am learning how many ways there are to start wars without lifting a sword."

She gave a short, pleased hum.

"Good," she said. "If you are to serve here, you must learn to hear when a word carries the weight of a musket. Otherwise you will charge at the wrong time."

Her gaze swept the hall.

"See that man," she said, tilting her head toward one of the plainer dressed chiefs. "Two years ago he took Dutch coin to rebuild his flooded fields, a hundi drawn on the Kochi factory, payable in pepper at harvest. Today he speaks loudly about loyalty to the Maharaja. He is not lying. He has simply forgotten that the company expects their coin back with interest. When they come to collect, I wonder whose banner he will stand under."

"And you?" I asked. "Under whose banner will you stand when the king and the company pull in different directions?"

She looked at me as if I had asked whether the sea preferred high or low tide.

"I stand under Velinadu's," she said. "The others move around us and hope we do not notice when they step on our toes."

---

After the Dutch withdrew, the light slanted low. They bowed, promised to return with draft papers, and left behind a faint trail of foreign scent, a mixture of spice and sweat and some sharp alcohol.

As they walked out, their interpreter, a Portuguese factor, glanced at me, quick and curious. To him I was a foreigner in this hall, yet not European. A man in simple cotton, with scars on his hands, listening more than he spoke. A piece on the board whose shape he had not yet accounted for.

Good.

Let them wonder.

Ramayyan beckoned me.

"Come," he said. "There is someone you should meet who knows the Dutch from inside their own walls."

He led me out of the main hall, down a side passage that smelled of limewash and oil, into a smaller room open on one side to a narrow courtyard. A single man sat there on a low stool, a clay cup of water untouched at his feet.

He was pale, even under the southern sun, with a yellowish cast that spoke of long illness. His hair, cropped short, was threaded with grey, though he could not have been much older than me. A rough cotton shirt and dhoti hung awkwardly on a frame that still seemed to remember the cut of a uniform.

"This is Karl August," Ramayyan said in Malayalam, speaking slowly so I would understand. "He once wore the company's blue coat. Now he wears ours, when he wears anything at all."

The man rose, stiff with old pains, and inclined his head.

"I fought for the Dutch," he said in halting Portuguese, the words thick with a guttural accent. "They did not pay. They did not feed. They left us to rot in mud and fever. I decided I preferred to rot on my own terms."

Ramayyan spread a fresh palm leaf on the floor between us. Karl August knelt and began to draw with a stick of charcoal.

"Here," he said, sketching a curve that I recognised as the line of the coast. "Colachel. Sand. Here, mud fort, half fallen already under the weight of your enemy's guns." He marked a small square and shaded one corner. "Powder. Rice. Too close. They keep them together in their little church, because stone keeps damp out better than canvas."

He drew a second mark offshore.

"Here, Kanyakumari camp," he said. "Men sick. Smallpox. No pay. They hate their officers more than you do."

Ramayyan watched the shapes with the calm of a man fitting new pieces into a puzzle he already almost understood.

"We will not win this war with bravery alone," he said quietly. "We will win it with men who know where the enemy keeps his fire and his food."

---

That evening, as the sky turned copper, I rode along the ridge above the beach.

The ships had moved closer, as predicted. Their hulls were now clear, dark against the pale water. I could see gunports like blind eyes along their sides, open, closed, open. Through Ibrahim's glass, passed briefly to me, I glimpsed tiny figures pacing decks, adjusting ropes, staring back.

On the quarterdeck of the largest ship, a man stood.

Even at this distance, his posture was distinct. Hands clasped behind his back. Feet planted apart, adjusting minutely with the roll of the ship. A hat shaded his face, but I could see the pale of his hair where it escaped.

The boy on the watch tower had not exaggerated. There was a kind of contained severity in the man's stance, the same quality I had seen in Deccan officers who lived for drill and order.

I lowered the glass, then raised it again, as if the second look might show me something the first had missed.

"He is just a man," Ibrahim said quietly. "He will bleed like any other if you cut him."

"I know," I said. "But until I see him on land, it is hard not to think of him as part of the ship."

"Then imagine him drowning," Ibrahim said dryly. "That will help."

We walked our horses along the ridge, taking care to keep our silhouettes visible. Below, on the beach, a handful of Maravar riders trotted their mounts through the shallows, water splashing around their horses' legs. Farther inland, carts moved along the track with deliberate slowness, making it clear that life on this coast did not halt because European hulls hovered.

On the ship, tiny glass circles glinted in the last light as Dutch eyes watched us.

"The tall one will note that your riders do not panic when the waves reach their hooves," Ibrahim said. "He will tell his superiors that you train horse for this coast. They will mark it in their letters. Somewhere, a man with a powdered wig will tap that line and frown."

"Good," I said. "Let his wig itch."

Ibrahim handed back his glass with a small, unreadable smile.

"I should ride ahead," he said. "There are men in Kollam who will want to know the Dutch squadron has moved closer. Merchants who have contracts with both sides."

"Both sides?" I asked.

He shrugged, the gesture carrying generations of coastal pragmatism.

"A Marakkar who sells only to one master starves when that master sails away," he said. "My cousins trade with the company factories. My uncles trade with the Zamorin's ports. My father, God rest him, once sold the same pepper to Dutch and Portuguese buyers in the same week, each thinking they had an exclusive arrangement."

"And you?" I asked. "Who do you sell to?"

His eyes met mine, and for a moment I saw something beneath the easy merchant's charm: a calculation as cold as any I had seen in Ramayyan's gaze.

"I sell to whoever keeps this coast free enough for men like me to keep selling," he said. "Today, that is your king. Tomorrow?" He spread his hands. "The sea does not care about flags. Neither do I."

He kicked his horse into motion before I could respond, leaving me to wonder whether I had just heard an oath of loyalty or a warning.

---

When the sun dipped, I sat with Ramayyan as the chiefs drifted away.

"The Dutch left angry today," he said, adding a last few lines to his palm leaves. "They know the King is shifting the peppercorn trade away from them."

"Shifting it where?" I asked.

"To the Syrian Christians," he said, gesturing vaguely toward the north where Mathoo Tharakan's people held sway. "Tharakan and his kin. The King trusts them. They are of this soil, even if their god came from across the water. They build the warehouses, they move the grain, they keep the coin within the kingdom."

"And the other chiefs?"

"They grumble," Ramayyan said. "Houses like Elayadathu prefer the Portuguese or the Dutch. They think white skin means heavier gold. They do not see that the foreign hand takes two coins for every one it gives."

I frowned. "Why does the King not give the trade to his own kind? Why must it be Christians or foreigners? Are there no Hindu merchants?"

Ramayyan smiled, a dry, thin curving of his lips. "You are from the Deccan, Sawant. You forget our laws here. For a Hindu of good caste to cross the black water is to lose his caste. The ocean is kalapani, forbidden water. We can farm the pepper, we can tax the pepper, but we cannot sail with it to the markets of Arabia or Rome. That sin, we leave to others. Thankfully, their men are equally brave. We find them useful behind muskets or cannons."

He tapped his stylus against the leaf. "So we use the hands that are free to move. The Syrians. The Muslims. The King binds them to him so that when the ships sail, the profit returns to Padmanabhapuram, not Lisbon or Amsterdam."

"And the English?" I asked. "They sit at Anchuthengu and watch the same sea."

Ramayyan's mouth twitched.

"They are not saints," he said. "They lent us guns and silver when Chanda Sahib pushed from the south, not out of love for Travancore, but because they did not wish to see their factory swallowed by Madurai men."

He picked up another leaf, its edge already dark with handling.

"A Company doctor there put his own coin on the line," he went on. "He advanced money so that the Maharaja could meet part of what Chanda Sahib demanded and keep his army moving. The English call it a loan. We call it buying time."

"You trust him?" I asked.

"I trust his fear," Ramayyan said. "He knows that if this kingdom falls, the next army that marches along this coast will not stop at Anchuthengu to ask about interest."

---

Later, long after the horses were stabled and the riders dismissed, I climbed the bluff alone.

The boy with the spyglass had gone. The watch was held by an older man who nodded and went back to his quiet pacing. I walked to the edge where scrub gave way to rock and sat, knees drawn up, arms resting on them.

In the darkness, the sea erased distances. The ships were now only clusters of lights, their masts invisible. They could have been fishing boats, or floating shrines, or ghosts.

I listened to the hiss of waves on the sand below, the occasional creak of branch, the distant boom of surf against some unseen rock.

Somewhere out there, on that largest hull, the pale-haired officer stood or slept or paced. He had his own maps, his own Ramayyan whispering advice, his own king in a far city expecting profit and control. I did not yet know his name. That would come later, when he surrendered at Colachel and chose a different flag.

We had not yet met. Our swords had not yet crossed. Our names were sounds on other men's tongues.

Yet already I could feel him in the shape of the air, in the tension of the men in the hall, in the way Marthanda Varma's fingers had tapped the map when he spoke of him.

In Goa, my enemies had been men I could see across a dungeon table, smell across a torture room. Here, some of the most dangerous ones hovered beyond sight, their decisions carried by water and sealed with wax hundreds of leagues away.

I pressed my palm against the rough rock beside me, feeling its solidity.

"Come closer," I murmured to the lights offshore. "Come stand where I can reach you. Let us see how your neat lines fare when the ground shifts under you."

The sea gave no answer. It rarely does.

But as I sat there, the breeze shifted slightly, bringing with it the faintest trace of unfamiliar smoke. Not coconut husk, not jackfruit wood, not the resin of local trees.

Ship smoke.

Dutch smoke.

Threads had been woven in that hall. Some would hold. Some would snap. Either way, the fabric of this coast had been pulled a little tighter.

The horizon had begun to move nearer, whether it wished to or not.
