# Chapter 7: Horses in Wet Sand

The first time I tried to make Madurai horses run in Malabar sand, they laughed at me.

Not with their mouths. Horses do not waste breath on that. They laughed with every sideways step, every planted hoof that refused to drive, every rolling eye that said what the riders did not dare speak aloud.

You do not belong here, Deccan man.

The strip of beach the king had given me was narrow, caught between the rise of a low bluff and the tug of the Arabian Sea. At high tide the waves gnawed at it until only a sliver remained. At low tide it opened into a broader, packed plain of damp sand that looked inviting to a cavalryman who had never tried to stop a charge on such footing.

The sun had only just cleared the line of palms when the Madurai troop arrived, lances gleaming, turbans wrapped high. Their commander, a lean man with a hawk nose and a scar that puckered his left cheek, saluted with his spear butt to his chest.

“Raza Khan, at your service,” he said in a Hindustani that carried the singsong of the Carnatic. “The Nayak of Madurai sends his horse as promised. We have fought for Madurai and for your king before.”

Behind him the men sat straight in their saddles, horses tossing their heads, bits clinking. They looked confident. Too confident.

On the bluff above, a line of Maravar horsemen watched, their lighter mounts shifting impatiently. They wore no uniforms, only white mundus hitched for riding and short jackets, but each man carried himself with the easy assurance of one whose family had held swords for generations. Their commander, a broad-shouldered fellow named Ponnam Pandya Deven, had already ridden with me along the inland tracks. He said little, but his eyes missed nothing.

Closer to the bluff, under the shade of a cloth awning, two figures sat on low stools. Distance and the haze rising off the warming sand made them look small, but I knew them. Marthanda Varma, bare headed, a simple cloth over his shoulder. Ramayyan beside him, palm leaves in his lap, stylus ready, as if he meant to take notes on horses as much as on men.

The king had told me, in that coastal hall, to show him something he had not already imagined.

At the time, with the memory of chains still raw on my skin, the challenge had felt almost like grace. Now, faced with wet sand and two sets of riders who trusted their own ways more than mine, it sat on me like a weight.

“We begin with the simple release,” I said to Raza Khan and Ponnam Pandya Deven. “Ride to the water’s edge. Turn. Ride back. Do not let the hoof slide.”

Raza Khan frowned, his hand resting on his pommel.

“We did not ride from Madurai to school our mounts like children on their first pony,” he said. “My men ride to break lines, not to dance with crabs.”

“Your men ride on hard earth,” I said. “Here the ground lies to you. It looks firm, but it drinks the hoof. If you charge a Dutch square and your horse stumbles on the turn, you are not a soldier, you are a target.”

The Madurai rider’s jaw tightened. He glanced up at the bluff, where the King watched. He did not want to be seen arguing with the stranger Marthanda Varma had set over him.

“One pass,” he said. “To show you there is no magic in sand.”

Ponnan said nothing, but a faint smile touched his lips as he signalled his Maravar.

The first pass was a disaster.

I watched the Madurai horses hit the wetter sand. They were heavy beasts, bred for the dry country around Madurai. When they tried to turn, their weight carried them deep. Hooves sucked into the slurry. Legs flailed. Riders jerked reins to keep their seats, breaking the proud rhythm of the charge.

The Maravar fared slightly better. Their ponies were smaller, stepping lightly where the larger horses sank. They spun and darted, grinning at the southerners’ clumsiness.

“See?” I called out, riding my own mount between them. “The earth here judges weight. It punishes force.”

Ponnan brought his horse alongside mine as the line wheeled back toward firmer ground.

“This earth has judged hooves longer than you have ridden, Deccan man,” Ponnan said quietly. “We learned that under other kings.”

“Then teach your Madurai friends,” I said. “Today they followed me into the bog. Tomorrow they follow you around it.”

His eye flicked to Raza Khan, still cursing at his mount, then back to me.

“We will see whose tricks the Dutch remember,” he said.

Raza Khan had wrestled his horse back to firm ground. He looked furious, shaking sand from his stirrup.

“It is a bog,” he spat. “No cavalry can fight here.”

“The Dutch will be here,” I said. “If you cannot fight where they stand, why did you take the King’s coin?”

He glared at me, but the anger was cooled by the shame of the stumble.

“Again,” I said. “But this time, do not fight the ground. Let the horse find the bottom before you ask for the turn. You must ride with the sand, not against it.”

We spent the morning in that slurry.

I stripped the pageantry from them. No formations. No lances. Just men sweating in the heat, learning that the Malabar coast did not care about their lineage. I made them mix their lines, one heavy Madurai horse, one light Maravar pony.

“Watch him,” I told a Madurai rider whose beast was lathered and trembling. I pointed to a Maravar youth whose pony stood calm. “He does not force the step. He waits for the sand to hold him.”

The sun climbed. The heat turned the air liquid.

“This is not war,” Raza Khan grumbled as we paused for water. “This is labour.”

“It is the only war that matters today,” I said. “The Dutch carry muskets that fire in volleys. Precise. Mechanical. If you charge them straight, they will break you. You must come at them like the tide, fast, from the angle they do not expect, and gone before they can reload.”

Raza Khan wiped his face. “To ride like the tide, one must first not drown in the sand.”

“Exactly.”

I drew a line in the wet earth with a piece of driftwood.

“The Dutch line,” I said.

I drew two curves coming from the flanks.

“Us. We do not hit them. We bait them. We ride close, close enough to make them level their muskets. Then we turn. If we slip then, we die. If we turn true, they fire at ghosts, and while they reload, we take them with the sabre.”

Raza Khan looked at the crude map.

“It is a gamble,” he said. “To ride into the teeth of the gun and turn away.”

“It is better than riding into the teeth and staying there,” I said.

“If the horses hold,” he murmured.

“Make them hold.”

We went back to the work. Slowly, muscle by muscle, the rhythm changed. The Madurai horses stopped fighting the ground. The riders stopped jerking the reins. They began to feel the heavy, sucking pause of the sand and ride through it.

The change came first in the saddle. Horses moved under their riders with a new give, the subtle shift from resistance to acceptance. Men began to trust that their mounts would not vanish under them at every turn. Horses began to trust that their riders would not ask for impossible strides.

On the bluff, the awning's edge moved again. The king rose, stretching his legs. He spoke to Ramayyan in words I could not catch. The diwan inclined his head and wrote a few final marks on his palm leaves.

When the run ended I rode up the slope to them, sweat drying on my skin, sand clinging to my legs.

Marthanda Varma watched the riders regroup below, tiny figures against the shining strip of water.

“You make them move like fish,” he said, without preamble. “Not like bulls.”

“Fish do not charge muskets,” I said. “But yes. If your enemies expect bulls, better to be something else.”

He nodded slowly.

“They are not yet ready,” he said. “But they are less foolish than they were at sunrise.”

Ramayyan looked up from his palm leaves.

“They obeyed you,” he said. “Even when their pride bucked harder than their horses.”

“They obeyed the king's order,” I said. “I am only the voice today.”

“Voices matter,” Ramayyan said. “Especially when the sea is loud.”

The king's gaze shifted to the horizon, where a line of darker blue hinted at deeper water.

“The Dutch think these sands belong to them,” he said softly. “They think their boots and bayonets make them owners. Show me, Nagoji Sawant, that horses can disagree.”

I bowed my head once.

“I will try,” I said.

As I rode back down toward the strip of wet sand where Madurai and Maravar horsemen waited, catching their breath, a strange mixture tightened in my chest.

Fear, yes. Responsibility, sharp as any spear point. But also something I had not felt since before Goa, before the dungeon, before the storm.

Anticipation.

---

That evening, after the horses had been rubbed down and the men had scattered to their cook fires, I walked among the picketed mounts.

In the Deccan, I had ridden Kanka, a black mare with a temper like monsoon lightning and a stride that ate distance. She had died at Vasai, a Portuguese ball through her chest, and I had walked the last miles to Goa on foot, too stunned to mourn properly.

The horses here were different. Smaller, most of them. The Maravar ponies stood barely fourteen hands, their coats rough, their eyes watchful. The Madurai horses were taller, bred for show as much as war, their lines elegant but their temperaments uncertain in this strange wet land.

I had learned, in my months on this coast, that horses were not native to Kerala in the way they were to the Deccan or the Rajput lands. The monsoon rotted hooves. The humidity bred sores and fevers that could kill a horse in a week. The dense palm groves and flooded paddy fields left no room for the open grazing that built strong cavalry stock. Every war horse on this coast was an import, carried by ship or walked down through the mountain passes, and every one of them cost more than a soldier's yearly wage.

A good Madurai charger, the kind Raza Khan's men rode, cost fifty pagodas if you bought it young and trained it yourself. A proven war horse, one that had seen battle and not bolted at the sound of cannon, could fetch twice that. Arab horses, brought by traders through Gujarat and the Konkan ports, commanded three or four times as much, their desert bloodlines prized for endurance and speed. But Arabs suffered worst in this climate. I had seen them arrive sleek and proud, and within a season turn dull-coated and listless, their lungs thick with the wet air, their legs swelling from standing in mud.

The Maravar ponies were different. They were not beautiful. No raja would ride one in a procession. But their ancestors had lived on this coast for generations, bred by families who valued survival over elegance. They knew the monsoon in their bones. Their hooves were hard and narrow, shedding water instead of holding it. Their coats grew thick with oils that turned the rain. They ate the coarse grasses that grew between the paddies, food that would give a Madurai charger colic.

The smart commanders mixed their cavalry. Maravar ponies for the scouts, the flankers, the men who needed to move fast through terrain that would swallow a heavier horse. Madurai and Arab stock for the shock troops, the ones who would hit a line once and hit it hard, then withdraw before the ground could trap them.

It was expensive. Ramayyan had shown me the accounts once, his stylus tapping each line as if the numbers pained him. More coin went to feeding and replacing horses than to paying the men who rode them. But without cavalry, the king was just another petty chief with spears. With cavalry, he could strike where the Dutch did not expect, move faster than their infantry could march, and remind every rival raja that Travancore's reach extended beyond its forts.

One horse caught my attention.

She was a bay mare, neither Madurai nor Maravar, something in between, probably bought from a trader who dealt with both coasts. Her coat was the colour of ochre red earth after rain, that deep red-brown that seemed to hold the earth's heat. She stood at the edge of the picket line, watching me approach with an expression I recognized.

Wariness. Interest. The calculation of a creature deciding whether to trust.

I held out my hand, letting her smell the salt and sweat on my palm.

“You do not belong to any of them either,” I said softly. “Do you?”

She snorted, breath warm against my fingers, then, unexpectedly, pushed her nose into my chest.

The smell of her filled my head: hay and sweat and something else, something green and unfamiliar, the herbs they fed the horses here to keep them cool in the coastal heat. It was not Kanka's smell. It never would be.

But it was honest.

“Kayal,” I said, the word coming unbidden. It was the Malayalam name for the backwaters, those brackish channels that threaded through this coast like veins. “You will learn the sand with me. And when the Dutch come, we will show them what a backwater horse can do.”

She tossed her head, as if agreeing to terms she had not yet heard.

It was the first time since Vasai that I had named a horse. The first time I had let myself care whether one particular animal lived or died.

Some bonds are forged in battle. Others in the quiet after, when the sun sets and a man stands alone with a creature who asks nothing but grain and a steady hand.

Kayal would carry me through Colachel and beyond. But that night, all I knew was the warmth of her breath and the red-brown of her coat, and the strange comfort of belonging, even a little, to this unfamiliar land.

---

Ibrahim found me there, still standing with my hand on Kayal's neck.

“You talk to horses,” he said. “I have seen men talk to worse.”

“Horses do not argue,” I said. “They simply refuse, or they follow. It is simpler than men.”

He leaned against a palm trunk, his face half-shadowed by the evening light.

“You are Hindu,” he said. It was not a question.

“After a fashion,” I said. “The Portuguese tried to convince me otherwise. It did not take.”

“And yet you pray to their god when it suits you,” he said. “I have seen you bow your head in their churches. I have seen you touch the wall of a mosque without spitting.”

“I pray to whatever is listening,” I said. “If the gods are as numerous as men say, surely one of them has time for a cavalryman with sand in his boots.”

Ibrahim was quiet for a moment.

“I am Muslim,” he said finally. “My fathers came from the coast of Arabia, traders who married local women and stayed. We built mosques. We kept the faith. But we also lit lamps at Hindu shrines when our ships sailed, and we asked Christian priests to bless our cargo when the winds were wrong.”

He shrugged.

“On this coast, the gods mix like the waters of the backwaters, salt and fresh, never quite one thing. A man who insists on purity drowns faster than one who learns to float in both.”

“And the king?” I asked. “Does he care which god you bow to?”

“The king cares that I bring him information and that I do not sell it to the Dutch first,” Ibrahim said. “My prayers are my own business. As long as I am useful, he does not ask whether I face Mecca or the temple when the sun rises.”

He pushed off from the tree.

“You are useful too, Sawant. That is why you are still alive. The king does not keep men for their faith. He keeps them for what they can do. Remember that, when you wonder why a Muslim sailor and a Hindu horseman and a Christian merchant all sit in the same war hall.”

He walked away into the gathering dark.

I stayed with Kayal a while longer, thinking about gods and usefulness and the strange tolerance of a king who measured men by their hands, not their prayers.

On Deccan soil, I had thought I knew the limits of what a horse could do against a gun. Here, with the sea muttering at my back and wet sand underfoot, those limits shifted.

Storms did not ask permission. Perhaps horses, taught well, did not either.
