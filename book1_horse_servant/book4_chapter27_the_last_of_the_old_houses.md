# Chapter 27: The Last of the Old Houses

The map in the war hall had grown crowded.

Not with our own marks, with others'. Ramayyan had drawn them in different inks, each colour a different threat, each line a different direction from which death might come.

To the north, in red: Mysore. Its growing power was still half rumour, half fact, a hill kingdom learning to move men and guns like a single body. Its eyes, they said, turned toward every coast that grew pepper.

To the northeast, in black: the Nizam's lands. Hyderabad was far, but its armies were not. They had swallowed kingdoms larger than Travancore for breakfast and forgotten their names by dinner.

To the east, in brown: Arcot. The Nawab there played games with the British and the French, selling his loyalty to whoever paid most that season. His cavalry could ride south if anyone made it worth their while.

And all around the coast, in blue: the Europeans. Dutch. Portuguese. British. French. Each with ships, each with guns, each with the patient hunger of men who thought in generations.

“We are small,” Marthanda Varma said, his finger tracing the borders of his kingdom. “Smaller than any of them. If they came together, if even two of them agreed to split us, we would last a season. Perhaps two.”

He looked up at me.

“Do you know why I have spent twenty years taking every small kingdom on this coast?”

It was not a question that expected an answer. But I gave one anyway.

“To deny them footholds,” I said. “Every petty raja who might sell his port to Mysore or his pepper to the Dutch without your leave. Every chief who might open a back door while you face the front.”

“Partly,” he said. “But there is more.”

He gestured at the map.

“A hundred small kingdoms are a hundred small throats to cut,” he said. “One larger kingdom is a single throat, yes, but it is also a single fist. I do not take these lands because I am greedy. I take them because divided, we are meat. United, we are at least a problem.”

By then Padmini Amma was gone.

The fever that followed the last rains had taken her in three days, quick and unsentimental as she would have chosen. The same jackfruit tree that had shaded her stick when she scolded kings shaded the pyre where her body burned, the smoke carrying the smell of ghee and pepper leaves into a sky that had watched her all her life.

Her heir was her sister's girl, Nandini, still small enough that the brass water pot she carried looked too big for her hands. The house elders came to Velinadu and to the fort both, cloths knotted tight in worry, and asked Revathi and me to stand with them until the child was old enough to carry the name herself.

As Padmini's adopted son, some duties fell to me that no woman, however senior, could perform in the eyes of temple and custom. It was my hand that carried the fire to her pyre. It was my shoulder that helped bear her body around the inner stones before the flames took her. When the priests recited the rites that mark a house's loss, they looked to me to answer where a son might have stood.

I did not inherit that estate. No man truly does here. But as Padmini's adopted son and Revathi's husband, I became its caretaker. When tax men came or Marakkars haggled or temple stewards asked about lamp oil, it was my hand that signed beside Nandini's mark. My work was to keep the roof sound and the vines alive until she grew into her own temper.

Only once that duty was settled did the king begin to speak aloud of Kottarakkara.

Ramayyan set down his stylus.

“Kottarakkara,” he said quietly.

The name fell into the room like a stone into water.

“Yes,” the king said. “Kottarakkara. The last of the old houses that still believes it can stand alone.”

---

I had known this day was coming.

The foreshadowing had been there for years, in Revathi's silences, in Padmini's careful warnings, in the notes Ramayyan kept that I had glimpsed and pretended not to understand.

Kayamkulam had fallen. Thekkumkur and Vadakkumkur were ours. But now a new name rose.

Kottarakkara. Savitri.

Names that meant nothing to me when I first washed up on this coast, and everything now.

The Raja of Kottarakkara had finally pushed too far. Dutch factors in his court. Letters intercepted that spoke of “alternatives” to Travancore rule. When we marched, he fled to Kochi, leaving the throne empty. But his kinswoman remained.

“He thinks he can play them against us,” Ramayyan said. “He thinks if he makes himself useful to the Dutch, they will protect him from our reach.”

“They will eat him,” I said. “After they use him to weaken us.”

“He knows that too, somewhere in his mind,” Ramayyan said. “But pride is a powerful drug. His grandmothers held this land before our king's line took the throne. He cannot accept that the world has changed.”

“And Savitri?” I asked.

The name tasted strange on my tongue. Revathi's kinswoman. The woman whose claim to Kottarakkara was as legitimate as any could be under the old laws.

“She waits,” Ramayyan said. “She writes letters to Velinadu asking what Revathi will do when the hammer falls. She writes letters to the Dutch asking what they will offer if she raises a banner. She is not foolish. She prepares for every outcome.”

“Including the one where we win,” I said.

“Including that one,” he agreed.

---

The campaign against Kottarakkara was not like Colachel.

There was no single beach, no dramatic charge. It was a slow strangulation, a series of small moves that cut the chief off from his allies, his trade, his hope.

We blocked the roads his merchants used. We diverted the canals that fed his fields. We made it known to every house that traded with him that Travancore's memory was long and its patience short.

“This is not war,” Lannoy said one evening as we watched supply carts move toward our forward positions. “This is siege without walls.”

“Walls can be rebuilt,” I said. “What we are breaking cannot.”

Within months, the siege lines around Kottarakkara were complete. The Raja fled to Kochi. But Savitri did not run. She stayed to claim the chair he left behind.

And then Savitri's letter came.

---

She claimed what was hers by right.

Under the matrilineal laws of her house, she was the senior woman of Kottarakkara. With the raja fled and no male heir of age, the succession passed to her. She demanded recognition. She demanded Kottarakkara.

She demanded what Marthanda Varma had already decided to keep.

“If I give her the throne of Kottarakkara,” he said in the war hall, “every house I have absorbed will see it as permission to demand the same. The Kollamkara remnants. The Kayamkulam kin. The Thekkumkur nephews. The dozen petty rajas whose lands now feed our army. They will point to Savitri and say, see, the old ways still hold.”

“And if you refuse?” I asked.

“Then I make an enemy of a woman with legitimate grievances and powerful friends,” he said. “The Dutch will use her. And Velinadu...”

He did not finish. He did not need to.

Velinadu was Revathi. And Revathi was blood kin to Savitri.

“This was always going to happen,” Ramayyan said. “We knew it when we first moved against Kottarakkara. We knew that one day a woman would stand in this hall and demand what her grandmothers held.”

“Did you know it would be her?” the king asked.

“I knew it would be someone like her,” Ramayyan said. “Sharp. Legitimate. Connected. The worst kind of enemy: one who is not wrong.”

---

I met Savitri at Kottarakkara, in the old palace where she had barricaded herself when Travancore's pressure grew too strong.

She was older than I had expected, lines of care etched around her eyes and mouth. But she held herself like someone who had spent a lifetime being told she could not, and had decided otherwise.

“The Maratha rider,” she said when she saw me. “Marthanda Varma's foreign sword.”

“I am not here to fight you,” I said.

“No,” she agreed. “You are here to measure me. To see if I am the kind of threat that can be bought, or frightened, or simply waited out.”

“And which are you?”

She smiled, but there was no warmth in it.

“I am the kind that remembers,” she said. “My kinsman died in a room he could not leave, asking for air, asking for home. Your king calls that statecraft. I call it murder dressed in manners.”

“He threatened Travancore's unity,” I said. “He invited our enemies into his court.”

“He defended his house,” she said. “As his mothers did before him. As I will.”

She stepped closer.

“Do you know why your king fears the matrilineal law?” she asked. “It is not because it is old. It is because it gives women like me standing. A claim that does not depend on which man thinks he owns me. Your king builds a state where power flows downward from one throne. We come from a world where it flows sideways, through sisters, through daughters, through the women who remember.”

“That world is ending,” I said.

“Perhaps,” she said. “Or perhaps it will outlast his walls. Empires fall. Women remain.”

She turned away.

“Tell him I will not disappear quietly,” she said. “Tell him that if he denies my claim, I will find allies who respect it. Tell him that the Dutch have already made offers. Tell him that when Mysore finally moves south, they will remember which houses resisted Travancore and reward them.”

“You would sell your coast to the very powers you claim to oppose?” I asked.

“I would survive,” she said. “That is what women like me have always done. We outlast the men who think they own us. We tend our gardens long after their forts have fallen.”

---

The battle came at Kottarakkara, as we knew it would.

Savitri had fled to the Dutch when the palace walls could no longer hold. They had armed her cause, gathered men from the chiefs who still resented Marthanda Varma's rising hand. It was their last play, their attempt to reclaim through proxy what they had lost on Colachel's beach.

The fighting was ugly.

Not the clean chaos of cavalry charges and musket volleys. This was house land, temple land, ground where every tree held a memory. Men fought not just for pay or king, but for the idea that the old names still meant something.

I saw Savitri once, across a field of trampled paddy. She sat her horse in white mourning clothes, now grey with dust and smoke. A sword hung at her side. Behind her, men with Dutch guns and local spears waited for orders.

Our eyes met.

She did not look like a villain. She looked like a woman who had weighed her choices and found them all bitter.

We won.

Not because we were right, but because we had more. More guns. More discipline. More of the terrible arithmetic that decides such things.

By evening, her force had scattered. The Dutch factors fled toward their ships. The local men melted back into the land, hoping to be forgotten.

Savitri herself was captured trying to reach the coast.

---

They brought her to the king's tent as the sun set over the field where her hopes had died.

Her hands were bound. Her face was bruised. But she stood straight, and when she looked at Marthanda Varma, there was no surrender in her eyes.

“You could have run,” he said.

“This is my land,” she replied. “I will not watch it from a ship.”

He rose and walked to where she stood.

For a long moment, neither spoke.

“I met you once,” he said finally. “When we were young. Before any of this. You had a laugh that carried across courtyards.”

Something flickered in her face. Memory. Pain.

“I have not laughed in a long time,” she said.

“No,” he agreed. “Neither have I.”

He turned away, then back.

“I will not kill you,” he said. “I will not imprison you. You will go to Kochi, to the Dutch who promised you so much and delivered so little. You will live there. But you will not return. If you set foot in Travancore again, I will treat you as I would any invader.”

“Exile,” she said.

“Survival,” he replied. “More than your kinsman received.”

Her jaw tightened.

“You are building something,” she said. “I see it. These forts. These armies. One kingdom where a hundred stood. Perhaps it will hold against Mysore. Perhaps it will outlast the Dutch. Perhaps your name will be spoken with respect a hundred years from now.”

She leaned forward.

“But remember this,” she said. “Every house you broke, every succession you denied, every woman you sent into exile, we become stories. And stories outlast walls. When your forts are ruins and your laws are dust, someone will remember what you took. They will remember me.”

“Let them,” he said. “I build for the living, not the remembered.”

“That,” she said, “is why you will never understand us.”

They led her away toward the coast, toward a ship that would carry her to a place she could see but never again touch.

I watched until she was gone from sight, this woman who had been willing to burn everything for the right to remain. The smoke from Kottarakkara's fields drifted across the evening sky, mixing with the salt air from the sea that would carry her into exile.

The last of the old houses had fallen.

Now came the work of making sure they could never rise again.
