# Chapter 24: Under De Lannoy's Standard

By the time the first dry season after Kollamkara's valley campaign came and went, people in the fort had started calling one of the new bastions “the foreigner's tooth.”

They said it half in jest, half in grudging respect.

From that bastion, De Lannoy and I watched a unit of cavalry and infantry move through a combined drill that would have made both my younger self and his former company captains splutter.

Maravar horse trotted along the base of the wall, then wheeled, moving in pairs between marked posts. Behind them, musketeers lowered their weapons in controlled waves, firing over the horses' backs at imaginary targets in the scrub beyond. At intervals, a small cannon boomed, its recoil checked by well-braced wheels.

The air smelled of burned powder, sweat and red dust.

“They are improving,” Lannoy said, shading his eyes with one hand as he watched.

“You sound almost pleased,” I said.

“Almost,” he agreed.

We stood under a banner that combined our worlds.

The king's emblem flew at the top of the staff, but below it hung a smaller pennant bearing a simple design Lannoy had drawn himself: a diagonal line, representing the fort wall, crossed by a curved one, representing horse movement.

“If you insist on naming bastions after me,” he had said when he first heard the soldiers muttering “foreigner's tooth,” “I insist on at least choosing a decent symbol.”

I had shrugged.

“Better a tooth than a sore,” I had said. “At least this one bites outward.”

Not everyone liked how sharp that bite was becoming.

In court, whispers had grown.

“The Deccan rider and the Dutch captain,” one chief said once, loud enough for the words to travel. “Two foreigners teaching us how to use our own land.”

“Teaching us how to keep it,” Padmini had replied. “If you prefer to learn from men who have never seen a European musket up close, that is your choice. Do not complain when your sons bleed for it.”

Still, the resentment was there.

We felt it in the way some chiefs delayed sending men for drills, citing weather or harvests. We heard it in the sharper questions posed in the hall when Ramayyan suggested new levy structures. We saw it in the tightened mouths of certain officers when the king listened more closely to Lannoy's fortification advice than to theirs.

“We must not become a separate standard,” Lannoy said to me one evening as we walked along the rampart. “If they see us as a force within a force, we will be cut out like a tumour when the monarchy changes.”

“You think that will happen?” I asked.

He shrugged.

“In my land, kings fall,” he said. “In yours, too. We would be naive to think this court will look the same ten years from now.”

“We fight for the structure, then,” I said. “Not the man.”

“We fight so that whoever sits on that platform cannot easily undo what we have built without making himself vulnerable to men with better guns,” he said. “It is a selfish defence, in a way.”

“Selfish defence keeps people alive,” I said.

He laughed.

“There you go with your unpleasant truths again,” he said.

Our partnership had settled into a rough rhythm.

We still argued, about walls and patrols, about how much to build and how much to risk in motion.

Ramayyan stepped in, not as judge, but as balancer. “Stone where you must, earth where you can. Drill, but do not go blind on the marches.” When I told him he spent as much time keeping the two of us from killing each other as keeping the king alive, he replied, “It is all the same work. Preventable deaths exhaust me.”

Our men, meanwhile, learned to see us not as two rival courts, but as two facets of the same demand.

On one hot afternoon, during a combined drill, a young Nair musketeer fired too early, his shot kicking up dust far from the wooden target.

“Again,” Lannoy barked, surprisingly fluent in Malayalam now.

The youth flinched, began to fumble with his powder horn.

“Breathe,” I called from my horse's back as I trotted past. “The gun does not fear your heartbeat. Make it go slower than the drum.”

Later, when the same recruit managed to fire in perfect time over the heads of passing cavalry, both of us nodded.

“Good,” Lannoy said.

“Now do it when someone is shouting in your ear,” I added.

The boy grinned, sweat dripping into his eyes.

"Yes, Kappittan, yes, Pillai," he said.

He did not seem to care which of us got which title. We were both, to him, men who made his arms ache and his shoulders remember new positions.

It was in such small, shared approvals that our partnership took root.

Outside the fort, the world did not stop. New powers stirred inland, and new flags began to appear at northern ports.

“The Dutch are no longer the only storm,” Ibrahim said one evening over a cup of toddy. “Now there are others.”

“We will need more than one tooth,” Padmini said. “And more than one kind of jaw.”

Revathi watched from Velinadu with her usual layered gaze.

“You and De Lannoy are useful,” she said to me on one of my visits. “You are also convenient scapegoats.”

“Scapegoats?” I asked.

“If the army fails, they will say the foreigner misled it,” she said. “If it grows too strong, they will say the foreigner twisted it. Either way, men who resent change will blame you rather than their own laziness.” Her gaze drifted toward the foreigner's tooth. “If a wall ever falls, I would rather it land on the Dutchman who designed it than on my people,” she added once, without a smile.

“You make the future sound bleak,” I said.

“I make it sound like what it often is,” she replied. “Complicated.”

---

The king's next demand made Revathi's complications feel almost simple.

He held up the coat as if it were a trophy.

White cotton, cut long in the European fashion, with buttons of brass running down the front like a column of small suns. Beneath it, a waistcoat of red. Beside these, breeches that stopped at the knee, stockings, and shoes with buckles that caught the lamplight.

“This,” Marthanda Varma said, “is what my army will wear.”

The war hall had gone very quiet.

I stood among a dozen officers, Nair captains, Maravar commanders, a few men from the hired Madurai regiment. De Lannoy stood apart, near the maps, his face carefully blank.

“The drill is European,” the king continued. “The muskets are European. The cannon are cast to European patterns. The forts are built to European designs.” He set the coat down on the table. “It is time the men who use these things look as if they belong to the same army.”

One of the older Nair captains shifted his weight.

“Maharaja,” he said carefully, “our men have always worn...”

“What they pleased,” the king finished. “And they have fought as individuals who happened to stand near each other. That ends. When a Dutch officer looks through his glass at my lines, I want him to see something that makes his stomach turn. Not a rabble. A machine.”

He turned to De Lannoy.

“You have seen European armies. Tell them.”

Lannoy stepped forward. His Malayalam had grown fluent over the years, though his accent still marked him.

“In Europe,” he said, “when regiments dress alike, they move alike. The eye learns to follow the pattern. A man who breaks formation is visible at once. His officers can correct him. His comrades can support him.” He paused. “More than this, when an enemy sees a line of men dressed the same, he sees not individuals but a wall. Walls are harder to break than crowds.”

“And,” the king added, “when those walls wear coats that look like the ones his own army wears, the enemy hesitates. He wonders if reinforcements have arrived. He wonders if his maps are wrong. Hesitation kills.”

The logic was sound. I knew it. Every officer in that room knew it.

But when I looked at the coat on the table, I did not see logic.

I saw Goa.

I saw Portuguese soldiers in their white and red, walking the corridors of the fortress where I had hung in chains. I saw the officer who had supervised my interrogation, adjusting his cuffs before giving the order for the next round. I saw the guards who had dragged Keshavrao and me to the ship, their buckled shoes clicking on stone floors slick with monsoon damp.

The coat was not Portuguese. The cut was different, the buttons plain rather than ornate. But the colour, the shape, the entire idea of wrapping myself in European cloth...

My throat tightened.

"You have concerns, Pillai," the king said.

It was not a question.

“I have served you in the clothes I brought from the Deccan,” I said. “They have not prevented me from drilling your horse or riding in your campaigns.”

“No,” he agreed. “But your horse are a small part of this army. When the full force marches, I want one face. Not many.”

“The men will resist,” I said. “They will see this as...”

“Foreign,” he said. “Yes. As they saw muskets once. As they saw star forts. As they saw firing by volley instead of by whim.” His eyes held mine. “They learned. So will you.”

He turned to the room.

“Coats will be issued within the month. Officers will set the example. Dismissed.”

The others filed out. I stayed.

The king did not seem surprised.

“You are thinking of Goa,” he said.

“I am thinking of many things.”

“You are thinking that this coat looks like the coat of the men who broke your fingers and chained you in a ship's hold.” He picked up the garment, examining it. “It is not the same coat. The men who wear it will not be the same men.”

“Knowing and feeling are different animals,” I said.

“Yes,” he said. “They are. But I do not have time to wait for your feelings to catch up with your knowledge. The Dutch will return in some form. Other Europeans will come. When they do, I want them to see an army that they recognise and fear.”

He set the coat down and walked to the window.

“Talk to De Lannoy,” he said. “He wears the coat already. Ask him how it sits on a man who once wore a different one.”

---

I found Lannoy on the bastion they still called the foreigner's tooth.

He was watching the evening drill, a cup of toddy in his hand. The setting sun painted the training ground in shades of copper and dust.

“You stayed behind,” he said without turning. “I assume you did not simply want to admire the buttons.”

“The king told me to speak with you.”

“Ah.” He took a sip. “About the coat.”

“About wearing the coat.”

He nodded slowly, still watching the men below.

"When the fort burned at Colachel," he said, "I expected to die. I had seen what happens to European officers who surrender to an Indian king. A rope if you are unlucky. A cell if you are not. What I did not expect was to be offered a choice."

“The king's offer.”

“Yes. Serve Travancore, or rot in a cell until the war ended and the company forgot my name.” He laughed softly. “They would not have lifted a finger. I knew too much about their failures. Dead men cannot testify.”

He turned to face me.

“The first time I put on Travancore colours, I felt as if I had swallowed broken glass. Every thread reminded me that I was no longer Dutch. That the company's books had written me off. That my mother would light candles for a son who had become, in their eyes, a traitor.”

“And now?”

He looked down at his coat, the same white cotton the king had displayed, though worn and patched at the elbows.

“Now it is cloth,” he said. “It keeps the sun off my shoulders and the rain off my back. The man inside has not changed. He has simply learned to wear a different skin.”

“You chose this,” I said. “You accepted the king's offer. I did not choose to look like a Portuguese guard.”

“No,” he agreed. “But you chose to stay. You chose to drill these men, to build these walls with me, to ride in campaigns that served this crown. Each of those choices was a thread. The coat is simply the weaving.”

I leaned against the parapet, staring at the distant line of the sea.

“In Goa,” I said, “there was an officer. He would come to the cell each morning in a coat like the one the king showed us. White, with red beneath. Brass buttons. He would check his cuffs before he gave orders. He was very particular about his cuffs.”

Lannoy said nothing.

“The coat was always clean,” I continued. “Even when there was blood on the floor. He would step around it carefully so as not to stain his shoes. Then he would leave, and the guards would do what he had ordered, and the coat would walk out as spotless as it had walked in.”

“And when you see this coat...”

“I see his cuffs,” I said. “I see his shoes. I see the door closing behind him while I hung from the chains and wondered how many more mornings I could survive.”

The evening drum sounded below. Men began to form up for the last drill of the day.

“I cannot make that memory disappear,” Lannoy said. “No one can. But I can tell you what I have learned about clothes and men.”

He moved to stand beside me, both of us looking down at the training ground.

“In Zeeland, where I was born, there is a saying: the shirt does not make the sailor, but it tells you which ship he serves. When I wore the company's coat, I served the company. I believed in their mission, their maps, their vision of what these coasts should become. When I put on this coat, I did not stop being the man who once believed those things. I simply chose a different ship.”

“And if the ship is wrong?”

“Then you are wrong with it,” he said. “But you are wrong *together*. That is what the coat means. Not that you have become European. Not that you have forgotten Goa or the Deccan or whatever home you carry in your chest. It means that when you stand in a line with these men, you are telling the world: we fight as one.”

He finished his toddy and set the cup on the parapet.

“The Portuguese who tortured you, they were not evil because of their coats. They were evil because of what they chose to do while wearing them. You have the same choice. You can wear this cloth and be the man who trains cavalry to protect Padmini's fields. Or you can refuse, and be the man who could not see past his scars to what his king was building.”

The words struck harder than I wanted to admit.

“You make it sound simple,” I said.

“It is not simple,” he said. “I still dream of Dutch ships sometimes. I wake up speaking Flemish. There are mornings when I look at the coat hanging on its peg and I feel that glass in my throat again.” He shrugged. “Then I put it on. And I go to the wall. And I do the work. Eventually, the glass becomes smaller.”

Below, a young recruit fumbled his musket drill. An officer shouted. The boy corrected himself.

I thought of Keshavrao. Of my brother's fields in the Deccan. Of Revathi's sharp eyes and Padmini's steady hands. Of every choice I had made since the storm threw me onto this coast.

The coat was cloth. The man inside would still be me.

“I will wear it,” I said.

Lannoy nodded. He did not smile or clap my shoulder or offer congratulations. He simply nodded, as one soldier acknowledges another's decision.

“The first few days will be difficult,” he said. “The cloth will feel wrong. You will want to tear it off and burn it.” A faint smile crossed his face. “I recommend against burning it. The quartermaster is very particular about inventory.”

“I will try to restrain myself.”

“Good.” He picked up his cup. “Now come. There is more toddy in the guardroom, and I want to argue with you about whether the northern patrol should be expanded.”

---

When the coats arrived a week later, I put mine on in private.

The cloth was stiff, the buttons unfamiliar under my fingers. For a long moment I stood before the small bronze mirror in my quarters, seeing a stranger.

Then I adjusted the cuffs, carefully, the way that officer in Goa had done, and walked out to the drill ground.

The men stared. A few muttered. One young horseman started to laugh, then stopped when he saw my face.

“The same drills,” I said. “Different cloth. Mount up.”

They mounted.

And we began.

---

The Portuguese came two weeks after the coats.

Not with ships or guns, but with letters and gifts, a small embassy sent from Goa to assess the kingdom that had broken their old rivals. Three men in dark cloth, one secretary with a record book, and a priest.

I was on the parade ground when they rode in, my new coat stiff across my shoulders, watching a squad of musketeers run through their paces. Ramayyan appeared at my elbow.

“The Viceroy sends his compliments,” he said, his voice dry. “And his curiosity. They wish to discuss trade. Pepper, as always.”

“The Dutch came for pepper too,” I said. “We know how that ended.”

“The Portuguese are more careful now. They have watched what happened at Colachel. They come to talk, not to threaten.” He paused. “You should be present at the audience. The king wants them to see our officers.”

I turned to follow him, and stopped.

The priest had dismounted near the stables. He was older than I remembered, his hair gone grey, his scholar's stoop more pronounced. But the ink-stained fingers were the same. The grey eyes, tired and watchful, were the same. The way his hand twitched inside his sleeve when he was uncertain, that too was the same.

Father Duarte.

He had not seen me yet. He was speaking to his secretary, gesturing toward the fortifications with something that might have been professional interest or professional concern.

More than a decade.

More than a decade since he had walked between the rows of prisoners in that dungeon, his cassock held above the filth, since he had asked me whether I believed in God or only in powder, since he had watched João reach for the tools, hesitated, and nodded anyway, since he had stood at the gate and made the sign of the cross as they led me to the ship.

I walked toward him.

My boots, European boots, buckled, the kind that had clicked on the stone floors of Goa, announced my approach. He turned, and his face went through a sequence of expressions: polite greeting, confusion, recognition, and then something I had not expected.

Fear.

“Senhor,” he said, his voice catching. His Portuguese came out rough, as if he had forgotten how to use it. “I... that is...”

“Father Duarte,” I said. I kept my voice level. “You have come a long way from Goa.”

His eyes moved over my coat, my stance, the sword at my hip, the men drilling behind me who would come if I raised my hand. He was calculating, as I had calculated once, the distance between himself and safety.

“You survived,” he said finally. “The ship... we heard it was lost in a storm.”

“Most of it was,” I said. “I did not.”

He swallowed. His hand moved toward the cross at his throat, then stopped, as if he realised the gesture would be inadequate.

“I have thought of you,” he said. “Over the years. I have wondered...”

“Whether I would come for you?”

“Whether you found what you were fighting for.” His voice steadied slightly. “That night, in the chamber, you said you fought because men who do not fight are trampled. You said God favours whoever has the better powder.” He looked at the parade ground, at the uniformed soldiers, at the fort walls built to European design. “It seems you found the better powder.”

“I found something,” I said. “Whether it is what I was fighting for, I am still deciding.”

We stood in silence. Around us, the business of the fort continued. Horses were led to water. Officers shouted commands. The secretary hovered at a distance, uncertain whether to intervene.

“I could have you arrested,” I said quietly. “There are enough men here who remember what the Portuguese did to their kin. Some of them lost brothers in your dungeons. Some of them lost more.”

His jaw tightened, but he did not look away.

“You could,” he said. “It would not be unjust.”

“No,” I said. “It would not.”

I let the silence stretch.

“But I am not going to,” I said. “Do you know why?”

He shook his head.

“Because you hesitated,” I said. “In the chamber, when João reached for the brazier, you stopped him. At the gate, when they led us to the ship, you made the sign of the cross. Not the quick one, the one that wards off evil. The slow one. The one that asks for something.”

His eyes glistened. He blinked it away.

“I asked for your forgiveness,” he said. “I have asked for it every day since.”

“I cannot give you that,” I said. “What was done to me is not mine alone to forgive. Keshavrao drowned in that storm. Others died in your cells. Their forgiveness is not mine to grant.”

I stepped closer.

“But I can tell you this, Father. You were right about one thing. The men who do not fight are trampled. And sometimes the men who fight become something they did not expect. I wear this coat now. I drill these men. I serve a king who broke your old rivals and will break anyone else who threatens his coast.”

“The man you tortured is gone,” I said. “The man who stands here now has made his choices. Some of them haunt me. Some of them I am proud of. Most are somewhere in between.”

Father Duarte nodded slowly.

“Then we are alike in that,” he said. “More than I would have thought.”

“Perhaps,” I said. “Go to your audience. Discuss your pepper. Sign whatever treaties Ramayyan puts in front of you. And when you return to Goa, tell them what you saw here. Tell them that the man they branded as property now commands the cavalry that guards this coast.”

I turned and walked back to the parade ground.

Behind me, I heard the secretary hurrying to Father Duarte's side, heard the murmur of questions. I did not look back.

That night, alone in my quarters, I took off the European coat and hung it on its peg. My hands were steady. The glass in my throat, the one Lannoy had spoken of, was still there.

But it was smaller.

---

The Prince came to the training ground three months after the coats arrived.

He was no longer the wide-eyed boy who had clung to his uncle's leg while assassins' blood pooled on temple stone. Four years had stretched him into a young man of fourteen, with his uncle's sharp cheekbones and his mother's watchful eyes. He had grown tall enough to look me in the chest, though his shoulders still carried the narrowness of youth.

“My uncle says I am to learn from you,” he said.

He stood at the edge of the drill ground, dressed not in royal silks but in a simple training tunic. Two guards hovered at a respectful distance, their hands never far from their hilts.

“Learn what?” I asked.

“How to stay alive when men want me dead.”

There was no self-pity in his voice. Only a flat acknowledgment of fact.

I remembered the temple. The curved blade flashing toward his throat. His frozen terror. The King's blood on white silk.

“Your uncle could have sent you to De Lannoy,” I said. “He knows more about European warfare than I ever will.”

“De Lannoy teaches formations,” the Prince said. “My uncle says you teach survival.”

I looked at the guards.

“They stay at the gate,” I said. “On the training ground, you are not a prince. You are a student. If I strike you, they do not interfere. If you fall, they do not help you rise. Understood?”

The Prince turned to the guards. “You heard him. Wait at the gate.”

They hesitated. One of them, an older Nair with grey at his temples, stepped forward.

“Highness, the Maharaja's orders were...”

“The Maharaja's orders were to learn from this man,” the Prince said. His voice had an edge I had not heard before. “I cannot learn if I am wrapped in silk. Go.”

They went.

The Prince turned back to me, and for a moment I saw his uncle in the set of his jaw.

“What first?” he asked.

I threw a wooden practice sword at his chest. He caught it, barely.

“First,” I said, drawing my own, “you learn how much you do not know.”

I did not go easy on him.

For the first week, I beat him thoroughly. I struck his ribs when his guard dropped, swept his legs when he overcommitted, disarmed him until he learned to recover without thinking.

He did not complain or ask to rest. When I finally called a halt each evening, he would bow, drink deeply, and return the next morning with fresh bruises layered over fading ones.

“You are trying to kill the heir,” Ramayyan observed one afternoon, appearing at my shoulder with his usual silence.

“I am trying to make him harder to kill,” I said. “There is a difference.”

“The Senior Rani has concerns.”

“The Senior Rani can train him herself if she prefers.”

Ramayyan's lips twitched. “I will tell her you said that.”

“Tell her also that he has not once asked to stop. Not once asked for special treatment. In a month, he has learned more than most recruits learn in three.”

“She knows,” Ramayyan said. “That is why she has not intervened.”

He watched the Prince take another fall, roll, and come up with his sword ready, a move I had drilled into him until his body performed it without thought.

“He will need more than sword work,” Ramayyan added.

“I know,” I said. “But sword work comes first. A king who cannot fight inspires no one.”

“A king who can only fight inspires no one either.”

"Then teach him your accounts," I said. "I will teach him how to survive long enough to use them."

---

The Senior Rani came to watch on the last day of the first month.

She did not announce herself. I noticed her only when the Prince's eyes flicked toward the edge of the training ground and stayed there a heartbeat too long. I followed his gaze and saw her standing in the shade of the armoury wall, dressed in white without ornament, her hair pulled back severely, her face unreadable.

“Continue,” I said to the Prince. “A king who is distracted by his mother will be distracted by everything.”

He flushed but returned to his stance. We drilled for another hour, the sun climbing, the dust rising. When I finally called a halt, I walked to where she stood.

“Highness,” I said. “You could have summoned me to the palace if you wished to speak.”

“I wished to see,” she said. “There is a difference between reports and observation.”

Her eyes moved to her son, who was drinking deeply from a water skin, his training tunic dark with sweat.

“He has changed,” she said. “The way he stands. The way he enters a room. Even the servants have noticed.”

“He has learned that his body can do more than he believed,” I said. “That is the first lesson. The rest follow.”

“And the cost?”

“Bruises. Sore muscles. A few cuts that will scar.” I paused. “Nothing that will not heal.”

She was silent for a moment.

“When he was born,” she said, her voice dropping, “my brother held him and wept. He knew what it meant to bring a son into a house where men with knives dream of your blood.”

She turned to face me fully.

“I have spent fourteen years keeping him alive,” she said. “Tasters, guards, astrologers. I have counted every shadow, every servant, every visitor who lingered too long near his rooms.”

“And now you send him to me to be beaten with wooden swords,” I said.

“Now I send him to you because I have realised that all my counting has made him soft.” Her jaw tightened. “At the temple, when the chaver came, he froze. My son, heir to all this, stood like a deer in torchlight while men died around him. I cannot protect him from his own paralysis.”

“He will not freeze again,” I said. “I am burning that out of him.”

“I know,” she said. “That is why I have not stopped you, despite what Ramayyan tells you about my concerns.” A ghost of a smile crossed her face. “My concerns are real. But so is my understanding that a mother's fear can become a son's chains.”

She reached into the folds of her sari and withdrew a small object, pressing it into my hand. It was a gold coin, old, worn smooth by generations of fingers.

“This was my grandmother's,” she said. “It passes from woman to woman in this house. It has no value except memory.”

“Then why give it to me?”

“I am not giving it to you,” she said. “I am showing it to you. So that you understand what you are training. Not a soldier. Not a prince. A line. Four hundred years of women who have kept this house standing while men with swords tried to cut it down.”

She took the coin back.

“If you break him,” she said, “I will have you killed. Slowly. With full knowledge of what is happening to you. Do you understand?”

“I understand, Highness.”

“Good.” She turned to leave, then paused. “He speaks of you at dinner. He says you tell him unpleasant truths. Continue. He hears too many pleasant lies from everyone else.”

She walked away, back straight, steps measured, a woman who had learned to carry weight without showing it.

The Prince appeared at my elbow, watching her go.

“She likes you,” he said.

“She threatened to have me killed slowly.”

“Yes,” he said. “That is how you know she likes you. The ones she does not like, she simply has killed. Without warning.”

I looked at him, this boy who was learning to be hard.

“Your mother is a dangerous woman,” I said.

“She is a Rani of Attingal,” he replied. “Dangerous is the least of what she is.”

---

The second month, I began to teach him to ride.

Not the ceremonial riding of processions, sitting tall on an elephant's back while servants held umbrellas. Real riding. The kind where the horse is an extension of your body, where you think in hoofbeats instead of words.

We started before dawn, when the training ground was empty and the air still cool enough to breathe without tasting dust.

“In the Deccan,” I told him as we walked the horses in slow circles, “a man's horse is his second self. When I was your age, I learned to eat and sleep only after my mount had been fed and watered.”

“We do not have the same tradition here,” the Prince said. “Our kings ride elephants.”

“Elephants are for show,” I said. “For crushing and terrifying. But a horse, a horse can take you where elephants cannot. Through gaps in lines. Around flanks. Away from danger when danger is the only certainty.”

I nudged my horse into a trot. He followed, his seat improving day by day.

“Your uncle rides well for a man raised on palanquins,” I said. “He learned because he had to. When the Pillamar hunted him, elephants would have announced his presence to every spy in the kingdom. Horses let him move like smoke.”

“He told me,” the Prince said. “He said you reminded him of the men who taught him.”

“I am not from this coast,” I said. “I do not know its roads and its rivers the way a local man would. But I know what it means to run. And I know what it means to stop running and turn to fight.”

We rode in silence for a while. The sun crept above the tree line, painting the world in shades of gold and green.

"Pillai," the Prince said. "At the temple. When the chaver came."

I waited.

“I froze,” he said. “I saw the blade and I could not move. If my uncle had not...”

“He did,” I said. “That is what matters.”

“But I should have...”

“You were ten years old,” I said. “Trained in nothing. Prepared for nothing. A grown warrior might have frozen in that moment. A boy can be forgiven.”

“I am not ten now,” he said.

“No,” I agreed. “You are not.”

I reined my horse to a stop. He did the same.

“If it happens again,” I said, “you will not freeze. Not because you are braver than you were, but because your body will know what to do before your mind has time to be afraid. That is what we are building here. Instinct that runs deeper than thought.”

“And if instinct is not enough?”

“Then you die,” I said. “As all men do, eventually. But you die moving, not standing still. You die with your sword in your hand, not in its sheath. And the men who see it will say: he was a prince who fought like a king.”

He looked at me for a long moment.

“You do not speak to me like the others do,” he said.

“Should I?”

“No,” he said. “The others speak around the truth. You speak through it.”

“Your uncle does the same.”

“My uncle is the king. He can afford honesty.” The Prince smiled, a small, wry thing that reminded me suddenly of Revathi. “The rest of the court cannot.”

“I am not of the court,” I said. “I am a Maratha who washed up on your shore and learned to wear your coats. I have nothing to gain from flattering you and nothing to lose from telling you when your guard drops.”

“That,” he said, “is why my uncle sent me to you.”

---

By the third month, I began to include him in the regular drills.

Not as a prince, but as a junior officer. He wore the same white coat as the others, stood in the same lines, took the same corrections.

At first the men were uneasy. One Nair captain muttered that the heir could not be treated like a common soldier. I told him that was the point.

The Prince did not complain. He took corrections without argument, repeated drills until his arms shook, and one afternoon hauled a collapsed recruit into the shade with his own water.

That evening, after the men had dispersed, the Prince found me on the bastion.

"Pillai," he said. "The men. They look at me differently now."

“They look at you as one of them,” I said. “Is that not what you wanted?”

“I do not know what I wanted,” he admitted. “I only knew I did not want to be the boy at the temple again. The one who stood there while others bled for him.”

“You will never be that boy again,” I said. “You have made certain of it.”

He leaned against the parapet, looking out at the training ground below.

“De Lannoy says you are too hard on the men,” he said. “He says a good commander knows when to push and when to rest.”

“De Lannoy is right,” I said. “About most things. But he was not hunted as a child. He did not grow up knowing that assassins dream of his blood. You and your uncle have a different war than the one Lannoy fights.”

“And you?”

I thought of Goa. Of the chains. Of Keshavrao's hand slipping from the rope.

“I have my own wars,” I said. “They taught me that rest is a luxury. Survival is not.”

The Prince nodded slowly.

“My uncle says you are the only man in this court who has nothing to gain from his favour,” he said. “He says that makes you dangerous. And valuable.”

“Your uncle sees too much,” I said.

“He sees enough,” the Prince replied. “He saw that I needed this. And he saw that you could give it.”

He straightened, rolling his shoulders the way I had taught him to shake off tension.

"Thank you, Pillai," he said. "For not treating me like glass."

“Glass breaks,” I said. “You are not glass. You are iron that has not yet been forged. The fire is uncomfortable. But it is necessary.”

He smiled, that wry, Revathi-like smile again.

“Then I will try to enjoy the burning,” he said.

He walked down from the bastion, past the guards who no longer hovered quite so close, past the men who nodded to him as a fellow soldier rather than bowing to him as a prince.

I watched him go, and thought of the boy in Padmini's courtyard, wide-eyed and uncertain, witnessing an adoption he did not yet understand.

That boy was gone.

In his place walked someone who might, one day, be worthy of the throne his uncle was building for him.

The artillery came under new command that season.

His name was Thoma Ittyerah, and he was the first man I met in Travancore who made the sign of the cross before touching a cannon.

He was Syrian Christian, from a family that claimed descent from converts made by the Apostle Thomas himself, long before any Portuguese ship had troubled these waters. His people had been here for centuries, trading pepper and metal while kingdoms rose and fell around them.

“My grandfather cast cannon for the Zamorin,” Thoma told me the first day we worked together. “My father cast them for Kochi. I cast them for Travancore.” He shrugged, his broad shoulders lifting beneath the simple white cloth of his tunic. “The metal does not care which king pays for the mould.”

De Lannoy had found him in the north, at a village where Syrian Christian metalworkers had been making church bells and agricultural tools for generations. What Lannoy saw was potential, men who understood fire and bronze, who could learn to shape weapons as easily as ploughshares.

“They are not soldiers,” Lannoy had reported to the king. “But they are craftsmen. Give me a year, and they will be both.”

It had taken less than a year.

Thoma now commanded the lighter artillery pieces, the field guns that could be dragged through hill country and jungle paths, the weapons that had broken Kollamkara's confidence in that bloody valley. His crews were a mix of Syrian Christians and converted Nairs, bound together by the shared language of powder and trajectory.

“You do not pray to the same gods as your men,” I observed one afternoon, watching his crew drill.

“No,” Thoma agreed. He was adjusting the elevation of a small cannon, squinting along its barrel. “But we bleed the same colour. That is enough for a gun crew.”

He stepped back and signalled. The cannon roared. Downrange, a wooden target exploded into splinters.

“The Dutch taught us that cannons are tools of discipline,” he said, as the smoke cleared. “Fire together, reload together, fire again. No room for heroes. Only for men who can count and follow orders.”

“You learned from the Dutch?”

“My uncle worked in their foundry at Kochi, before they decided that teaching Indians to cast good bronze was against company policy.” He smiled, showing teeth stained by betel. “They stopped the lessons. They could not take back what we had already learned.”

His crews worked with a precision that reminded me of temple rituals, each movement prescribed, each role understood. The loader, the rammer, the man who held the slow match. They moved around the cannon like priests around an altar, their faith not in any god but in the mathematics of fire.

It was Thoma who first told me about the Jews.

We were inspecting a shipment of saltpetre when a small boat pulled up to the dock. The man who stepped off wore a dark coat despite the heat, a cap over his head, and a beard that fell to his chest.

“Avraham,” Thoma called, raising a hand. “You are early.”

The man approached, his eyes taking in everything, the stacked barrels, the guards, me.

“The roads from Kochi are clear this season,” he said. His Malayalam was accented, the vowels shaped by some other tongue. “The king's peace has been good for travel.”

Thoma turned to me. "Ananthan, this is Avraham ben Ephraim. His family has traded with mine for four generations. Avraham, this is the Maratha, the one the soldiers call the Deccan rider."

Avraham inclined his head. “I have heard of you. The man who teaches horses to dance with muskets.”

“The man who tries,” I said. “What brings you from Kochi?”

“Saltpetre,” he said. “And other things the king requires. My people have traded on this coast longer than any European memory.”

I had heard of the Jews of Kochi, traders who kept their own quarter near the Raja's palace, but I had never spoken to one.

“You supply the king's army?” I asked.

“We supply whoever pays fairly and keeps their word,” Avraham said. “Marthanda Varma pays fairly. His Dalawa keeps accounts that even our elders respect. That is rare among kings.”

He gestured toward the barrels.

“Good saltpetre,” he said to Thoma. “From the caves near Madurai. The Tamil merchants tried to raise the price, but we reminded them that we have been trading longer than their grandfathers have been alive. They reconsidered.”

Thoma laughed. “The Jews of Kochi,” he said to me, “have a saying: 'The Portuguese came and went, the Dutch came and are going, the English are coming. We remain.'”

“We have been expelled from many lands,” Avraham said. “Spain, Portugal, half of Europe. But never from this coast. The rajas here understood something that Christian kings did not, a merchant who can trade with Arabs and Persians and Europeans alike is more valuable than any army.”

He looked at the fort rising behind us, at the star-shaped bastions and the European-style walls.

“Now you build armies too,” he added. “Perhaps that is wise. Perhaps not. We shall see what survives longer, the walls or the books.”

---

Over the following months, I learned more about the Jews of Kochi.

Thoma said there were Malabari Jews, old families woven into the coast, and Paradesi Jews, newer arrivals from Europe who still carried Spanish and Portuguese scars. Both lived under the Raja's protection near the palace, trading where others were forbidden to own land.

"They cannot own land outside their quarter," Thoma said. "But they can own ships. They can trade. And they remember everything, every debt, every favour, every slight. Do not cheat a Jew of Kochi, Ananthan. His grandson will remember."

“You speak as if you admire them,” I said.

“I speak as a Christian whose ancestors were here before Portugal existed,” Thoma replied. “We know what it means to be ancient in a land that others call new. The Jews understand. The Nairs understand, though they would not admit it. Even you Marathas, with your old forts and older gods, you understand.”

He adjusted the cannon we were inspecting, tightening a wheel bolt.

“The Dutch and the Portuguese, they think history began when their ships arrived. They write their books and draw their maps and believe they are the first to see these shores.” He spat into the dust. “This coast has buried empires before them. It will bury more.”

I thought of Goa, and of men certain their faith and their flags made them superior to the men they tortured.

“And yet we wear their coats now,” I said. “And fire their cannons.”

“We wear what is useful,” Thoma said. “We fire what works. That is not surrender. That is wisdom.” He smiled. “The Jews taught us that, too. Survive first. Remember always. And never forget who tried to destroy you.”

Avraham came to the fort several more times that season, always with goods the army needed, saltpetre, sulphur, copper for casting, cloth for uniforms. Each time, he and Thoma would sit together over cups of arrack, speaking in a mixture of Malayalam and Portuguese and something else that I later learned was Ladino, the old Spanish tongue the Paradesi Jews had carried with them across the seas.

One evening, I joined them.

“You ask many questions,” Avraham observed, after I had spent an hour learning about trade routes and currency exchanges and the complex web of debts and favours that connected Kochi to Basra to Amsterdam.

"I was a soldier," I said. "Soldiers learn to read terrain. This," I gestured vaguely at the account books and manifests spread between us, "is terrain I never learned to read."

“It is simpler than you think,” Avraham said. “Every transaction is a story. Who needs what. Who has what. What they will trade to get what they need. Follow the story, and you understand the trade.”

“And what story does Travancore tell?” I asked.

He was quiet for a moment, turning his cup in his hands.

“Travancore tells a story of a king who learned that pepper is power,” he said. “Who saw that the Europeans would bleed each other dry for control of the spice trade, and decided to make them bleed on his terms instead of theirs. It is a clever story. We shall see if it has a happy ending.”

“You doubt it?”

“I doubt all kings,” Avraham said. “My people have learned that lesson in many lands. But this king...” He paused. “This king pays his debts. That is worth something.”

He stood, gathering his papers.

"My grandfather traded with the Zamorin," he said. "My father traded with Kochi. I trade with Travancore. My son will trade with whoever holds this coast when I am gone." He smiled, and there was something ancient in his eyes. "The Jews endure, Pillai. We have outlasted Pharaohs and Caesars and Inquisitors. We will outlast kings of pepper, too."

He left, his small boat disappearing into the gathering dusk.

Thoma and I sat in silence for a while, watching the lamps being lit along the walls.

“Strange allies, these,” I said.

“All allies are strange,” Thoma replied. “Until you need them.”

One evening, after a particularly long day of drills and disputes, Lannoy and I ended up in the fort's small armoury, checking a new shipment of blades.

He picked up a talwar, feeling its weight.

“Your swords are better for cutting from horseback,” he said. “Our straight blades are better for thrusts on foot.”

“We make do with what the land asks,” I said. “If the ground is cluttered, curve your steel.”

He tested the edge with his thumb, then flipped the sword, offering it hilt first.

“If we are to be blamed together, we may as well be armed together,” he said.

I took the blade.

“You have accepted that you will never go back,” I said.

He leaned against a rack of spears, staring at some point between us.

“Back where?” he asked. “To ships that would call me traitor? To a land that has already written my name in a different set of books?”

He shook his head.

“This is my fort now,” he said. “These are my men. If I spend the rest of my life trying to make sure they do not die as stupidly as some of my countrymen did, perhaps that will be enough to balance a few lines.”

His words echoed my own thoughts more than he knew.

We stood there in silence for a few breaths, two men far from the places that had birthed us, bound to a banner that was neither of our first choosing, yet had become ours by repeated, bloody decisions.

"Under whose standard do we truly stand, Ananthan Pillai?" he asked softly. "The king's? The idea of this place? The memory of the men who died at Colachel?"

“All of them,” I said. “On different days.”

He nodded.

“On the days when it is the king's,” he said, “we must be careful. Kings change. Places endure longer.”

“You have been talking to Revathi,” I said.

He smiled.

“She scolds me too,” he said. “Apparently my foreignness does not exempt me.”

We left the armoury and stepped out onto the wall.

Below, under the foreigner's tooth, men still drilled in the waning light.

Travancore men, moving in patterns that had never existed on this coast before European hulls, Deccan riders and Dutch captains all smashed into it.

Whatever names future scribes gave this army, for this moment, it was ours.

We stood under its standard.

Together.
