# Prequel: The Vow and the Tiger

In the late 1730s, the western coast of India smelled of wet gunpowder and pepper. Salt wind carried the tang of the Arabian Sea into every camp and every fort. Between the surf and the hills, empires pressed against each other like wrestlers, each convinced the other would tire first.

On one coast, the Portuguese still rang their church bells over Goa and flew their flags above stone walls that had learned to swallow screams. They had held this strip of land for generations, long enough to believe it belonged to them by habit. Their forts along the Konkan were a chain of white teeth, and their caravels and galleys prowled the sea lanes, guarded, when it suited them, by the dark hulled ships of the Siddis. The Siddis of Janjira were not priests and merchants like the Portuguese. They were sea fighters, a kingdom of sailors with African blood and Indian shores, hired and hated and feared in the same breath. Between them, they made the coast feel fenced.

Then the Maratha hand closed.

In Pune, Baji Rao, the Peshwa, sent orders like arrows. His younger brother Chimaji Appa carried those orders to the coast and made them personal. Chimaji was not a man who loved speeches. He loved ledgers of powder and lists of captured guns, the slow certainty of siege lines tightening. But he understood something about the Portuguese that many inland men missed. They were not unbeatable because they were white or Christian. They were dangerous because they had fort walls, cannon, and the patience of men who believed time itself worked for them.

So Chimaji vowed that time would not save them.

I heard the vow in a camp that stank of horse sweat and damp rope. The monsoon had passed, leaving the earth soft and the mosquitoes hungry. Chimaji stood in a circle of officers, a lamp smoking beside him, his face hard in the flicker. Behind him, Brahmins chanted in a small, stubborn voice, and the men answered in murmurs, hands touching sword hilts and prayer beads with equal familiarity. He did not promise easy victory. He promised that no foreign flag would be allowed to sit on Konkan soil unchallenged, not the Portuguese cross, not the Siddi banner painted on a prow. He promised to take their forts one by one, to make the coast remember who it had always belonged to.

Wars are made of such vows. They are also made of trenches, and blood, and the stubborn labour of men who drag cannon through mud.

The Konkan campaign was not a single battle. It was a grinding season of sieges and raids, forts that fell after weeks of hunger and sudden night attacks that left a road littered with broken carts and spilled grain. We learned to cut supply lines, to watch for the glint of a musket barrel in coconut groves, to move like a flood and vanish like smoke. We learned that Portuguese guns could kill a horse as easily as a man, and that a cavalry charge means nothing if the ground is chopped into ditches and sharpened stakes.

The Portuguese fought like men defending a house they had stolen and made their home. They countermined our tunnels. They bribed scouts. They sent priests to promise salvation to men who could not read their prayers. When that failed, they sent iron and rope. They broke bodies in cells under Goa and called it justice.

We broke forts instead.

At Bassein, the Portuguese fortress that watched the sea like an old predator, I saw a wall tremble under our guns. I saw men climb into smoke with ladders shaking in their hands. I saw my black mare Kanka take a ball through the chest and fold as if the ground had suddenly gone soft beneath her. In the roar and confusion, in the stink of powder and blood, I understood that campaigns turn into legends because the men who live through them need something to hold onto when the dead begin to outnumber the living.

In those months, we spoke as if Konkan was the whole world. We spoke as if Chimaji Appa’s war was the only war that mattered.

It was not.

Far south, beyond the passes and the Deccan plateau, beyond the long curve of the Malabar coast where pepper vines climbed trees like hungry fingers, another king was shaping a kingdom with the same ruthless patience. I did not meet him then. I did not even know his name beyond a rumour carried by merchants. But later, in Travancore, I learned that while Chimaji tightened his siege lines against Portuguese stone, Marthanda Varma of Venad was tightening his grip on men and land.

Venad was not supposed to frighten anyone. It was a wet strip of country pressed between the mountains and the sea, broken into quarrelling houses and temple lands, rich in pepper and coconut and river mouths, and rich, too, in the kind of small pride that makes neighbours sharpen knives. Its neighbours were older, some wealthier, some with better access to the ports, but many had lived too long under the shadow of Dutch treaties and European guns to imagine a future that was fully their own.

Marthanda Varma did imagine it.

He had the ego of a man who refuses to stay small. He dreamed of a southern empire, a single authority that could tell the pepper coast what price it would accept and which foreign ship could anchor where. To build it, he first crushed the threats inside his own house. The Thampi brothers who claimed power by blood and violence were hunted down. The *Ettuveetil Pillamar*, the Eight Houses who had treated the crown like a decoration while they ruled the land, were broken and scattered. Venad learned, in a short brutal span, that this king would not be managed.

Then he turned outward.

Small kingdoms and chiefdoms that had spent generations balancing each other suddenly found a new weight pressing on them. Some bent. Some resisted. Some ran to older powers for protection. It was in the interest of the Dutch that no single prince on the Malabar coast became too strong. A divided land made treaties easy. A divided land signed away pepper cheaply, prince by prince, without the Dutch needing to maintain an expensive army beyond the walls of their coastal forts.

So the Dutch played the coast like a stringed instrument.

Cochin, long a pivot between European powers, watched with alarm. The Samudri, the Zamorin of Calicut, understood that a king who grew too strong in the south would eventually pull at the north as well. Principalities nursed grievances and old succession disputes like infected wounds. Dutch agents offered arms and ammunition, offered promises, offered the thin comfort of European umbrellas. Alliances formed, not out of love, but out of fear.

Inside Venad, Marthanda Varma prepared anyway. He had something most of his rivals lacked, a minister who could see past today’s feud to tomorrow’s war. Ramayyan Dalawa was not a man who shouted on battlefields. He was a man who counted, who read letters in multiple tongues, who understood that pepper is not just spice but power. Under his guidance, the king gathered guns, trained men, and made a state that could endure beyond one season’s victory.

By 1738, two storms were rising on two coasts. In the west, Chimaji Appa’s vow sharpened the Maratha appetite against the Portuguese and their allies. In the deep south, Marthanda Varma’s ambition sharpened Travancore against every neighbour, every rival house, and every European company that believed this coast could be owned.

I was only a cavalryman then, one more rider in Chimaji’s shadow, thinking I knew what war was.

The Portuguese taught me otherwise.
