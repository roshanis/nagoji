# Chapter 23: First Campaign for the Tiger

The Kayamkulam frontier smelled different from the coast.

Less salt, more dust. Less pepper, more smoke from small village fires. The wind carried the sharp scent of red earth and dry grass instead of wet sand. It felt closer to the Deccan than anything I had known in years, and yet the rhythm of the land was still Travancore's.

The houses here owed the king less by habit than by calculation.

Their fields fed both his forts and their own ambitions. Their men had fought under his banner when Dutch guns threatened, but they had not forgotten that, before Marthanda Varma's rise, they had answered to weaker crowns. Some resented the new walls that rose on their ridges. Some grumbled about the levies Ramayyan's scribes counted with such care.

It was among these hills that the first campaign of my new command began.

The trouble started, as such things often do, with a rumour.

“Kollamkara Raja is entertaining foreign visitors,” a Marakkar trader said as he warmed his hands on a cup of spiced buttermilk in the fort courtyard. “Men with pale faces and boxes of cloth. They come up the river at night.”

“Dutch?” I asked.

The trader shrugged.

“Their ships sit off the coast these days with papers instead of cannons,” he said. “But their smaller craft still wander. Company men do not forget how to look for gaps.”

Ramayyan's fingers tapped on his palm leaf when he heard.

“Kollamkara sits near Padmini's northern edge,” he said. “If he tilts too far toward Dutch coin, they will have a foothold behind our forts.”

Marthanda Varma looked at me.

“You wanted a frontier,” he said. “Here it is. Go and see whether this raja needs reminding who sharpens his sword.”

So we rode.

My new command was a mixed force.

Travancore Maravar horse, lighter and quicker than Deccan cavalry, able to move through scrub and narrow paths. Arcot lancers, still a little disdainful of these inland tracks but proud of their spears. A core of Maratha riders from my own band, men who had chosen to stay in this southern service with me, their tongues and jokes still carrying the hills in them.

Behind us, on slower feet, marched a unit of musketeers and a small, mobile gun, meant more to remind the northern chiefs of the king's reach than to batter walls.

Padmini rode with us for the first day.

“My lands lie between you and his,” she said. “I would rather be there when your men look for grazing.”

Her presence did more than protect her fields.

Her stick and tongue kept certain chiefs honest.

When we stopped in the first village, a petty headman greeted us with the formalities due a royal officer, then tried to impress us with his grievances against Kollamkara.

“He takes more grain than the old agreements said,” the man complained. “He sends his men to collect 'roads tax' each season. We pay to use the paths our grandfathers cut.”

Padmini listened, then said, “You also sell pepper behind the king's back to men who come in small boats at night. Do not pretend only he stretches old lines.”

The headman flushed and fell silent.

In one village that lay between Padmini's lands and Kollamkara's hill, we rode into the middle of a temple festival.

It was not a grand thing like those I had heard of at Padmanabhapuram, but the scale did not blunt its power. Bright cloths had been tied between trees. Oil lamps flickered in niches along the outer wall. Drums and nadaswarams wound a tight melody through the air. Men and women circled the shrine with small clay lamps cupped in their hands, their faces lit from below like the carved figures on the gopuram.

We reined in at the edge of the crowd. A magnificent tusker, its forehead adorned with a gold *nettipattam*, the ceremonial forehead plate, stood near the entrance, swaying gently as children offered it bananas. No one scattered. They shifted to make space, eyes flicking to our swords and horses, then back to the small procession that wound out from the sanctum.

A group of girls carried a palanquin bearing a simple wooden image of the goddess, decked in fresh flowers. Behind them walked older women with brass plates of rice and turmeric, their steps measured. Padmini dismounted and joined them without a word, slipping into the line as if she had always been there. Men bowed their heads as she passed.

"War does not stop for this," Ponnan murmured.

“This does not stop for war either,” I said.

For a few breaths we were simply part of the circle. The lamps moved, the drums spoke, the smell of ghee and jasmine and sweat wrapped around us. Somewhere in that swirl, a boy bumped into Yusuf Marakkar, who had appeared near the food stalls, hand on a basket of sweet fried discs.

He steadied the child with an easy smile, then caught my eye and tipped his head, as if to say that business never slept, not even when gods walked. I did not know whether he had come to pay respect, to listen, or to see which chiefs showed their faces. Perhaps all three.

When the procession ended and the goddess returned to her place, Padmini came back to her horse, eyes brighter.

“Now we go remind men outside these walls that she is not the only one watching,” she said.

By the next morning, the air had thickened with a different kind of tension.

Scouts reported armed men moving near the forest edge. Smoke rose in thin columns from hidden camps. A runner brought word that a small convoy of Travancore grain, destined for the new fort, had been ambushed a few nights earlier. The attackers had left company cloth and coins on one of the bodies, either as payment or as a message.

"He wants us to know," Ponnan said as we examined the scene. "He is not hiding this. He wants the Maharaja to see Dutch colour in his quarrel."

“That way, if we strike him, he can tell other chiefs that we did it at the Dutch's bidding,” I said. “And if we do not, he can tell the Dutch we fear their anger.”

We found Kollamkara's men first.

They waited for us in a narrow valley where the road dipped between two wooded slopes.

Not a full ambush.

That would have required more patience than they possessed. It was an assertion, not an attempt to kill us all.

A line of spearmen and archers across the path. Men on the slopes with muskets. Their banners fluttered in the hot breeze, bright cloth pinned to tall poles.

At their centre sat the raja.

He was a heavy man, flesh hanging a little over his belt, but his eyes were sharp. He wore gold in his ears and around his neck, and a sword at his hip that had seen use. He sat on a low stool placed deliberately in the centre of the road, as if daring us to ask him to move.

I rode forward with Ponnan and a Nair captain at my side.

“Raja,” I said, inclining my head.

"Pillai," he said, with a mocking emphasis on the new name. "We heard the Maharaja had given a Maratha his Kayamkulam frontier. Nice of him to send you to announce yourself."

His tone walked the line between mockery and welcome.

“You block the king's road,” I said. “That is one way to greet his officer.”

“I block no one's road,” he said. “I sit on mine. If the king wishes to pass, his horse can step around me. There is plenty of ground in this valley.”

His men chuckled.

“And if Dutch coin passes along this road at night?” I asked. “Does that belong to you as well?”

His eyes narrowed fractionally.

“Dutch coin spends in our markets,” he said. “As does Marakkar coin. As does Brahmin coin. The grain you send north does not ask whose hand dropped the money it buys. Why should I?”

Ponnan shifted his weight beside me, ready for the argument to turn sharper.

I lifted a hand slightly.

“The king does not object to trade,” I said. “He objects to men using foreign guns to settle local quarrels.”

I gestured at the assembled force.

“Travancore men lie dead on that road you raided,” I said. “Their powder has company smell on it. That is not trade. That is provocation.”

For a moment, something like guilt flickered in his gaze.

Then pride smothered it.

“They took more than their due,” he said. “The new walls demand more from us than the old ones did. If the king wants to tighten his hand, he should expect us to wriggle.”

“If you wriggle into Dutch arms, do not be surprised when their grip leaves marks,” I said. “We have seen what their embrace feels like.”

His jaw clenched.

“You come here with horse and muskets and speak as if we are children,” he said. “You forget that my men bled at Colachel too. When the Dutch fell, they did not ask whether the spear in their gut belonged to a Travancore Nair or a Kollamkara one.”

He was not wrong.

Many of these men had fought under the same sky on that beach. They now stood, not exactly opposite us, but at an angle that could become sharp quickly.

“We do not forget,” I said. “Which is why the king sent me to talk before cannons. But talk has its limits.”

I glanced at the slopes.

His men watched us, shifting their weight, fingers near trigger guards.

“You know what Dutch do when they see men with muskets blocking their road,” I said. “They fire, then argue later. We are giving you the courtesy of argument first. Do not mistake it for fear.”

He looked past me at the line of Travancore musketeers behind, at the small gun, at Padmini's banner among our horse.

When he saw Padmini herself, sitting her horse under a nearby tree, face unreadable, his shoulders tightened.

“If you fight them, you fight me,” she had told him years ago over a dispute about canal water. “When you come to their aid, you spill your blood on my soil. Do not forget whose ground you stand on.”

He glanced now at the stretch of land where our two domains brushed.

"What do you want, Pillai?" he asked.

“Your men off the road,” I said. “Your promise that you will not use Dutch muskets on Travancore caravans. And your agreement that if company men come again, they do so as merchants, not as your private army.”

“And what does the king give?” he asked tightly.

“The same thing he gave at Colachel,” I said. “Proof that when Dutch turn from coins to guns, they find more sand in their mouths than pepper.”

For a heartbeat, the valley held its breath.

Then he snorted and pushed himself up from his stool.

“You speak well for a man from the hills,” he said. “Too well. It makes me suspect you have Ramayyan's ink on your tongue.”

“I have my own words,” I said. “He just helps me keep track of where they land.”

He waved his hand.

“Stand aside,” he told his men. “Let the king's horse pass. Only fools stand in front of a cannon to prove a point.”

The line parted, slowly.

It felt less like victory than like being allowed to step over a tripwire that could be reset behind us.

As we rode past, Ponnan leaned toward me.

“That was not the last of him,” he murmured.

“No,” I said. “But it is not today.”

We did not have to wait long for today.

Two weeks later, while we were still establishing our new patrol patterns and visiting smaller chiefs, smoke rose from near Padmini's northern fields.

Not cook smoke. Not temple lamps. Thick, black columns that meant burning.

By the time we reached the ridge above, the raiders were already withdrawing.

They had hit a narrow strip of pepper gardens along a canal, torching vines, cutting support poles, trampling the soil. A few of Padmini's men lay dead near the path, their bodies hacked, not shot. The raiders moved with the easy familiarity of men who knew every bend of the land.

Kollamkara's men. Wearing no company colours, carrying no Dutch muskets, but the message was clear enough: you do not frighten me with your cannon.

“He could not strike at the king,” Padmini said, her voice shaking with restrained fury. “So he struck at me instead. He thinks you will hesitate to chase him into his own scrub.”

He was wrong.

We rode hard.

The chase that followed was not like Colachel.

No neat lines. No open beach. No clear horizon.

We galloped along narrow tracks between red rock outcrops, branches whipping at our faces. We splashed through shallow streams, hooves slipping on mossy stones. We crashed through patches of scrub, ducking low to avoid branches.

Kollamkara's riders knew the breaks in the land where they could vanish. We had to force them to show us.

At one bend, they tried an ambush.

Half a dozen men burst from cover ahead, firing matchlocks at close range. Another group loosed arrows from a side thicket.

The first volley caught two of our horsemen. One fell backwards, hands clutching at a spreading dark on his chest. The other pitched sideways, his foot tangled in his stirrup, his horse dragging him for several yards before Ponnan cut the strap with his blade and hauled him clear.

We did not stop.

I drove my horse straight at the nearest shooter, my sword out.

His eyes widened as he realised his musket had not had time to reload. He dropped it and reached for a sword.

Too slow.

My blade caught his arm, biting through cloth and flesh. He yelled, stumbling back. I did not let him find his feet. I cut again, higher, the edge sliding under his jaw. He went down with a startled cough and did not rise.

Ponnan and his Maravar riders swept into the flank of the ambush, their lighter mounts darting between trees. Spears flashed. The raiders, seeing their first strike fail, disappeared back into the scrub.

As we regrouped on the far side of the bend, Ponnan rode up, sweat streaking his horse's neck.

“Your Deccan tricks work in these hills too,” he said, breathing hard. “I begin to believe you did not lie about sand and surprise.”

“I trust Maravar hooves more than my tricks,” I said. “Without you on that flank, half my plans would be corpses in the road.”

He gave a short, pleased grunt.

“Good,” he said. “Remember that when the king counts whose men bled here.”

We did not follow deep. That was their terrain. Instead, we pressed along the main path, forcing their main body to keep moving.

By late afternoon, we had pushed them toward a shallow valley choked with low thorn bushes and rocky outcrops.

The kind of place where a careless commander could lose half his men in a few breaths.

We reined in on a ridge, horses blowing hard.

“If we go in there blind, we will bleed for every shrub,” Ponnan said.

“He chose this ground for that,” Padmini said. She had insisted on coming, riding near the rear of our column, eyes flinty. “He thinks you will either rush in and lose men or pull back and let him claim he held you.”

I looked at the valley.

At the patterns of shadow and light. At the possible lines of retreat. At the rocks that could hide men with muskets.

“We do neither,” I said.

I signalled for the small gun we had brought.

Not a great battering piece like those that sat in the coastal forts. A lighter cannon, meant to be moved quickly, its crew used to dragging it over uneven ground.

We positioned it on the ridge, pointed not at a wall, but at the thickest stand of scrub where the raiders' trail vanished.

“We do not need to kill them all,” I said to the gun captain. “Just remind them that this terrain does not belong only to them.”

He nodded, sighted, and fired.

The cannon's roar echoed off the hills, startling birds from the trees. The ball tore through scrub and rock. Men shouted from below, some in pain, some in anger.

We fired twice more, adjusting slightly each time.

The cannon could not kill a whole band hidden in such cover. It could tear holes in their confidence.

“Now,” I said.

We sent in small groups on foot.

I went with the first, dismounting and drawing my talwar. In scrub like this, men die faster when you can smell each other’s breath.

The valley swallowed us.

Thorns caught at cloth and skin. Stones shifted underfoot. The air felt close, wet with the exhalations of hidden bodies.

It began with a matchlock shot that went wide, shredding leaves near my ear. Then they were on us.

A man lunged at me from behind a bush, spear low. I twisted, letting the point scrape past my hip, and drove my elbow into his jaw. Bone crunched. He staggered. I cut his hamstring, watched his leg fold, and finished him before he hit the ground.

Another came, sword raised high, face smeared with ash. I stepped inside his swing and took his throat. He made a thin sound, hands clawing at his neck, and sagged into the thorn.

A third tried to circle, dagger in his fist, eyes bright with the fever of the chase. He slipped on a loose stone. I did not let him recover. I cut across his cheek, then across his neck, and kept moving.

The world narrowed. Heat, screams, powder smoke, fresh blood, all of it sang to something dark in me. I was not just fighting. I was hunting.

I cornered a young raider against a rock face. He had lost his sword. His hands were up, eyes wide with terror.

“Mercy!” he cried.

I laughed. It was a wet, ugly sound.

“Mercy is for men who stay on their own land,” I snarled. I raised my sword, intent not just on killing him, but on splitting him to the navel.

A hand clamped onto my wrist. Iron-hard.

"Ananthan!"

I spun, ready to strike the interrupter.

Ponnan stood there, his face streaked with soot, but his eyes clear and hard. He held my arm, forcing the blade down.

“Look at him,” he hissed. “He is a boy. He is beaten.”

“He is an enemy,” I panted, the blood pounding in my ears like a war drum.

“He is not the Portuguese,” Ponnan said, his voice cutting through the haze. “We are not at Colachel, fighting white devils. These are men of the soil. Kill him if you must, but do not butcher him like a dog.”

The red receded, leaving me cold and shaking. I looked at the boy, who was sobbing now. I looked at my sword, dripping.

I lowered the blade.

“Go,” I told the boy. “Run before I remember who I am.”

He scrambled away.

Another raider burst from the scrub behind him, trying to use the boy’s body as a shield as he backed off. I stepped in and cut him down. The boy ran harder, feet slipping on rock, disappearing into the thorn.

By the time the sun slid toward the horizon, the valley was silent. The raiders who hadn't fled lay broken among the rocks.

We walked back to the ridge. Padmini was waiting.

She looked at the blood on me, too much of it to be mine, and then at the bodies being dragged into lines.

“You were thorough,” she said. Her voice was steady, but there was a flicker of something in her eyes. Not fear, exactly. Recognition.

“They will not come back,” I said. My voice sounded raspy, strange even to my own ears.

"No," Ponnan observed quietly, wiping his spear. "Ghosts rarely raid."

“Good,” Padmini said. She turned her horse. “War is not a place for half-measures.”

When we returned to the fort weeks later, report written, the reception was not what I expected.
 
 Ramayyan Dalawa sat in the audience hall, the palm leaf scroll unspooled before him. Marthanda Varma paced behind him. The air in the room was brittle.
 
 “This report,” Ramayyan said, tapping the leaf with a stylus. “It makes for... vivid reading.”
 
 “We secured the border,” I said, standing stiffly. Padmini stood beside me, her chin high.
 
 "You secured a massacre," Marthanda Varma said, stopping his pace. He turned to look at me, his eyes cold. "We sent you to deter a chieftain, Pillai. Not to paint the rocks with the entrails of his farmers."
 
 “They were armed,” Padmini cut in. “They were raiders.”
 
 “They were potential subjects,” Ramayyan snapped. “Or at least, men whose cousins pay us tax. Do you know what the gossip in the market is? That the King's new Maratha captain is a butcher. That he enjoys the kill too much.”
 
The flush rose in my neck. The memory of the red haze, of the boy I had almost split, burned.
 
 “It... got out of hand,” I said, my voice low. “The fighting was close. Confused. I lost myself.”
 
 “You are a commander,” the King said sharply. “You do not get the luxury of losing yourself. That is for foot soldiers and berserkers.”
 
 “I apologise, Your Highness,” I said, bowing my head. “It will not happen again.”
 
 “It better not,” Ramayyan said.
 
 “He has nothing to apologise for,” Padmini said, her voice ringing in the hall.
 
 We all looked at her.
 
 "They burned my fields," she said, her eyes flashing fire. "They took foreign money to threaten our flank. Ananthan did what was necessary. If the price of safety is a few bloody rocks, I will pay it."
 
 “We do not ask you to pay it, Amma,” Marthanda Varma said quietly. “We ask you to remember that we are building a kingdom, not a graveyard.”
 
“Sometimes they are the same thing,” she said. She looked from the King to me, disgust on her face, perhaps at them for their softness, perhaps at me for my apology. “I will not stand here and be scolded for surviving.”
 
 She turned and walked out, her cane striking the stone floor hard with every step.
 
 The silence she left was heavy.
 
 “Go, Ananthan,” Ramayyan said, waving a hand. “Clean yourself up. And pray that the next rumour speaks of your discipline, not your thirst.”
 
I saluted and left, feeling smaller than I had in years.

That night I scrubbed the valley off my skin until my knuckles stung. The water in the basin turned pink, then clear, and still I could taste smoke at the back of my throat.

Padmini found me before dawn.

She did not strike her cane on the floor this time. She stood in the doorway of my quarters with her shawl pulled tight and her eyes bright in the lamp glow.

“Do not let their scolding fool you,” she said.

I swallowed. “It was not scolding. It was judgment.”

“In public,” she said. “Yes.”

I said nothing.

“After I walked out,” she went on, voice low, “I went back. I needed to speak of my burned fields, and I wanted to know how far they meant to leash you. I waited outside the king’s rooms while Ramayyan went in. Their doors do not hold words as well as stone holds arrows.”

She leaned close, as if the walls themselves were listeners.

“He asked Ramayyan if Kollamkara would send men into that valley again,” she said. “And Ramayyan said no, not after what the Maratha did to the last ones. Do you know what the king said then?”

My stomach tightened.

“He said a kingdom cannot be run by butchers,” Padmini whispered. “Then he said it is very useful to have a man the enemy believes is one. Let them fear the Tiger’s claws.”

She straightened, the shawl slipping a little from one shoulder.

“So be careful,” she said. “They will shame you when eyes are watching, and they will praise you when they want you sharp. Do not let their need become your hunger.”

I stared at my hands, clean now, and still not clean.
 
Peace is a fragile skin on a rotting fruit.
 
 Three days later, the King went to the great Padmanabhaswamy temple. It was a private worship, or as private as a King's prayers can ever be. 
 
I commanded the escort. We stood at the outer perimeter of the *belikal* stones, the offering stones that ring the temple, watching the crowd that had gathered to see the royal party.
 
 The air smelled of camphor and crushed flowers. A line of temple elephants, darker than the night sky and draped in silks, swayed in the shade of the gopuram, their chains clinking with a lazy rhythm that underpinned the chanting.
 
 It happened in the space between two heartbeats.
 
 A man near the front of the crowd, dressed in the simple white mundu of a devotee, suddenly moved. He did not run; he flowed, like water finding a crack in a dam.
 
 A *chevar*. A suicide warrior who has accepted death before he even draws his blade. They come to their mission with *kanjav* or *bhang* in their blood, to dull fear and sharpen resolve into a single point. The coast has sung of chevars for generations, in ballads and kalari tales, so a man who chooses that path is already half legend before his blade clears his cloth.
 
 Ideally, my guards should have stopped him. But he was fast, and the crowd was thick.
 
 He cleared the line of spears in one leap. His target was not the King.
 
 It was the boy.
 
The Heir stood frozen, eyes wide, as the assassin's knife, a curved, nasty thing meant for gutting, flashed down.
 
 Marthanda Varma did not shout. He did not call for guards.
 
 He stepped in.
 
 He threw his own body across the boy's, turning his back to the blade.
 
 The knife did not find the boy's throat. It found the King's shoulder.
 
 I was moving by then, my sword already clearing leather. But the King was faster. Even as the blade bit into his flesh, he spun, ignoring the pain, and drove his heavy rings into the assassin's face.
 
 The man stumbled.
 
 A dozen spears took him before he hit the ground.
 
 The silence that followed was more terrible than the scream.
 
 The King stood swaying slightly, blood darkening the white silk of his angavastram. The boy clung to his leg, sobbing.
 
 “Highness!” Ramayyan was there in an instant, his face ashen.
 
 “I am fine,” Marthanda Varma rasped. He looked down at the dead assassin. “Check the boy.”
 
 “The Prince is unharmed,” Padmini's voice came from the crowd, sharp with relief. She pulled the nephew into her arms.
 
 We carried the King back to the palace. At the main gates, the royal elephants sensed the blood or the tension; they shifted restlessly in their stables, their low rumbles vibrating through the ground as we passed. We took him to the same room with the black floor and the ship-prow roof. Physicians came with pastes and bandages. The wound was deep but not mortal. The muscle had taken the fury of the blow.
 
 I used the time while they bound him to study the assassin's corpse.
 
 Ramayyan came in an hour later. He looked sick.
 
 “Well?” the King asked, his voice tight with pain.
 
 “A *chevar*,” Ramayyan said. “From the north.”
 
 “Who sent him?”
 
 “We found a mark on his dagger hilt,” Ramayyan said. “And gold in his waist pouch that speaks of Cochin mints. But the style... the hatred...”
 
 He hesitated.
 
 “Say it,” the King hissed.
 
 “Thampi,” Ramayyan whispered. “One of the sons who fled. The brothers are dead, but their hate breeds in exile.”
 
 Marthanda Varma closed his eyes.
 
 For a long moment, there was only the sound of the oil lamps sputtering.
 
 When he opened them, the cold amusement I had seen earlier was gone. In its place was something ancient and terrifying. “They struck at the child,” he said softly. “They did not come for me, a man who can fight. They came for the future.”
 
 “They are desperate, Highness,” Ramayyan said. “Exiles dreaming of old glories.”
 
 “Dreams are dangerous,” the King said. He sat up, pushing away the physician's restraining hand.
 
 “Listen to me, Dalawa. And you, Pillai.”
 
 We leaned in.
 
 “I want a squad,” he said. “Not soldiers. *Chevars* of our own. Or men who have forgotten how to sleep.”
 
 “To guard the Prince?” I asked.
 
 “No,” Marthanda Varma said. “To hunt.”
 
 He looked at the ceiling, where shadows danced on the carved timber.
 
 “Go north,” he said. “Find where these sons hide. Find their wives. Find their children. Find anyone who carries a drop of Thampi blood.”
 
 “Highness,” Ramayyan started, “the political fallout...”
 
 “There will be no politics,” the King said, his voice dropping to a whisper that chilled the room more than the night air. “Because there will be no one left to complain. I want them gone, Ramayyan. Root and branch. If a babe in arms carries that name, I want it silenced.”
 
 “But... just days ago, you spoke against butchery,” I ventured, the memory of his scolding fresh.
 
 He looked at me. His eyes were hard, flat surfaces, reflecting nothing but the intent to destroy.
 
 "That was war, Pillai," he said. "War has rules. Men fight for land, for coin, for duty. We respect that."
 
 He touched the bandage on his shoulder.
 
 “This?” he said. “This is not war. This is a weed trying to strangle my sapling. And for weeds, there is no treaty. There is only fire.”
 
 He lay back, his face pale but his jaw set like the stone of his fort.
 
 “Kill them all,” he said. “And when you are done, bring me the rings from their fingers so I know my nephew is safe.”
 
 I looked at Ramayyan. The Dalawa nodded, slowly, his face grim.
 
 We walked out into the corridor, where the black floor gleamed under our feet.
 
 “The Tiger has teeth,” Ramayyan murmured, echoing the King's earlier words.
 
 “And claws,” I said, feeling a chill that had nothing to do with the wind. “God help anyone who thinks they can clip them.”
