# Book I, Chapter 4: The Fishermen of the Pepper Coast

When the sea finally spat me out, it did so without ceremony.

Sand. My chest slammed into it so hard I thought my ribs had cracked. Salt water poured from my mouth, my nose, places I did not know could hold water. The retreating surf clawed at my legs, trying to pull me back. I dug my fingers into the coarse grit and held on.

Breathing was a battle. Each time I drew in air it brought more salt, more pain. My limbs felt like they belonged to someone else, a man made of lead and bruises. Somewhere in the confusion the rope around my chest had come free of the spar. Perhaps it had caught on something beneath the surface. Perhaps the storm gods had decided they wanted the wood more than they wanted me.

I lay there for a time that could have been minutes or hours, cheek pressed to wet sand, waves washing over my back and receding. At some point the noise in my ears shifted. The sea was no longer alone.

Voices.

They came first as a blur, rising and falling like the surf itself. Then words began to separate.

“...alive”

“Look at his hands...”

“Marata, see the brand on his arm.”

Hands rolled me onto my back. The sky spun. It was a flat, lowering grey, the colour of stale rice water. Rain had stopped, but clouds still hung heavy. Between my face and that sky were three other faces, framed by beards and damp hair.

They were not Portuguese.

These men wore lungis hitched up around their thighs and short, sleeveless vests that clung to their chests. Their skin was the brown of men who spent their lives in sun and salt. The smell that clung to them was strong and specific: fish, coconut oil, the faint sharpness of toddy.

One of them pushed my hair back from my forehead with rough fingers. I flinched out of habit more than fear.

"Easy, *bhau*," he said in Konkani, using the word for brother in that tongue, close enough to my Marathi that my bruised mind could follow. "You are on land now."

Land. The word tasted strange.

“Water,” I croaked.

A clay pot was pressed to my lips. The first swallow burned. The second soothed. The third brought my mind back enough that I could look past the men bending over me.

The beach stretched in a shallow curve, broken here and there by outcrops of black rock. Beyond it a line of coconut palms stood, their fronds rattling softly in the wind. The sea that had tried to keep me now rolled in long, heavy swells, its earlier fury spent.

On the sand to my right lay the broken carcass of a ship's boat, its planks scattered. Farther along the shore something larger loomed, half hidden by spray. I recognised the curve of a Portuguese hull, cracked open on an unseen reef. Bits of timber bobbed in the surf. No bodies, not that I could see.

Perhaps the sea had decided it had eaten enough men for one day.

“He has soldier's calluses,” one of the fishermen said, lifting my hand. The bandages the Portuguese had wrapped around my ruined fingers were soaked and filthy. “Look at this. Not a clerk. Not a merchant.”

"Look at this," another said, tugging at the ragged cloth on my shoulder. The Portuguese brand stood out beneath it, puckered and angry.

They spoke in quick, rolling Malayalam among themselves, a language I could not follow. Their gestures and the way their eyes moved over my wounds told their conclusion clearly enough: a fighter. A man who had been in Portuguese hands long enough to be burned.

"Kill him," a third voice said. It came from a little farther away, cautious. "Why bring trouble to the village? The Portuguese will send men when they hear of their ship. The Dutch will want to know what washed up in waters they claim. Better the sea finishes its work."

The man who had given me water snorted.

"The Portuguese and the Dutch ask questions anyway," he said. "You think leaving one marata on the sand will satisfy either of them? We might as well gain something."

“What?” the cautious voice demanded. “He is half dead.”

“Half is still half,” the first man replied. He turned back to me and switched to a broken Hindustani that bore the marks of trade. “You fought them, yes?”

“Yes,” I said. My voice rasped. “On the Deccan roads. Near their forts.”

He nodded, as if that confirmed a calculation.

“Our king to the south fights them too,” he said. “And the other pale ones from the north, the Dutch. He sharpens his teeth for them. A man who has seen Portuguese dungeons and still breathes may be useful.”

King. Teeth. Dutch. The words caught like hooks in my exhausted mind.

"Travancore," I said slowly.

The fisherman raised his brows. “You know the name.”

“I know they have not yet learned to kneel when a foreign flag flies,” I said. “That is enough.”

He grinned. His teeth were surprisingly white against his weathered skin.

“You see, he has a tongue as well as scars. Come, *bhau*. Before the crabs claim you.”

They lifted me with practised ease, one man taking my shoulders, another my legs. The third walked ahead, scanning the shore. My body protested every movement. Muscles pulled at wounds. My head swam. Yet underneath the pain there was something else.

Sand grit against my bare heels. The rustle of palm fronds. The smell of earth instead of salt.

After the dungeon and the storm, these small things felt like gifts.

We left the wreckage behind. No one stopped to strip it. That would come later, when the sea had finished gnawing and the Portuguese had decided what could be salvaged. For now the fishermen moved with the quick, furtive caution of men who did not want to be seen near a crime they had not committed.

A crow cawed somewhere ahead, indignant at our approach. The first solid ground I had felt in weeks pressed against my back with each step the fishermen took.

Beyond the line of palms the land rose gently. Narrow paths wound between plots of wet paddy and neat little houses made of mud and laterite, their roofs thatched with palm leaves. The air smelled different here. Less of fish, more of earth and green things.

Children watched us from doorways, wide eyed. Women carrying pots on their hips paused, eyebrows knitting as they took in the dripping figure the men carried.

"Portuguese," one girl whispered.

“No,” the man at my feet said sharply. “Look at his eyes. Look at his mark. This one is enemy of the Portuguese.”

We stopped at a low house near the edge of the village. A woman with streaks of grey in her hair stepped out, wiping her hands on her sari. A betel-stained smile flickered at the corner of her mouth as she took in the dripping figure, then vanished. The fishermen spoke to her rapidly in Malayalam. She listened without interrupting, eyes flicking over me, taking in the branded arm, the bandaged hands, the raw rope marks on my chest.

"Bring him in," she said at last. Her voice had the calm authority of someone used to making decisions that stuck. "If he dies, burn him quietly. Else send word to the *kapitan*."

The *kapitan*. A local headman, or something more? The word carried more weight here than it ever had in the inland markets where I had first heard it.

Inside the house it was cool and dim. The floor was packed earth, swept smooth. Smoke from a small hearth curled up toward a hole in the roof. They laid me on a woven mat and set about stripping off the salt stiffened rags that clung to me.

The first touch of clean water on my skin made me hiss. The woman's hands were brisk, not gentle, but she avoided the worst of the wounds. When she saw the state of my fingers her mouth tightened. She said something in Malayalam, her tone sharp with disgust.

The fisherman who spoke Konkani translated. "She asks what they did to you."

"Asked questions," I said.

He translated. She clicked her tongue and replied in a quick burst of Malayalam.

"She says keep your stories for the kapitan," the fisherman said. "She does not need to hear them to know what kind of men they are."

A boy appeared at the doorway, panting, and spoke rapidly in Malayalam. The fishermen exchanged glances. From the word "kapitan" and the urgency in the boy's voice, I understood enough.

So. I was not the first piece of foreign wreckage to wash up in their nets.

The Konkani-speaking fisherman adjusted the cloth on his shoulder and turned to me.

"Rest," he said. "When the *kapitan* comes, speak carefully. He works for men who have long arms."

I closed my eyes for a moment, not to sleep but to gather what little strength I had left. Storms on land were different from storms at sea. They did not roar and crash; they crept in on quiet feet, through conversations and calculations.

I had escaped the Portuguese dungeon and the drowning ship by chance and stubbornness. If I was to survive whatever came next, I would need more than that.

Footsteps sounded outside, firm and quick. A new voice spoke in Malayalam, low but carrying. The fishermen answered with words laced with respect.

When the man they called *kapitan* stepped into the house, the smell of salt and foreign places came with him. He was shorter than the fishermen but broader, with a scar that ran from his left ear to the corner of his jaw, the kind of scar a blade leaves when it just misses the throat.

His eyes moved over me the way a horse trader's eyes move over new stock. He noted the brand, the bandaged hands, the way I held myself despite the wounds. I had seen that look before, in market squares where men were sold. For a long moment he said nothing, and in that silence I felt myself being weighed.
