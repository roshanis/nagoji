# Author's Historical Note: Blood and Thrones

This novel is fiction built on a real landscape.

**Marthanda Varma and Travancore**

Marthanda Varma (r. 1729–1758) was a historical ruler of Travancore in what is now Kerala. He expanded a relatively small kingdom into a significant regional power, broke several older local houses that opposed him, and used a mixture of military reform, temple patronage and fiscal centralisation to tighten control over the coast and its pepper trade.

The novel leans on that broad arc but invents much of the interior life and many specific scenes. The conversations with Nagoji, the temple attack by a chevar, and the exact form of his councils are imagined, though they echo the violence and political risk recorded in contemporary and later sources.

**Colachel and De Lannoy**

The Battle of Colachel in 1741 was real and important. A Travancore force under Marthanda Varma defeated a Dutch East India Company expedition, one of the first times an Indian state decisively broke a European company in open battle on the Indian coast.

Eustachius De Lannoy was a historical Dutch officer captured at Colachel who entered Travancore service and helped modernise its forts and infantry. The star influenced bastions, angled walls and low, thick ramparts described in the novel draw on real sites such as Udayagiri Fort and Vattakottai, though their construction is compressed and dramatised. De Lannoy’s relationship with Nagoji, his internal conflicts and dialogue are fictional.

**Ramayyan and court politics**

Ramayyan Dalawa was a real diwan of Travancore and a key adviser to Marthanda Varma. Contemporary and later accounts present him as an able, often ruthless administrator. His “ledger room,” his habit of recording personal dossiers and the specific tests he sets for Nagoji are inventions, meant to embody the kind of hard political memory that a small besieged state needed to survive.

The tensions between the crown and older local houses are grounded in the historical struggle between Marthanda Varma and the Ettuveettil Pillamar and other chiefs, but characters like Kollamkara are composites rather than portraits of a single person.

**Women, Velinadu and matriliny**

Travancore and several real houses on its fringes had strong matrilineal traditions in this period. Land, titles and authority in many Nair and royal lines ran through women, who could hold estates, sign agreements and shape succession.

The novel's *Velinadu Kovilakam* is invented, though it is inspired by the documented independence of certain coastal matrilineal houses that dealt directly with European companies and defended their rights with both paper and steel. Padmini Amma and Revathi Bayi are fictional, but their roles and attitudes are shaped by this wider matrilineal context. Their words, loves and choices are imagined but meant to honour that historical autonomy.

**Nagoji Sawant and the Marathas**

Nagoji Sawant, his family near Nashik, his capture in Goa and his entire first person narrative are invented. There were Maratha raids against Portuguese and other European positions on the west coast, and Maratha horsemen did move through Goa and the Konkan, but this particular officer never existed.

His letters from the Deccan, the hints of Peshwa interest in Travancore and the tension between confederacy ambitions and southern small state survival mirror real eighteenth century dynamics. Timelines and relationships are simplified and filtered through his limited, biased perspective.

**Chevars, kalari and battle detail**

The chevar assassination attempt at the temple is fictional but draws on South Indian traditions of sworn suicide warriors and on the real violence Marthanda Varma faced from displaced houses. The kalari training pits, weapons and hand to hand fighting techniques are informed by Keralan martial traditions, but described with some licence for narrative clarity.

Weapons, armour and tactics are based on period appropriate sources: matchlocks, flintlocks, talwars, small field cannon, and emerging “European drill” coexisting with older styles. Reload times, effective ranges and the impact of wet sand, smoke and close quarters combat are treated as seriously as the story allows, without claiming technical perfection.

**What is compressed or shifted**

Chronology has been tightened. Real campaigns, fort projects and diplomatic exchanges that in reality unfolded over many years are compressed into fewer scenes so that the narrative has shape and momentum. Some real places are renamed or combined, and some invented estates and forts are placed in plausible but fictional locations to give characters room to move.

The novel is written from inside Nagoji's head. He does not know everything a historian might know. He misreads motives, misses distant developments and interprets events through his own loyalties and fears. Where his account clashes with documentary history, the history wins; where the sources are silent, imagination has filled the gaps within what seems period plausible.

**Elayadathu Swaroopam and Kottarakkara**

The absorption of Kottarakkara and the fate of the Elayadathu Swaroopam's ruling line are based on historical events. Around 1739–1740, Travancore moved against this house. The chief of Kottarakkara did die in confinement at Trivandrum. A senior woman of the Elayadathu line did claim succession under matrilineal law, was refused recognition by Marthanda Varma, fled to Thekkumkur, was briefly reinstalled by the Dutch, and eventually surrendered and took asylum in Cochin.

Local Kottarakkara history remembers her only as "the princess of Elayadathu Swaroopam" or "the last queen of this dynasty." This novel gives her the name Savitri and imagines her relationship to Revathi Bayi and her garden exile in Cochin. The core facts, that a legitimate claimant was refused and exiled, are historical.

**Trippadidaanam: Surrendering the Kingdom to God**

Marthanda Varma's act of dedicating his kingdom to Lord Padmanabha, declaring himself merely "Padmanabha Dasa" (Servant of Padmanabha), is historical. This *trippadidaanam* transformed the king from sovereign to divine steward and made Travancore theoretically the property of a god.

The novel treats this as both sincere devotion and shrewd statecraft. Contemporaries and later historians have debated how much was faith and how much was political genius, making the kingdom untouchable by earthly claimants. This ambiguity is preserved in the narrative.

Readers interested in the real Travancore, Marthanda Varma, De Lannoy and the Dutch on the Malabar coast are encouraged to consult modern scholarly work and to visit surviving forts and temples. This book is not a textbook. It is a story about how a small kingdom learned to ride out storms, told by a man who might have stood in their spray.
