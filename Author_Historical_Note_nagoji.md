# Author's Historical Note: Blood and Thrones

This novel is fiction built on a real landscape.

**Marthanda Varma and Travancore**

Marthanda Varma (r. 1729–1758) was a historical ruler of Travancore in what is now Kerala. He expanded a relatively small kingdom into a significant regional power, broke several older local houses that opposed him, and used a mixture of military reform, temple patronage and fiscal centralisation to tighten control over the coast and its pepper trade.

The novel leans on that broad arc but invents much of the interior life and many specific scenes. The conversations with Nagoji, the temple attack by a chevar, and the exact form of his councils are imagined, though they echo the violence and political risk recorded in contemporary and later sources.

**Colachel and De Lannoy**

The Battle of Colachel in 1741 was real and important. A Travancore force under Marthanda Varma defeated a Dutch East India Company expedition, one of the first times an Indian state decisively broke a European company in open battle on the Indian coast.

Eustachius De Lannoy was a historical Dutch officer captured at Colachel who entered Travancore service and helped modernise its forts and infantry. The star influenced bastions, angled walls and low, thick ramparts described in the novel draw on real sites such as Udayagiri Fort and Vattakottai, though their construction is compressed and dramatised. De Lannoy’s relationship with Nagoji, his internal conflicts and dialogue are fictional.

**Ramayyan and court politics**

Ramayyan Dalawa was a real diwan of Travancore and a key adviser to Marthanda Varma. Contemporary and later accounts present him as an able, often ruthless administrator. His “ledger room,” his habit of recording personal dossiers and the specific tests he sets for Nagoji are inventions, meant to embody the kind of hard political memory that a small besieged state needed to survive.

The tensions between the crown and older local houses are grounded in the historical “Years of Consolidation” (1735–1740) where Marthanda Varma systematically broke the *Ettuveetil Pillamar* and other chiefs. Nagoji arrives in 1738, in the later phase of that consolidation, and the novel dramatizes these police actions and internal wars as the crucible where he earns trust before the Dutch threat arrives. Characters like Kollamkara are composites rather than portraits of a single person.

**Women, Velinadu and matriliny**

Travancore and several real houses on its fringes had strong matrilineal traditions in this period. Land, titles and authority in many Nair and royal lines ran through women, who could hold estates, sign agreements and shape succession.

The novel's *Velinadu Kovilakam* is invented, though it is inspired by the documented independence of certain coastal matrilineal houses that dealt directly with European companies and defended their rights with both paper and steel. Padmini Amma and Revathi Bayi are fictional, but their roles and attitudes are shaped by this wider matrilineal context. Their words, loves and choices are imagined but meant to honour that historical autonomy.

**Nagoji Sawant and the Marathas**

Nagoji Sawant, his family near Nashik, his capture in Goa and his entire first person narrative are invented. There were Maratha raids against Portuguese and other European positions on the west coast, and Maratha horsemen did move through Goa and the Konkan, but this particular officer never existed.

His letters from the Deccan, the hints of Peshwa interest in Travancore and the tension between confederacy ambitions and southern small state survival mirror real eighteenth century dynamics. Timelines and relationships are simplified and filtered through his limited, biased perspective.

**Chevars, kalari and battle detail**

The chevar assassination attempt at the temple is fictional but draws on South Indian traditions of sworn suicide warriors and on the real violence Marthanda Varma faced from displaced houses. The kalari training pits, weapons and hand to hand fighting techniques are informed by Keralan martial traditions, but described with some licence for narrative clarity.

Weapons, armour and tactics are based on period appropriate sources: matchlocks, flintlocks, talwars, small field cannon, and emerging “European drill” coexisting with older styles. Reload times, effective ranges and the impact of wet sand, smoke and close quarters combat are treated as seriously as the story allows, without claiming technical perfection.

**What is compressed or shifted**

Chronology has been tightened. Real campaigns, fort projects and diplomatic exchanges that in reality unfolded over many years are compressed into fewer scenes so that the narrative has shape and momentum. Some real places are renamed or combined, and some invented estates and forts are placed in plausible but fictional locations to give characters room to move.

The novel is written from inside Nagoji's head. He does not know everything a historian might know. He misreads motives, misses distant developments and interprets events through his own loyalties and fears. Where his account clashes with documentary history, the history wins; where the sources are silent, imagination has filled the gaps within what seems period plausible.

**Kottarakkara, Elayadathu, and the northern houses**

Elayadathu Swaroopam (Kottarakkara) and the northern principalities of Thekkumkur and Vadakkumkur were real flashpoints in Travancore's expansion. In documentary history, Dutch policy in 1739–1741 intersects with the Elayadathu grievance, while the annexations of Thekkumkur and Vadakkumkur occur later. The novel compresses and braids these threads, using Savitri of Kottarakkara as a single character through whom the broader matrilineal succession dispute can be felt at the human scale.

**Treaty of Mavelikkara (1753)**

The decisive treaty where the Dutch agreed to “reciprocate friendship” and withdraw support from local princes is known as the Treaty of Mavelikkara (1753). In the novel, the initial “bowing” of the Dutch (Chapter 18) represents earlier truces (like the Treaty of Mannar, 1743), while the final capitulation is referenced in Book IV as the ultimate consequence of the northern victories.

**Assassination attempts and the Ettuveetil Pillamar**

Marthanda Varma faced repeated assassination attempts throughout his reign, particularly from the Ettuveetil Pillamar (Lords of the Eight Houses), powerful nobles who had controlled much of Travancore's land and revenue before his centralising reforms stripped their authority. Historical sources record attempts including bowmen on palace walls, poisoned lamp oil in temple sanctums, and knives in festival crowds. The novel's chevar scene and Ramayyan's references to “three serious attempts” draw on this documented pattern of violence.

The *chevar* tradition, sworn warriors who took oaths to kill or die trying, was real in parts of South India. Though the specific attack in the novel is invented, such men were employed by aggrieved houses against rulers they considered usurpers. That Marthanda Varma survived these attempts and went on to break the Eight Houses entirely shaped his reputation as both ruthless and divinely protected.

**Thrippadidanam and the Padmanabhaswamy Temple**

Marthanda Varma's act of dedicating his kingdom to Lord Padmanabha, declaring himself merely “Padmanabha Dasa” (Servant of Padmanabha), is historical. This *Thrippadidanam* transformed the king from sovereign to divine steward and made Travancore theoretically the property of a god.

The novel treats this as both sincere devotion and shrewd statecraft. Contemporaries and later historians have debated how much was faith and how much was political genius, making the kingdom untouchable by earthly claimants. This ambiguity is preserved in the narrative.

The Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram was rebuilt as the monumental structure we see today under Marthanda Varma. The main Vishnu idol, largely destroyed in a fire during his predecessor Rama Varma's reign, was reconstructed. He created the Ottakkal Mandapam and the Sheevelippura, and completed five of the temple gopura's seven floors. New state ceremonies, including Murajapam and Bhadra Deepam, were introduced during his reign.

The connection between survival and sacred architecture runs through the novel: a king who had poison planted in temple oil went on to rebuild that same temple as a statement that neither assassins nor fire could stop what he was building. The *Thrippadidanam* was the final move, giving to god what men had tried to take by steel.

**Thiruvananthapuram and cultural patronage**

Thiruvananthapuram became a prominent city in Kerala under Marthanda Varma. As neighbouring chiefdoms were absorbed, artists and scholars from these places migrated to the capital, transforming it into a cultural centre. Marthanda Varma gave patronage to temple art forms including Koothu, Padhakam, Kathakali, Thullal and Koodiyattam. This cultural flowering, built partly on the displacement of older houses, adds another layer to the novel's central tension between state building and human cost.

Readers interested in the real Travancore, Marthanda Varma, De Lannoy and the Dutch on the Malabar coast are encouraged to consult modern scholarly work and to visit surviving forts and temples. This book is not a textbook. It is a story about how a small kingdom learned to ride out storms, told by a man who might have stood in their spray.
