# Book III, Chapter 14: The Charge at Colachel

At first light the sea was still.

Not calm. Never calm on this coast. The swell still rolled in, grey on grey under a sky the colour of wet steel, but it did so with a deceptive regularity that made me almost forget how quickly it could change.

Men do the same before battle.

They move with the dull efficiency of habit. They chew dry rice and fish because someone pushes a leaf into their hands. They piss behind bushes. They adjust straps and check knots. Their hands shake a little more than on ordinary mornings, but the rhythm of preparation carries them forward.

It was like that at Colachel.

The Dutch had chosen their landing well.

The beach curved in a shallow crescent, backed by dunes and scrub, with a small cluster of huts at one end and a low rise leading toward the inland road. To their right the land jutted into the sea in a rocky headland. To their left, coconut groves thickened into heavier growth.

Their ships lay off the coast, anchors down, hulls turning slowly with the swell. Boats had come and gone most of the night, bringing men, powder, barrels, pigs, crates, all the clutter of an army that believed it would establish a camp and from there extend order inland.

They had the look of men who had done this many times before in many other places.

Blocks of infantry in blue and grey, belts crossed on their chests, hats pulled low. Drummers with sticks already taped, hands twitching. Officers with swords and sticks, pacing the lines. A few small cannon dragged into place by sweating men, their wheels sinking into the sand, their muzzles pointed roughly toward where they expected annoyance to appear.

Behind them, on a slight rise, stood their commander.

Lannoy.

I had only ever seen him as a distant shape on a ship. Now, from my vantage point behind a low dune to the west, I could make out more detail.

Tall, with broad shoulders. Hair pulled back and tied, pale against his neck. Coat unadorned by the ridiculous lace some other Europeans favoured, but cut well. Hands behind his back at first, then resting lightly on the hilt of his sword as he gave an order and an aide trotted off.

He moved like a man used to his body obeying him, and to other men doing the same.

“He looks like he thinks the sand belongs to him,” Kulkarni muttered beside me.

“For the moment he thinks it does,” I said. “Our task is to take that belief away.”

Our own men were already in place.

Travancore musketeers lay in shallow pits and behind hastily raised breastworks along the edge of the coconut grove that curved to the Dutch left. Their matchcords glowed faintly, tiny orange stars in the half light. Small cannon sat hidden behind woven screens of palm leaves, their crews hunkered down, waiting.

Farther inland, near the low rise, Nair footsoldiers stood in looser formation, shields and spears ready. They were the web that would catch whatever broke through.

My horsemen waited behind a line of scrub and low dunes, out of direct sight.

Arcot riders on the right, Raza Khan at their head, lances upright for now. Nair horsemen on the left, Kumaran with his lighter mounts. Between them, a smaller core of men who had ridden with me in the Deccan, their bodies already tuned to the feel of my signals.

We had spoken through the night, not in some grand council, but in small knots, going over what each group was to do.

“They will expect a frontal charge,” I had said, tracing lines in the sand with a stick. “They will hope for it. They have drilled for it. So we do not give it to them.”

Instead, we would give them smoke and confusion.

First, the musketeers and guns would treat them as they had treated so many others, with volleys into crowded ranks. Then, when they dressed their lines and prepared for the expected rush, we would come, not from the place their officers pointed at, but from where their eyes were not yet fixed.

Easier said than done, with wet sand and inland scrub and the unpredictability of battle.

The first Dutch cannon fired as the sun finally broke the line of the sea.

It was more a gesture than an attack, a single round shot flung inland to show the men behind it that they were at war now. The ball whistled over the coconut grove and thudded harmlessly into a patch of scrub. A few birds exploded up from the trees, offended.

Then the drums started.

That sound carries oddly over sand.

Slow at first, then quicker as the Dutch infantry formed their lines. The beat set their feet in motion, forward in unison toward the edge of the prepared ground, toward where they believed our main resistance would sit.

They did not know about the pits.

When they came within the range Ramayyan had marked on his map, a conch blew from somewhere in the grove. A matchlock snapped to the pan. A tiny cascade of sparks fell.

Then the first volley roared.

Our muskets spat fire from the green edge, a ragged sheet of flame that lit the lower fronds and filled the air with a sudden cloud of white smoke. Men in the front Dutch rank jerked and fell, some backward, some forward. A gap opened.

For a heartbeat the line wavered.

Then the officers shouted, sticks cracking on shoulders, swords gesturing. The second rank stepped over the fallen and returned fire.

Their volley was tighter, well drilled. Balls tore into the grove, kicked up sand, smashed into tree trunks. A scream rose from somewhere in our pits.

The dance had begun.

For a few long minutes the exchange continued.

Volley, smoke, reload, shout, another volley. Our cannon behind the palm screens answered theirs, the balls ploughing into their ranks with thuds that I felt in my chest even from the flank.

The Dutch line, though bloodied, did not break. They edged forward, a slow, grinding advance, firing, stepping, filling gaps.

Lannoy stood on his rise, watching through a glass. I saw him gesture, saw the way his aide galloped to one side, sending a detachment of men toward the thicker scrub to try to flank our pits.

He was not a fool.

“Wait,” I murmured to my riders as the urge to move built in their bodies. “Wait.”

The wind had picked up. Smoke from both sides rolled along the sand in low banks, sometimes hiding the Dutch, sometimes us. The smell of saltpetre, damp earth and the metallic tang of blood mixed into a single heavy taste at the back of the throat.

Shots cracked. Men shouted orders in languages that tangled on the air. Somewhere a horse screamed, high and long, a sound that always cuts deeper than a man's shout.

“Now,” I said.

Not a roar. No need. The men nearest me picked it up, passed it along with hand signals and gestures. We had drilled for this: moving when the smoke was thickest, when eyes were stinging and ears were ringing.

We split.

Arcot horse swung wide to the right, aiming at the Dutch left where the sand near the water's edge gave firmer footing. Nair horse went left, cutting inland through scrub that taller European horses would hesitate to enter. My smaller core rode with the Arcot men for the first pass.

We moved at a trot at first, then a canter, feeling the ground with every stride.

The wet sand pulled, as always, but our horses knew it now. They adjusted their legs without panicking, trusting our hands.

We came around the edge of the smoke bank like a wave.

For a moment the Dutch saw us as if framed in a painting.

Arcot turbans bright against the grey morning. Lances lowering. Horses' manes whipping. Behind them, the hint of Nair riders moving through the scrub on the far side.

Their line tried to turn.

That was the moment I had waited for.

Men drilled to fire straight ahead do not like having to bend. Officers shouted, waving their sticks, trying to peel sections of the line toward us. The squares they had begun to form loosened.

“Do not hit them head on,” I shouted. “Skim them. Cut the edge.”

We angled in toward the leftmost company.

Muskets fired, some too early, some too late. Smoke bloomed. I felt the hot hiss of a ball pass my leg, heard a man behind me grunt and fall. A horse went down in front, its legs folding as if they belonged to someone else.

We did not slow.

Our lances struck their outermost men, not in a neat, crushing impact, but in a series of sharp jabs that tore at the skin of their formation. A man spun away, impaled. Another threw up his arms and dropped his musket. A third fell under a horse's hooves, disappearing from my sight in a flail of limbs and sand.

We did not stay to hack and tangle.

“Pull,” I shouted, and the first wave veered away, hooves churning up sand, bodies leaning with the turn.

Behind us, Nair riders hit the other flank.

Their charge was less formal than the Arcot men's, more of a surge. They came out of the scrub with a kind of joyous ferocity, swords and spears flashing. Their horses darted in and out, striking where they saw openings, then vanishing.

The Dutch line, already adjusting to our first touch, now had to twist in two directions at once.

They were not unskilled. I must give them that. They tried to form a hedgehog, bayonets out on all sides, officers bellowing, drums beating desperately to hold some pattern together.

But the sand betrayed them.

Men who tried to pivot quickly found their boots sunk deeper than expected. A man turning to face a new threat stumbled over the body of a comrade he had not realised was there. A cannon crew, attempting to drag their piece around to fire at our horse, found their wheels sinking, their shoulders straining against an unyielding suction.

Our musketeers in the pits did not remain idle.

Seeing the confusion, they fired again, not in neat volleys this time, but in ragged, opportunistic shots that picked at gaps in the Dutch formation.

The sound became a roar without edges.

“Again,” I shouted.

We wheeled wide and came in once more, this time aiming for the companies that had held back in reserve, those farther from the first exchange. Their officers, still trying to understand what was happening at the front, turned too late.

One Arcot lancer took a bayonet in the thigh and went down with a howl, his horse stumbling over him. Another rider's lance snapped, leaving him with a useless shaft in his hand. Kumaran's horse leapt over a fallen Dutchman and planted a hoof squarely on the man's chest. The crack was lost in the larger noise.

Through it all, a part of my mind, the part that had counted guards in Goa and waves on the Arabian Sea, kept tally.

How many of ours fell. How many of theirs did. How many horses limped. How many men still moved with purpose and how many were already just bodies waiting for flies.

Somewhere in the smoke, I glimpsed Lannoy closer.

Not the distant figure on the rise now, but a man on horseback nearer the front, shouting in a language I did not understand. His face was set, not with fear, but with a cold focus. He rode along the line, trying to steady it, sword in hand, pushing men back into place.

Our eyes met for the briefest moment.

He saw a dark skinned rider on a local horse, turban damp with sweat, blade red at the edge. I saw a pale haired officer whose neat drill was being dragged into sand and blood.

Then smoke swallowed him again.

The battle stretched.

Time in such moments is not counted in minutes. It is counted in volleys, in charges, in the number of times you notice your sword arm tiring and force it to lift again.

At some point, a rumble at the edge of hearing resolved into the sound of more feet.

Nair infantry, pushing forward from their inland position, shields up, spears ready. They had waited until the Dutch line had become sufficiently frayed, then moved in.

“Do not let them form square,” one of their captains shouted in Malayalam, a phrase I had taught him in my own tongue and he had translated into his. “Keep them turning.”

We did.

Horse and foot, muskets and spears, we kept the Dutch from fixing their gaze in one direction long enough to turn their training against them.

When the turning point came, it was almost quiet.

Not silent. The roar of battle does not just vanish. But there was a moment when the noise changed key.

Men stopped shouting orders and began shouting only for themselves. Drums faltered. The lines that had tried so hard to stay straight sagged inward.

A Dutch standard, its colours muddied with smoke and dust, dipped, then fell. For a heartbeat, no one picked it up.

“Now,” I breathed, though there was no one near enough to hear.

Our foot pressed. Our riders struck one more time, not with the sharp, probing jabs of earlier, but with a more sustained push, swords swinging, lances thrusting at men whose arms finally felt the weight of their own muskets.

The line buckled.

Then it broke.

From my saddle I saw it ripple, like cloth tearing.

Men turned away from the enemy instead of toward him. Some dropped weapons and ran toward the boats. Others backed slowly, still firing, but with the wary movements of men who have lost the invisible protection of discipline.

Lannoy tried to rally them.

He rode into the gap, sword raised, shouting, his face flushed. A few men gathered around him, forming a small knot of resistance as the larger shape disintegrated. They fired in controlled volleys, stepping back as they did, trying to buy time for others to escape.

“Leave that knot,” I shouted to the nearest riders. “Let the foot deal with it. Take the ones running.”

Merciless Perhaps. Necessary, certainly.

Men who run become the seeds of future companies. Men who stand and die become stories, and stories, for all their danger, cannot fire muskets.

We chased the fleeing Dutch toward the water's edge.

Some reached the boats, flinging themselves in, pushing others away. A few boats capsized under the weight of too many bodies. Men splashed in the surf, flailing, weighed down by soaked coats and belts.

I saw a Dutch officer push a common soldier aside to claim a place in a skiff. The man he shoved away disappeared under the water. The officer did not look back.

Our men did not pursue into the waves. Horses balk at deeper water, and Ramayyan had forbidden us to risk them that way.

“Let the sea take its share,” he had said. “We will have enough dead on land to count.”

So we stayed on the edge, swords in hand, watching as some men escaped, some drowned, some dropped to their knees in the surf with hands raised.

Behind us, the knot around Lannoy finally crumpled.

I turned in time to see him go down, not from a sword blow, but as his horse stumbled in a patch of blood slicked sand and fell. He rolled clear with the reflexes of a trained rider, came up on one knee, sword still in his hand.

Nair spears ringed him.

For a moment, it looked as if he would fight to the last. His jaw set. His grip tightened.

Then he saw something, perhaps the size of the ring around him, perhaps the bodies at his feet, perhaps the angle of the muskets that had him covered. He took a breath, looked toward the fort on the bluff, and slowly lowered his sword.

He held it out, hilt first.

The Nair captain nearest him hesitated, then took it.

Lannoy bowed his head, just a fraction.

That was how the Dutch square at Colachel broke.

Not with a single heroic stroke, not with a dramatic rout, but with a series of small failures of discipline under the weight of sand, smoke, and men who refused to charge where they were expected to.

After the last shots faded, the sounds that came next were always the same, in any language, in any battle.

Groans. Short, sharp cries as men discovered wounds now that the heat of the fight no longer numbed them. The mutter of orders, softer now. The wet, slap and suck of men moving through blood tinged sand.

I swung down from my horse.

The world at ground level looked different.

Bodies lay at odd angles, as if dropped from a careless height. Dutch coats stained dark. White mundus soaked red. Horses with glassy eyes, legs twisted. Broken muskets. Scattered hats. A single drum, split open, its skin torn, lying beside its bearer.

Our men moved among them, some binding wounds, some finishing moans with a quick thrust. A few bent to strip belts and boots, habits learned from thin years and hard campaigns.

“Leave their coats,” I said to one young soldier who had started to tug at a Dutch jacket. “Those colours are a curse. Take powder, shot, boots, yes. Leave the cloth. We have our own.”

He nodded, a little shame faced.

“Yes, sahib.”

I walked on.

Near the place where Lannoy had surrendered, I found him sitting on a piece of driftwood, hands bound loosely in front of him with a strip of cloth.

Without his sword and his horse he looked less like a force of nature and more like what he was: a man, tired and bruised, his hair damp with sweat, a cut on his forehead seeping blood down the side of his face.

He looked up as I approached.

Our eyes met again, this time without smoke between us.

“You ride well,” he said in halting Hindustani, surprising me. His accent made the words stiff, but they were clear enough.

“You drill well,” I said.

He gave a short, humourless huff that might have been a laugh.

“Today, it was not enough,” he said.

I thought of Goa, of chains, of interrogations. I thought of how easy it would be to kick sand in his face, to spit, to call him butcher or tyrant or any of the names men like him had earned elsewhere.

Instead, I said only, “War is a poor teacher. It gives its lessons after the exam.”

He frowned, not understanding.

“The Maharaja will want to speak with you,” I said. “He enjoys talking to men who think the ground belongs to them.”

“You think it belongs to you?” he asked.

“No,” I said. “That is why I am still standing.”

He studied me for a heartbeat more, then looked away, out toward the sea where his ships swung at anchor, too far to help.

Behind me, a conch sounded, low and long.

Our signal.

The battle at Colachel was done.

The war that would follow had only just begun.
