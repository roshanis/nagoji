# Book III, Chapter 14: The Siege of Colachel

The war became a weight, not a collision.

There was no grand morning charge, no thunder of hooves on wet sand as I had once imagined in my restless sleep. Instead, there was the slow, grinding work of earth and patience.

For weeks, we pinned them against the sea.

Our lines curved around their beachhead like a tightening noose. We dug trenches in the sandy soil, reinforcing them with palm trunks and woven mats. We raised batteries of cannon that pounded their impromptu stockade day and night. We watched them through the haze of heat and salt spray, a blue and grey mass of men shrinking into an ever smaller patch of ground.

“They are stubborn,” Dhanaji muttered one morning, wiping sweat from his eyes as we watched a fresh plume of smoke rise from their camp. “Most men would have swum for the ships by now.”

“They are waiting for help that isn't coming,” I said. “And they are afraid to admit that the great Dutch East India Company has been trapped by a king they thought was a petty chieftain.”

Strategy had shifted, just as Varma had promised.

My riders did not charge squares. We became the gaolers of the perimeter. Ponnam Pandya Deven’s Maravar horse wove through scrub and low palms, closing gaps my Deccan eyes might have missed, while Arcot and Maratha riders watched the wider tracks.

We patrolled the scrub inland, catching the desperate few who tried to slip out to forage for food. We rode down their scouts. We cut off the trickle of fresh water from the inland streams.

But the true strangeness of this war was that it had two fronts: the land where we stood, and the sea where the fishermen ruled.

Late one night, I went down to the water’s edge, away from our main batteries.

The moon was hidden behind monsoon clouds. The sea was a black, heaving mass. It should have been empty; no sane man sailed these waters in the dark during the rains.

But it was alive.

Shadows moved on the surf. Low, narrow boats, blackened with soot, slipped through the waves with barely a splash. The Mukkuvar men, their bodies oiled to slip through water and grip alike, were going to work.

I watched as a group of them returned, dragging their craft up the sand. They were grinning, their teeth white in the gloom.

“Good fishing?” I asked one of the headmen, a scarred man named Antony.

He spat a stream of betel juice into the sand.

“Very good, Ayya,” he said. “We found a supply boat trying to come in from a ship further out. It has a hole in its bottom now. The rice is for the fish.”

“And the crew?”

“Some swam,” he said with a shrug. “The sea is hungry tonight.”

He gestured to the dark water.

“They do not understand,” he said. “They think big ships make them masters. But big ships must anchor. And anchors act like tethers for goats. We swim out, we cut, we drill. They are fighting the ocean, and the ocean is on our side.”

It was a terrifying efficient alliance. On land, Ramayyan’s batteries hammered their walls. At sea, Antony’s divers and boatmen bled their supplies and nerves. The Dutch were trapped in a box where the walls were fire and the floor was water.

Before we pinned them here, their mud ramparts had already sagged under the weight of their own guns, and an early storm had torn some of their anchors away. Hackert, the commander they had trusted to lead them, had gone north with fresh troops, leaving Lieutenant Rijtel to hold this shrinking patch of sand with sick men and empty barrels.

Yet, they held.

Lannoy kept them disciplined. Even from a distance, I could see him, or a figure I assumed was him, walking the perimeter of their shrinking fort. He moved men to plug gaps. He rationed their dwindling food. He kept their muskets firing, though the volleys grew more ragged as powder ran low.

“He is a good officer,” Ramayyan admitted one evening, looking over the casualty reports. “A waste of a man, serving a ledger.”

“He thinks he is serving his nation,” Varma said. The king sat on a camp stool, sharpening a small knife, his eyes on the distant Dutch fires.

“He serves a company,” Ramayyan corrected. “Merchants who will check the cost of his rescue against the price of pepper and decide he is too expensive.”

The end, when it came, arrived on a wind from the sea.

It was the 5th of August. The sun had broken through the clouds, baking the wet sand until the air shimmered. The smell of the siege, unburied waste, rotting fish, burnt powder, hung heavy over everything.

Our batteries had been firing sluggishly all morning. The heat made the gunners slow.

I thought of Karl August's charcoal marks on Ramayyan's leaf, the little shaded square he had drawn where powder and rice lay too close together for anyone's comfort.

“Wake them up,” I told a Nair captain. “If the Dutch think we are sleeping, they might try a sortie.”

He shouted an order. A crew on the main battery, nearest the beach, sponged their piece and rammed a charge home. They adjusted the elevation, squinting against the glare, aligning the barrel by habit toward the heart of the fort where Ramayyan had quietly told them the enemy kept its teeth.

I do not believe in luck. I believe in preparation meeting opportunity. But sometimes, war throws dice.

The gun fired. A puff of white smoke, a dull thud.

We watched the ball arc through the air, a dark speck against the bright sky. It cleared the outer wall of the Dutch stockade. It cleared the line of tents where their sick lay.

It dropped, with the precision of a hawk, into the centre of their camp.

For a heartbeat, nothing happened.

Then the world turned white.

A roar, deeper and louder than any thunder, punched the air. It knocked men off their feet in our forward trenches. My horse reared, screaming. I fought to control him, my own ears ringing, the breath driven from my lungs by the shockwave.

A pillar of flame stood over the Dutch camp. It climbed higher and higher, boiling with black smoke, debris spinning in its heart like leaves in a cyclone.

“The magazine,” Dhanaji screamed, his voice sounding thin through the ringing in my ears. “They hit the powder store!” Or the rice store. Or both. It didn't matter. Fire swept through the stockade, hungry and fast, fed by the wind. We could see tiny figures running, flailing. We could hear the pops of muskets cooking off in the heat, small echoes of the great blast.

Secondary explosions rippled out, barrels of powder, grenades, anything that could burn. The structures they had built, the food they had hoarded, the shelter they had clung to, all of it was being consumed.

“Hold fire!” Varma’s voice cut through the confusion. He had mounted his horse and was riding down the line. “Stop the guns! Let the fire do the work!”

We stood and watched the destruction. It was awe-inspiring and horrific.

The Dutch were running to the water’s edge now, abandoning their walls. But there were no boats to take them all. The ships, seeing the explosion, had pulled back, fearful of the batteries or perhaps simply realizing the futility.

The garrison was trapped between the inferno and the surf.

Through my glass, I saw officers trying to form lines, to maintain some order, but the chaos was too absolute. Men were beating out flames on their coats. Others were dragging wounded comrades into the wet sand.

The siege was effectively over.

They had no food. Their powder was gone. Their shelter was ash.

As the sun began to set, painting the smoke-stained sky in lurid purples and reds, the fire finally burned itself down to glowing embers. The Dutch huddled on the beach, a broken remnant of the force that had landed with such arrogance.

I rode up to where Ramayyan stood.

“They are done,” I said. “Yes,” he said softly. “They are done.” He looked at the king.

“Shall we finish them?” a captain asked.

Marthanda Varma looked at the miserable huddle on the sand, at the ships turning away in the deepening twilight.

“No,” he said. “Dead men cannot sign treaties. And they cannot teach us how to build what they just lost.”

He turned his horse away.

“Let them simmer tonight,” he said. “Let them taste the ash. Tomorrow, we will see what remains.”

The siege of Colachel had not ended with a charge. It had ended with a single, terrible thunderclap.

But as I looked at the smoking ruin, I knew the silence that would follow would be more dangerous than the noise. For now came the words. And words, in my experience, could be sharper than any sword.
