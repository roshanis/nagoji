# Blood and Thrones, Book 2: The Dutchman's Son

## Working Title: The Dutchman's Son

### Core Premise

Pieter van der Berg was sixteen years old when the Dutch army marched on Travancore and was destroyed at Colachel. Captured, converted, and trained by Eustachius De Lannoy, he becomes an artillery officer in the army he once fought against. Now in his forties, he serves under the aging De Lannoy during the reign of Dharma Raja, witnesses his mentor's death, and watches as a new threat rises from the north - Hyder Ali of Mysore, whose rockets and disciplined armies make the Dutch look like amateurs.

This is the story of a man caught between worlds - European by birth, Travancorean by choice - as the old order crumbles and a new, more dangerous era begins.

### Series Position

- **Book 1, Marthanda Varma (1730s-1753):** Horse of the Servant - Nagoji Sawant's transformation from prisoner to general, the defeat of the Dutch, the building of Travancore.
- **Book 2, Dharma Raja (1753-1782):** The Dutchman's Son - Pieter van der Berg's journey from captured soldier to artillery commander, the death of De Lannoy, the rise of Hyder Ali.
- **Book 3, Tipu Sultan (1782-1799):** Tiger's Heir - Bhalerao's story, Tipu's invasion, the siege of Seringapatam.

### Time Period

1753-1782, covering:

### Narrator

**Pieter van der Berg** (later called **Padmanabhan Pillai** after conversion), telling his story in first person past tense.

- Technically precise - an artilleryman who thinks in trajectories and angles
- Increasingly weary as the old world dies around him
- Fluent in multiple languages, comfortable in multiple cultures, at home in none

## Epilogue: The Torch Passes

Pieter, now in his late fifties, writes his account. He knows he will not live to see the end of the story. But he has done what he can - maintained the walls, trained the gunners, kept faith with De Lannoy's memory.

Somewhere in the north, a young Maratha named Bhalerao is fleeing south with blood on his hands and a brand on his forehead. Their paths may cross. Or they may not. But the story continues, one outsider to another, one transformation to another.

Travancore takes what it needs. It took De Lannoy. It took Nagoji. It took Pieter.

Soon it will take Bhalerao.

The wheel turns. The story goes on.

## Historical Notes

### Key Events to Incorporate

1. **Death of Marthanda Varma (1758)** - Transition to Dharma Raja
2. **Rise of Hyder Ali (1760s)** - From soldier to Sultan of Mysore
3. **First Anglo-Mysore War (1767-1769)** - Hyder vs. British coalition
4. **Construction of Nedumkotta** - The Travancore Lines, a 48km defensive wall
5. **Death of De Lannoy (1777)** - End of an era

7. **Battle of Pollilur (1780)** - Mysorean rockets devastate British forces
8. **Death of Hyder Ali (1782)** - Tipu Sultan succeeds him

### The Dutch in Travancore

After Colachel (1741), several Dutch soldiers chose to stay in Travancore:
- Some converted; some remained Christian and married locally
- They formed a small community of "country-born" Europeans
- Their children were mixed heritage, often serving in the military
- By the 1770s-80s, they were dying out or assimilating completely
- Pieter represents this transitional generation

### Mysorean Rockets

Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan pioneered military rockets:
- Iron-cased rockets with greater range and stability than European equivalents
- Used en masse to break enemy formations
- Terrifying psychological weapon
- Later influenced British rocket development (Congreve rockets)

## Thematic Elements

### Continuity with Book 1

1. **Transformation** - Pieter's journey mirrors Nagoji's
2. **Travancore as crucible** - The kingdom that remakes outsiders
3. **Mentor relationships** - De Lannoy to Pieter as Ramayyan was to Nagoji
4. **The cost of belonging** - What is lost when you become something new
5. **European powers** - Dutch giving way to British

### Setup for Book 3

1. **Hyder Ali's legacy** - The threat that Tipu will inherit
2. **The Nedumkotta** - The walls Pieter helps build will be tested
3. **Bhalerao's arrival** - Can be foreshadowed or shown at the end
4. **The next generation** - What happens to those who are neither one thing nor another

### Unique Themes for Book 2

1. **The dying of the light** - Watching an era end, a mentor die
2. **Courage without belonging** - Caspar as counterpoint to Pieter's harder-earned integration
3. **Technology and war** - The rockets, the new age of destruction
4. **The European perspective** - Seeing India through eyes that are both inside and outside

## Voice Notes

### Pieter's Distinctive Voice

Unlike Nagoji (passionate, physical, transforming) or Bhalerao (dark, self-loathing, desperate), Pieter is:

- **Observational** - He watches and records, the outsider's eye
- **Technical** - Artillery training shapes his thinking
- **Melancholic** - He knows he doesn't fully belong anywhere
- **Philosophical** - More inclined to reflection than action
- **Multilingual** - Thinks in Dutch, speaks Malayalam, prays in Latin

### Sample Voice

*"I have lived in Travancore for forty years, and I am still not certain what I am. The Dutch would call me a deserter, a traitor, a man who forgot his blood. The Travancoreans call me Padmanabhan Pillai, as if a name could make me one of them. My children have skin the colour of tea with milk, and they speak Malayalam as their mother tongue, and they will never see Amsterdam or Batavia or any of the places my fathers came from. What does that make them? What does that make me?*

*De Lannoy said it did not matter. He said we become what we do, not what we were born. I believed him then. I am less certain now, watching his coffin lowered into Travancorean soil, listening to prayers spoken in languages he was not born to.*

*Perhaps he was right. Perhaps becoming is enough. Or perhaps we are all just pretending, wearing masks that grow so familiar we forget they are masks at all."*

## Chapter Count

32 chapters across 4 parts, covering approximately 30 years (1753-1782), plus an epilogue.

This gives roughly:
- 8 chapters per part
- 2,500-4,000 words per chapter
- Total: 80,000-120,000 words for Book 2

---

## Development Notes (Drafting Recommendations)

1. **Timeline clarity**: Decide whether Book 2 ends cleanly at **1782 (Hyder's death)** as a hinge, or extends to **1784** to cover the full Second Anglo-Mysore War. If ending at 1782, make Chapter 32 and the epilogue acknowledge that the war continues.
2. **De Lannoy's faith**: Keep De Lannoy Catholic to the end; his chapel life and funeral rites become a recurring reminder that Travancore uses outsiders but never fully absorbs them.
3. **Caspar's arc**: Keep him brave on-page. Let his drinking and gambling read as aftermath and restlessness, not cowardice, and give him at least two clear moments where his courage saves lives (for example the Udayagiri powder accident, then his choice to take the most dangerous posting).
4. **Anchor set pieces**: Add 2-3 suspense scenes driven by Pieter's technical mind (examining rocket damage, a night emplacement on the Nedumkotta in monsoon conditions, an artillery drill that turns into disaster).
5. **Book 3 handoff**: Decide how to introduce Bhalerao so the baton-pass feels earned, and keep the dates consistent (cameo in refugee columns, or a parallel epilogue vignette set earlier).
