# Working Title: Horse of the Monsoon
## A Nagoji Sawant Novel in the Spirit of Shogun

### Core Premise

- A Maratha cavalry officer, Nagoji Sawant, survives Portuguese dungeons and shipwreck to wash up in Travancore in **1735**, nearly six years before the decisive war that will break Dutch power on the Malabar coast.  
- As an outsider to both European empires and southern courts, Nagoji becomes the perfect lens through which we enter a world of matrilineal royals, temple politics, Arab and Marakkar seafarers, and rival Indian powers learning how to kill Europeans at their own game.  
- The novel follows Nagoji from prisoner to prized military asset, from almost insider at Marthanda Varma's court to cavalry general under De Lannoy, as he chooses to bind his fate to a southern kingdom built to resist European power.

### Tone and Style

- First person, present‑feeling past tense, in Nagoji's voice.  
- Immersive, sensory, character driven, with the political and military stakes always visible beneath personal conflicts.  
- Structurally similar in ambition to Shogun, but focused on the Malabar coast and Deccan world, not on Japan.

### Major Characters

- **Nagoji Sawant**: Thirty year old Maratha cavalry officer from near present day Nashik, landlocked by birth, once proud, now scarred by Portuguese torture and haunted by comrades left behind. He has family and fields in the black soil of the Deccan, has never truly known the sea except when dragged to Goa, and carries a tactical mind, dry wit, and deep loyalty to the idea of Maratha freedom more than to any single sardar. His driving motivation is to return to Chimaji Appa to help him liberate Goa and take revenge on the Portuguese; this goal sustains him until Chapter 24, where he ultimately gives it up but never forgets it.  
- **Marthanda Varma**: The Tiger of Travancore, brilliant and ruthless king who has built a new kind of state designed to survive European power. Alternates between paternal charm and cold, ledger like calculation.  
- **Ramayyan**: Diwan, spymaster, and General. A Brahmin who wields both the ledger and the sword with equal precision. Soft spoken, precise, terrifying when crossed. Sees Nagoji as both tool and potential threat.  
- **Eustachius De Lannoy**: Dutch officer captured at Colachel, remade as Travancore's chief European military adviser. Mirror and rival to Nagoji, the foreigner who becomes more inner circle than the Indian outsider.  
- **Padmini Amma**: Fictional Nair noblewoman and estate holder who commands her own troops through male relatives. Knows the court and countryside both, becomes Nagoji's practical guide to Travancore's structure and to the power of Malabar women.  
- **Revathi Bayi**: Fictional Travancore princess from a powerful matrilineal line, politically conscious, sharp tongued, fiercely independent. She and Nagoji fall in love, but she ultimately refuses to marry him because he binds himself to Marthanda Varma, whose centralising project threatens the older aristocratic order she is sworn to protect.  
- **Ibrahim Marakkar**: Muslim sea captain, smuggler, sometimes privateer, sitting at the intersection of Arab, local, and European trade networks. Owes Nagoji a debt and collects favours in return.  
- **Father Duarte**: Portuguese Jesuit with sincere faith and compromised loyalties, connected to Nagoji's time in Goa. Embodies the moral ambiguity of empire.  
- **Keshavrao**: Young Maratha horseman who shared Nagoji's cell in Goa. His fate, known or unknown, drives Nagoji's choices long after Travancore.

### Book Structure

- **Book I: Chains and Surf**  
  Focus: Portuguese dungeons, shipboard horror, and Nagoji's arrival in Travancore as wreckage that becomes an opportunity.  
- **Book II: Court of the Tiger (1735-1740)**  
  Focus: The "Years of Consolidation." Nagoji's education in Travancore politics and his participation in Marthanda Varma's ruthless internal wars against the *Ettuveetil Pillamar* (Eight Houses) and rebellious barons. This period establishes him as a trusted commander before the Dutch threat fully materializes.
- **Book III: After the Dutch (1741)**  
  Focus: The political reshaping of Malabar after Colachel, Travancore's expansion, the Dutch humbled, and Nagoji caught between Ramayyan's plans and his own sense of Maratha duty.  
- **Book IV: Teeth of the Tiger**  
  Focus: Nagoji's decision to remain in Travancore, his rise as cavalry general under De Lannoy, and his part in forging a state designed to survive both Europeans and Indian rivals.

## Book I: Chains and Surf

- ### Chapter 1: Dungeons of Goa

- Open in the Portuguese interrogation chamber in Goa, Nagoji shackled, nails torn, joints twisted. The scene shows torture not as spectacle but as mechanical, bureaucratic cruelty.  
- Introduce Father Duarte as a witness to the interrogation, inwardly uneasy but outwardly complicit.  
- Through interrogation questions we learn Nagoji's past in fragments: Maratha campaigns, previous clashes with Portuguese, his capture during a failed raid on a coastal fort.  
- The chapter ends with Nagoji hearing rumours of a transfer of prisoners to a ship bound south, a move he understands as both threat and chance.

### Chapter 2: The Slave Ship South

- Nagoji and other Indian prisoners, shackled in the hold of a Portuguese ship, are prepared for transport, perhaps to labour in some colonial outpost.  
- Introduce Keshavrao, the younger Maratha who looks to Nagoji as a leader. Show Nagoji's reluctance to be responsible for another life again.  
- On deck, Nagoji glimpses Father Duarte arguing with the Portuguese captain about the prisoners' treatment, revealing divided European opinions without excusing the system.  
- A storm builds through the chapter, mirroring the prisoners' rising desperation, until it breaks at night, the ship pitching violently in the monsoon swell.

### Chapter 3: The Choice in the Storm

- The storm hits with full force, waves smashing over the decks, sailors shouting in Portuguese, prisoners choking as water fills the hold.  
- Chains snap; some prisoners free themselves in the chaos. Others drown still bound.  
- Nagoji must choose between saving himself and risking everything to free Keshavrao. He tries, but in the confusion Keshavrao is either pulled away or forced to stay behind, leaving Nagoji with survivor's guilt.  
- The chapter ends with Nagoji thrown into black water, clinging to splintered timber as lightning reveals the ship's broken silhouette.

### Chapter 4: The Fishermen of the Pepper Coast

- Nagoji awakens on a Malabar beach under a flat grey sky, lungs burning, body shattered.  
- Local fishermen find him and argue in Malayalam that he barely understands. Some want to leave him; others see the calluses of a warrior and scars of torture and sense value.  
- Introduce Ibrahim Marakkar, tied to coastal networks that feed information up to Travancore. He recognises that a Maratha cavalryman with experience against Europeans could be valuable to the king.  
- The chapter closes with Nagoji loaded onto an ox cart, leaving behind the beach and Portuguese wreckage, entering pepper groves and the smell of monsoon earth.

### Chapter 5: Road to Travancore

- The journey along the Malabar coast, seen through Nagoji's eyes as a Deccan man noticing differences in landscape, language, food, and social customs.  
- At wayside shrines and small ports, Ibrahim collects news: Dutch friction with Travancore, Marakkar ships cutting supply lines, rumours of a king who refuses European terms.  
- Nagoji learns a few words of Malayalam, enough to start seeing patterns, and we see Padmini Amma's name mentioned as a landholder near the planned route and hear distant talk of a princess, Revathi Bayi, whose temper is nearly as famous as the king's.  
- The chapter ends with the first glimpse of Travancore's coastal fortifications rising above the tree line, different from northern forts yet built with clear purpose.

### Chapter 6: The Coastal Hall

- Nagoji is brought to a campaign hall near the Colachel shore, not a distant palace. Maps on the floor, spears resting against coconut pillars, salt on the air.  
- First sight of Marthanda Varma, sitting low amid campaign chests, more general than king in his bearing. Ramayyan stands nearby, silent, watching everything.  
- The audience is formal but stripped of ornament. The king questions Nagoji about cavalry tactics against men with guns, Portuguese habits, Maratha politics.  
- The chapter ends on a small but telling act: Marthanda Varma orders food and basic care for Nagoji, practical kindness that feels like strategy more than charity, leaving Nagoji uncertain whether he is guest or weapon.

## Book II: Court of the Tiger

### Chapter 7: Horses in Wet Sand

- Nagoji is ordered to assess Travancore's cavalry, including Nair horsemen and a hired regiment from the Nawab of Arcot.  
- Early training scenes go badly; wet sand and unfamiliar horses make Deccan drills fail, and local captains resent an outsider giving orders.  
- Nagoji adapts, watching how local riders move, mixing Maratha tactics with regional realities. Over months of drilling, he earns a grudging nod from local Nair officers, beginning his integration into the state's growing machine.

### Chapter 8: Padmini Amma's Estate

- Nagoji is billeted near the lands of Padmini Amma, a matrilineal Nair noblewoman who controls pepper estates and provides troops through her male relatives.  
- Their first encounter is tense. She sees Nagoji as both asset and risk, an armed outsider close to the king. He sees in her a form of female authority and frankness unfamiliar to Maratha customs and is quietly startled by how Malabar women speak and command.  
- Through estate life we learn about matriliny, female property rights, and Travancore's dependence on pepper revenue, with Padmini Amma explaining how royal women like Revathi Bayi sit at the apex of this order.  
- The chapter closes with Padmini Amma offering a conditional alliance, words that may be respect or warning, and hinting that if Nagoji wants to understand Travancore, he will one day have to face its princesses, not only its king.

### Chapter 9: Princess of Velinadu

- Nagoji meets Revathi Bayi for the first time at a ritual or diplomatic gathering tied to the Velinadu line, introduced by Padmini Amma in a setting where men are expected to listen more than speak.  
- He is disoriented by Revathi's blunt political questions and her refusal to fawn over Marthanda Varma, seeing for the first time that not all aristocratic women support the king's centralising project.  
- Their banter carries an instant charge: she mocks his Deccan assumptions, he is drawn to the way she treats him as a man to argue with, not a soldier to command, planting the seeds of mutual attraction.  
- The chapter ends with Revathi dismissing him with a cool remark about men who lend their swords to kings they do not fully understand, a line that stays with him.

### Chapter 10: Lessons in Travancore

- Nagoji moves through layers of Travancore society: temple courtyards, training grounds, market streets near the coast.  
- He discovers how deeply religion, military organisation, and landholding are intertwined, and how Ramayyan's hand is present everywhere, often unseen.  
- A quiet conversation with Ibrahim Marakkar by the docks reveals how sea power and spice trade underpin Travancore's ambitions.  
- The chapter covers the passage of years (1736-1738) as the King systematically breaks the power of the *Ettuveetil Pillamar*. Nagoji rides in these internal police actions, learning that "civilized war" in Kerala is just as bloody as Deccan raids.

### Chapter 11: Dutch on the Horizon

- From coastal watch posts and small craft, Ibrahim and other seafarers bring word of Dutch ships manoeuvring offshore under the command of a hard drilling European officer Nagoji does not yet see.  
- In the war hall Nagoji and Ramayyan study maps and reports, Nagoji offering cavalry ideas while the king and his diwan weigh how far they can push the Dutch before open war.  
- We hear De Lannoy's name for the first time only as a rumour attached to Dutch discipline, a shadow on the sea rather than a presence in the court.  
- The chapter ends with Nagoji watching lanterns move on distant masts at night, knowing that somewhere out there is a commander he will one day have to face, though he would not yet recognise the man.

### Chapter 12: Threads of Alliance

- Court scene in which Dutch envoys, local chieftains, temple authorities, and Marakkar captains all jostle for influence.  
- Nagoji watches who speaks, who is silent, who whispers to whom. Padmini Amma maneuvers with understated skill, Ramayyan steers outcomes with small, quiet interventions, and Revathi Bayi watches with a princess's cool detachment.  
- Nagoji begins to understand that he is not simply training horsemen; he is a piece on a board that stretches from Goa to Batavia.  
- The chapter closes with Ramayyan warning Nagoji, politely, that every favour has a price in Travancore.

### Chapter 13: The Eve of Colachel

- Tension rises as news arrives of Dutch fleets offshore and allied local powers gathering.  
- Nagoji prepares his cavalry, Padmini Amma secures her estates, Revathi Bayi moves within palace walls to calm or sharpen aristocratic fears, and the king and Ramayyan refine their trap, responding to fragmentary reports of Dutch movements and their mysterious commander.  
- Personal stakes sharpen: Nagoji realises that if Travancore falls, he may end in Portuguese hands again, yet victory may bind him more tightly to this southern court.  
- The chapter ends at night, with Nagoji listening to the sea and horses shifting in the dark, knowing dawn will bring a battle that could change the coast.

### Chapter 14: The Siege of Colachel

- Full battle of Colachel from Nagoji's saddle, expanding the existing scene into a longer, tactically clear but sensory rich sequence.  
- Show Travancore musketeers in prepared positions, Dutch squares forming, the first volleys, and Nagoji's cavalry exploiting weaknesses with precision.  
- In the chaos, Nagoji glimpses De Lannoy's capture or surrender, a moment that will reshape Travancore more than any single death.  
- The chapter ends not with triumph, but with Nagoji seeing dead horses, broken men, and realising how thin victory feels compared to the cost.

### Chapter 15: Prisoners of a New King

- Dutch prisoners are processed and evaluated. Some are to be ransomed, some exchanged, some potentially recruited.  
- De Lannoy is questioned by Marthanda Varma and Ramayyan in a scene that mirrors Nagoji's own first interrogation in Goa, but with crucial differences in tone and purpose.  
- Nagoji watches, recognising in De Lannoy another man who may be turned into a weapon for a different crown.  
- The chapter ends with De Lannoy accepting Travancore service under strict conditions, while Nagoji feels his own position shift from unique outsider to one foreigner among several.

### Chapter 16: Building a New Army

- Time skip forward as Travancore retools its military using lessons from Colachel and De Lannoy's expertise.  
- Nagoji trains cavalry for new roles, De Lannoy reshapes fortifications and infantry drills, Ramayyan keeps the machine aligned with the kingdom's interests.  
- Padmini Amma negotiates protection and obligations for her estates within the new military framework, showing how reform touches every level of society and how aristocratic women must adjust.  
- The chapter ends with Nagoji realising that this army is being built not just to fight Dutch, but to shape the entire southern political map.

### Chapter 17: Adoption of the Stranger

- The King, his sister (Senior Rani), and the young heir visit Padmini Amma's estate in secret.
- It is revealed that Padmini sheltered the King when he was a hunted child thirty years ago, creating a lifelong debt.
- To anchor Nagoji (who has no clan or local roots) to the land, the King bribes the priesthood to "discover" a lost Nair lineage for him, converting him via a paid ritual.
- Padmini formally adopts Nagoji into her House as a Nair, giving him a "root" in Travancore, though he remains a "stranger" by blood. He is named "Nagoji of Padmini's House."
- The chapter establishes Nagoji's conflicting identities: mercenary vs. son of the soil.

### Chapter 18: Dutch Come Bowing

- Extended version of the Dutch envoys' visit after their defeat, seen from Nagoji's vantage point at the edge of the court.  
- Negotiations show the reversal of power: Dutch now forced to recognise Travancore's sovereignty and pay for trading rights they once took.  
- De Lannoy's ambiguous position is laid bare: technically still Dutch by birth, now Travancore by oath, his expression unreadable as his former superiors bargain from weakness.  
- The chapter ends with Ramayyan quietly instructing Nagoji to remember every detail, in case the Maratha world ever doubts that Europeans can be humbled.

### Chapter 19: Shadows of the Deccan

- News reaches Nagoji of events in the Deccan: Maratha internal conflicts, Peshwa politics, shifting alliances with and against other Indian powers.  
- Letters or rumours about Keshavrao's fate, or the fate of their old sardar, unsettle Nagoji's sense of where he belongs.  
- A private conversation with Marthanda Varma reveals the king's view of the Marathas, admiration mixed with caution, hinting that Nagoji can never be fully trusted.  
- Nagoji sends his final bag of gold north to his brother, severing his financial tie to his old home, and takes the name "Ananthan Pillai" to mark his transition.

### Chapter 20: Guest in Velinadu

- Nagoji is summoned to Velinadu by Revathi Bayi.
- She confronts him about his loyalties: to the King versus to the land and its old houses.
- They discuss marriage. Revathi accepts him, but with the condition that in Velinadu (a matrilineal house), he will always be a "guest" and a visitor to his own children's lineage.
- Nagoji accepts this status ("My pride died at Colachel"), and they marry without pomp. This cements his personal stake in the land's future.

### Chapter 21: Ramayyan's Ledger

- Nagoji discovers that Ramayyan keeps detailed records on every important person at court, including him.  
- He confronts Ramayyan about this, and receives a calm explanation that in a small kingdom surrounded by enemies, ignorance is a luxury.  
- Their exchange becomes a philosophical duel about loyalty, necessity, and how far a state may go to survive.  
- The chapter closes with Ramayyan updating his ledger to reflect Nagoji's marriage and deepening roots.

## Book IV: Teeth of the Tiger

### Chapter 23: First Campaign for the Tiger

- Nagoji leads cavalry in a campaign against a local chief or confederation allied with Dutch interests (Kollamkara).
- He forces his cavalry to act as a hammer to De Lannoy's infantry anvil, proving the new army's worth but alienating traditional Nair captains.
- Padmini Amma's estates lie near the contested zone, forcing Nagoji to scorch fields to deny cover to enemies.
- The chapter closes with a hard won victory and a reprimand from Ramayyan regarding brutality, showing the King's pragmatic approval of "necessary cruelty."

- Court factions resent the growing influence of two foreigners at the centre of Travancore's army.

### Chapter 25: Ramayyan's Test
