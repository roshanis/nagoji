# Book III, Chapter 20: Guest in Velinadu

Some months after Colachel and before fire ever touched Padmini's upper fields, the summons from Velinadu came on a piece of cloth, not a palm leaf.

Padmini handed it to me under the jackfruit tree, her fingers lingering on the edge as if reluctant to let it go.

“She asks,” Padmini said, “not commands. That is already different.”

The cloth was dyed a deep green, the colour Revathi favoured. The message, stitched in fine Malayalam, was brief.

*Come to Velinadu when the next moon is full. There is a decision to be made that cannot be written.*

It was not signed.

It did not need to be.

---

Velinadu had changed since my first visit.

The walls were thicker. The halls felt more crowded. Children’s voices echoed in courtyards where once only older women had sat. Men with muskets now stood at certain gates where before there had been only spears.

Yet the bones of the place remained the same.

The long verandah where Revathi had first watched me, coins at her throat catching the light. The training pit where boys learned to move with sticks while their sisters watched and commented. The inner courtyard where pepper and politics were weighed together.

She met me there, under the same beam of carved wood, her hair now threaded with more grey, her eyes no less sharp.

“Ananthan Pillai,” she said, inclining her head the smallest fraction. “Or do you still answer to Nagoji when you dream?”

“Depends on the dream,” I said.

Her mouth twitched.

“You have not grown less infuriating,” she said.

We walked the length of the verandah in silence for a while, listening to the household move around us. Women’s bangles. The thud of grain being pounded. The distant shout of a boy in the kalari.

She stopped near a pillar and rested her hand against it.

“Because I am tired,” she said. “And I am besieged.”

She turned to face me fully.

“My uncles bring proposals every week,” she said. “Men of good lineage. Men with land. Men whose feet are firmly planted in this red soil. They promise safety. They promise that the weight of this house will not rest solely on my shoulders.”

“And yet you sent a green cloth to a landless Maratha,” I said.

“Because safety bores me,” she admitted, a ghost of a smile touching her lips. “But fear does not.”

She took a step closer, her eyes searching mine.

“I am afraid, Nagoji. Not of war. Of you.”

“Me?”

“You are a man of the sword,” she said. “And you are a man of the Deccan. Your heart beats to a rhythm I do not know. If I marry you, will you stay true? Or will you one day wake, smell the dust of the north, and ride back to your hills, leaving me with memories and ghosts?”

“The Deccan is my past,” I said. “You are my present.”

“Present is fleeting,” she countered. “And there is another thing. A harder thing.”

She straightened, her chin lifting in that regal way that always made my breath catch.

“I am not a woman who walks three paces behind. I am the matriarch of Velinadu. I sit in councils. I command men. Can you, a warrior who has ridden with kings, accept a woman as his equal? Not in the shadows, in the light?”

“I have ridden with Padmini Amma,” I said. “I know what a woman with iron in her spine looks like.”

“Padmini is your mother by oath,” she said. “I would be your wife. It is different. A husband expects to rule. Here, you will not rule.”

She gestured to the house around us.

“This is *Marumakkathayam*, Nagoji. The lineage runs through the women. If we have children, sons or daughters, they will belong to Velinadu. They will be of my house, not yours. You will be the father, loved and honoured, but you will be a visitor in their heritage. Can your pride accept that? Can you watch your son grow up belonging to a world where you are always, in some small way, a guest?”

The question hung heavy in the air.

I looked at the stone under our feet. I thought of the pride of my ancestors, the patrilineal certainty of the Marathas. Then I looked at her, at the strength in her jaw, the vulnerability in her eyes.

“My pride died at Colachel,” I said softly. “It was reborn as something else. Something that values the root over the branch.”

“I will always be a guest here,” I said. “If you can spare me a corner of your house and a sliver of your heart, that is enough.”

Her eyes closed briefly.

“You already hold more than a sliver,” she said. “But I have responsibilities. To this land. To these people. You are an honoured guest here, and a guest under Padmanabha's sky. This land was never yours to own. Only to serve.”

“My own ‘house’ is a neem in the fort courtyard and a jackfruit in Padmini's yard,” I said. “My only property is a horse that does not like cannon smoke.”

She smiled, genuinely this time.

“Then you lose nothing you truly possess,” she said. “And gain nieces who will argue with you and sons who will pretend to listen.”

The picture that rose in my mind at those words undid me more than any flattery could have.

Children’s feet on these stones. A small hand in mine, sticky with fruit, tugging me toward the kalari to show off a new strike. Revathi’s voice scolding me for teaching them dirty Deccan curses.

“Padmini knows?” I asked.

“She was the one who told me to stop being proud and send for you,” Revathi said. “She said, ‘If you must refuse him, do it with a full stomach, not an empty bed.’”

I laughed, the sound startling us both.

“And Ramayyan?” I asked.

“He has already written three lines in his ledger about the possible outcomes,” she said. “He will adjust the fourth when we tell him what we have decided.”

“My house,” I said slowly, “will always be Padmini Amma’s courtyard and whatever barracks and walls the king sends me to. My name in the Deccan is already a ghost. If I marry you, I do not become lord of Velinadu. I become another story whispered in its corridors.”

“Yes,” she said. “One more story. One more thread in the cloth. That is all any of us are.”

I stepped closer.

“Then let it be written,” I said.

She let out a breath I had not known she was holding.

“Do not expect wedding songs,” she said. “We are too old for that nonsense.”

“You are,” I said. “I, on the other hand, am ageless.”

She snorted.

“You will sleep in the small room near the western verandah,” she said briskly, slipping back into command. “Your horse will stay at the outer stable. You will attend morning rites when you are here and drills when you are not. You will not teach our nieces to gamble with cowrie shells.”

“I make no promises about the cowries,” I said.

Her hand brushed mine, the same light touch as on that verandah after the Dutch bowed, years ago. This time, neither of us pretended not to feel it.

---

The marriage itself was smaller than any court scribe would have wanted and larger than either of us would admit mattered.

There were no trumpets, only drums. No foreign captains, only house elders. No long lines of guests, only those who had carried these years with us.

Padmini stood beside Revathi as the priest tied the *tali* around her neck, her stick planted firm, her eyes bright. Lannoy, awkward in local cloth, stood near the back, watching with the expression of a man who could not decide whether this counted as a military alliance or something more dangerous. Ramayyan hovered near a pillar, lips moving as if already turning the scene into neat lines on palm leaves.

When Revathi and I walked the small circle before the goddess, the lamps flickered in a draft. For a heartbeat, the flames leaned toward us, then straightened, as if acknowledging a new pattern in the air.

Later, in the quiet of the western verandah, after the rituals and the teasing and the first awkward attempts at sharing a space that was hers before it was ours, she sat with her back against a pillar and watched the courtyard.

“Do you feel married?” she asked.

“I feel like a guest who has been told he may stay past sunset,” I said.

“Good,” she said. “Never forget you are that. When you ride out, you carry more than your own name now. You carry mine. You carry the children we may have and the ones who will claim us in stories. Do not make them spit when they say ‘Ananthan Pillai’.”

She fell silent for a moment, watching a single lamp flame gutter and steady again in the courtyard below.

“My mother died when I was young,” she said, voice low. “Sometimes I try to remember her face and find only the lines other people drew for me. I do not want our children to know me only as a name on land records and in Ramayyan's leaves.”

“They will know you as the woman who kept their house standing when kings and companies tried to pull it apart,” I said.

“They will know me as the woman who sent their father to the marches,” she replied. “Do not let them hate me for that.”

“If they must hate anyone, let it be me,” I said. “I will tell them it was my choice to ride. Yours to keep the roof over their heads.”

“I will try to give them reasons to argue over me instead,” I said. “Half will call me fool. Half will call me necessary.”

“All will call you loud,” she said.

We sat in companionable silence, listening to the house settle. Somewhere a child laughed in its sleep. Somewhere a woman scolded a man for stepping on freshly washed stone.

For the first time since Goa, since the dungeon, since the storm, I felt something like rest.

Not peace. The world beyond Velinadu still boiled. Mysore still watched. The British and the French still bartered with Arcot. The Dutch still counted their losses. Travancore still balanced on knives.

But here, in this courtyard where jackfruit and pepper and queens and ledgers and old grudges all shared the same air, I was no longer only a sword.

I was also a husband.

And, in time, a father whose children ran these stones and called this place home, even as they learned to ride under a king whose kingdom we had both helped, and hindered, and loved into being.
