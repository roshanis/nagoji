# Chapter 21: Ramayyan's Ledger

I had always known that Ramayyan wrote things down.

You could see it in the ink stains on his fingers, in the callus where his stylus rested, in the way his eyes drifted for a moment when someone spoke, as if he were already filing the words away on some inner page.

What I had not seen, until that afternoon, was the scale of his book.

It was not a single volume, of course. It was a room.

I found it by accident.

We were in the fort, discussing the placement of a new storehouse, when a sudden rain squall rolled in from the sea, grey and angry. Men scrambled to cover powder barrels. The meeting scattered. Looking for shelter, I ducked through a doorway I had not used before, expecting a small guard room.

Instead, I stepped into a space where history sat in rows.

Palm leaf bundles filled shelves from floor to ceiling. Each bundle was tied with string and marked with a small clay tag impressed with symbols. There was no dust. Someone came here often enough to keep it away.

At a low table in the centre of the room sat Ramayyan.

He did not look surprised to see me.

“You found my garden,” he said.

“Garden?” I asked, dripping rainwater onto the floor.

“These are the plants I tend,” he said, gesturing at the shelves. “Some bear fruit. Some only thorns.”

I stepped closer, careful not to brush against the bundles.

“What are they?” I asked, though I had already guessed.

“Records,” he said. “Of land. Of grain. Of taxes. Of temple offerings. Of letters. Of men.”

He picked up a bundle and untied it with the ease of long habit.

On the top leaf, in his neat hand, I saw a list of names.

Each name had lines of notes beside it. Places. Dates. Short phrases.

He ran a finger down the list and stopped on one.

Sawant, Nagoji.  
Origin: Deccan, near Nashik.  
First appearance: Goan dungeon, retrieved by Travancore allies.  
Skills: cavalry command, European engagement, adaptability.  
Family: father (farmer), mother, younger brother.  
Loyalties: to Maratha ideal, to personal honour, increasingly to Travancore king.  
Risks: potential Maratha recall (mitigated by Velinadu bond), emotional ties northward, relationship with Revathi Bayi (alliance tied, marriage).

The last word made me cough.

“You write this of me?” I asked.

“I would be negligent if I did not,” he said calmly. “You are a piece on the board. A valuable one. Pieces can be lost in many ways. I keep track.”

He turned a few more leaves.

Padmini Amma. Landholdings. Kin ties. Temper.  
He had already noted her heir in that tight script of his, a niece named Nandini who was still a child when I first saw the line. Years later he would add, in the same neat hand, the date of Padmini's death beside it.  
Revathi Bayi. Velinadu rights. Alliances. Known grudges.  
Eight Houses of the Marches. Old noble coalition. Broken formally, roots remain.  
Lannoy. Family in Europe. Letters sent and burned. Skills. Possible breaking points.

He turned another leaf, and I caught a glimpse before he moved on.

Elayadathu Swaroopam (Kottarakkara).  
Chief: confined. Health: declining. Succession: disputed.  
Senior lady: Savitri. Claims: legitimate under matrilineal law. Disposition: hostile.  
Dutch contact: confirmed. Letters intercepted: three.  
Velinadu connection: blood tie to Revathi Bayi. Leverage: significant.  
Risk assessment: HIGH. Timeline: before next monsoon.

The words “before next monsoon” had been underlined twice.

Ramayyan turned the leaf over before I could read more, but not before I saw his finger pause on one line. The line that said “Velinadu connection.”

He did not explain. I did not ask. Some ledgers are not meant to be read aloud.

He tapped Lannoy's name instead.

“He worries about his soul,” he said. “That is useful to know.”

I felt an odd mixture of amusement and discomfort.

“And you keep such lists on everyone?” I asked. “Even the king?”

“Especially the king,” he said. “He would be angry if I did not. He understands that forgetting is a luxury small kingdoms cannot afford.”

He retied the bundle and set it aside, then picked up another.

“This one is about land,” he said. “Who owns which field. Which temple claims what offering. Which house has a dispute with its neighbour that might flare into something worse. That is another kind of army.”

He gestured toward a shelf where tags bore the names of distant villages.

“If a chief in the north delays sending grain,” he said, “I can see from here whether his harvest failed or his greed grew. I do not have to ride there to find out.”

“You watch us all,” I said.

“Yes,” he said simply.

“Is that not... exhausting?” I asked.

He smiled, a little sadly.

“It is what I know how to do,” he said. “You count men and hooves. I count tendencies. Between us, perhaps we keep this place alive.”

I glanced back at the leaf with my own name on it.

“You write of my loyalties,” I said. “Do you write of your own?”

“Of course,” he said. “Only not where anyone else can read.”

He opened another bundle and let me see only the top line before snapping it shut.

Ramayyan.  
Loyalties: to the idea of a Travancore that outlives this generation. To the king as long as he remembers that.

“You will burn that if someone else ever comes in here,” I said.

For the first time since I had entered the room, something like weariness slipped past his careful composure.

“If someone else comes in here uninvited, there will be larger problems than old palm leaves,” he said. “Some days I wonder whether all this writing merely delays the avalanche. Then a small note saves a village or stops a fool from giving a Dutch factor too much pepper, and I pick up the stylus again.”

We stood in silence for a moment, surrounded by the soft murmur of the rain outside and the imagined rustle of all those recorded lives.

“Does it not feel like spying?” I asked. “Keeping such close watch on men who trust you?”

“Spying is what others call watching when they disapprove of the watchers,” he said. “I call it preparation. I have seen too many small kings fall because they believed goodwill would shield them from men with ships and guns. Goodwill is a poor shield. Knowledge is better.”

“Knowledge can twist,” I said. “It can make you see danger where there is none. It can make you cut men down before they have done anything, because you fear they might.”

He regarded me.

“You speak like someone who has seen that happen,” he said.

“In Pune, I watched a sardar order a loyal captain executed because a Brahmin said the stars looked wrong,” I said. “He had heard a rumour that the captain admired another chief. That rumour became fact in his mind because fear and jealousy filled the gaps. We lost a brave man. The supposed traitor never even drew his sword.”

Ramayyan nodded slowly.

“Fear is my enemy too,” he said. “That is why I write. It gives fear less room to invent.”

He gestured at the bundles again.

“When someone tells me that Padmini holds back grain,” he said, “I can look and see that last year her fields flooded and the year before she sent more than required. Gossip dies on paper like that. When a chief whispers that Revathi plots against the king, I can see that she has refused three offers from Dutch factors in the last month. I do not have to guess.”

“And when you see a line you do not like?” I asked. “What then?”

“Then I talk,” he said. “Or I watch more closely. Or I advise the king to move a piece before it moves itself. I am not omniscient, Nagoji. I can only reduce surprises.”

He looked at me, his gaze sharpening.

“You fear that one day you will open a letter from your brother and I will be reading over your shoulder, planning how to keep you from riding north,” he said.

“Should I not?” I asked.

“You should know that if I decide to keep you from riding north, it will not be because of a letter,” he said. “It will be because the balance of this kingdom requires it. If I decide it is better to let you go, it will be for the same reason. My ledger is not about you alone. You are one line in a very long text.”

There was no malice in his tone. That made it harder, not easier.

“Does it not trouble you,” I asked, “to think of people as lines on leaves?”

“Sometimes,” he said quietly. “Then I walk in the market. I stand in a temple. I eat at Padmini's hearth. I remind myself that these marks represent men and women with faces and voices. That keeps me from becoming what you fear. Or so I hope.”

He retied the bundle with my name and slid it back onto the shelf.

“You are disturbed,” he said. “That is good. Men who are comfortable being watched are either fools or tyrants.”

“And you?” I asked. “Which are you?”

He smiled again, that same sad twist.

“I am tired,” he said. “And determined. That is all.”

The rain outside had eased to a drizzle. The light in the room was soft, filtered through the high narrow window.

“Why show me this?” I asked. “You could have sent me away.”

“Because you walk with half your weight in the north and half here,” he said.

“I married into Velinadu,” I countered. “I sent my brother the final gold. I am here.”

“Marriages end,” Ramayyan said, unmoved. “Gold runs out. Roots are harder to kill than branches. I watch to ensure they do not regrow. You need to understand what you carry in this land. Not just your sword. Your shadow. You are not just a man who trains horses. You are a potential message. A symbol. A warning. It is better you see how I measure that than imagine monsters where there are only old men with styluses.”

“Old?” I said, raising an eyebrow.

He chuckled.

“Old in work, if not in years,” he said. “I have already seen three serious attempts to cut his life short. An arrow from the north wall, a priest with poison in the sanctum oil, a knife in the crush of a festival crowd. We caught those because someone, somewhere in these leaves, had written a warning in time. I would rather fill shelves than graves.”

I remembered that festival night.

The Maharaja had insisted on sweeping the inner stones at Padmanabhapuram himself before the lamps were lit, broom in his hands, forehead bare of crown, priests chanting while women set rows of flame along the walls. The crowd pressed in closer than Ramayyan liked, helpers and onlookers and curious men blending into one restless ring of bodies. When the first assassin moved, I saw him not by his face, but by the way his shoulders did not bend in reverence with everyone else's. His knife flashed toward the king's side. I caught his wrist and dragged him down, and in the tangle that followed the Maharaja slipped on spilled oil and struck his head on the flagstones. We killed two of the men there among the broken pots and scattered flowers. A third vanished into the press. We never learned whether he carried Dutch coin, Cochin promises, or only the old houses' grudges in his sleeve.

As I left the room, the shelves watched me with their mute rows.

Outside, the air smelled of wet stone and ink.

That night, lying under the jackfruit tree after the ground had dried, I thought of Ramayyan's ledger.

Of my line in it. Of Revathi's. Of Padmini's. Of Lannoy's. Of the king's own.

In Goa, a different kind of book had been kept, with names and numbers and punishments assigned. There, I had been a prisoner number. Here, I was a sentence in a longer story.

It was a small difference. It was also vast.

I did not know whether, in years to come, historians would praise Ramayyan as wise or condemn him as a spider. I only knew that without men like him, scribbling in rooms that smelled of coconut smoke and ink, kings like Marthanda Varma would stand even less chance against machines like the Dutch company and storm bent confederacies like my own.

We all kept ledgers, in our own ways.

Mine were carved in memories of hooves on sand and the weight of men's trust.

His were written in palm leaves and tags.

Both, I suspected, would matter when the next storm came.
