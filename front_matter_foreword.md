# Foreword

I wrote this series to raise awareness about eighteenth-century Travancore and its remarkable king, Marthanda Varma. His story deserves to be known beyond the borders of Kerala.

On the southwestern coast of India, Marthanda Varma inherited a kingdom beset by internal rivals and external powers. Through military reform, administrative clarity, and sheer ruthlessness, he forged it into a dominant state on the Malabar Coast.

He was a pragmatist. He was capable of great cruelty in service of greater order. He created institutions that outlasted him.

This is not a biography. It is a novel, told through the eyes of a fictional Maratha horseman who washes up on Travancore's shores and finds himself drawn into the king's orbit. But the king at the centre of the story is drawn from history, and I have tried to render him honestly.

## The King {.unlisted}

Marthanda Varma was pious. He was also ruthless. He was cunning, charming, and strong. He could be generous to those who served him and merciless to those who opposed him.

Some modern accounts paint him as a Hindu fanatic, a king who built temples and persecuted foreigners out of religious zeal. This is a misreading. Marthanda Varma employed Christians, Muslims, and Europeans in positions of trust throughout his reign. His most famous general, Eustachius De Lannoy, was a Catholic from Arras who served him until death. His commercial agents included Syrian Christians and Jewish merchants. His navy was commanded by Muslim Marakkars.

His beginnings were precarious. Growing up as a junior prince in Venad, he was fourth in line to the throne and ascended at age twenty-three only after the untimely deaths of his predecessors. He inherited a crown with limited authority; many nobles refused to recognize him, conspiring to depose and assassinate him repeatedly.

From these precarious beginnings, he rose to dominate the region, using every tool available to build a state: military reform, administrative clarity, and sheer ruthlessness.

## The Ettuveetil Pillamar {.unlisted}

The Ettuveetil Pillamar, the Eight Lords, appear in this novel as antagonists. I do not believe they were villains.

They were powerful men in a weak kingdom. For generations before Marthanda Varma, the Travancore royal family had been diminished, hemmed in by nobles who controlled the land, the armies, and the trade. The Pillamar were not usurpers; they were the real power. When a strong candidate appeared in the royal line, they did what powerful men have always done: they tried to remove the threat.

They failed.

Marthanda Varma arrested them, tried them summarily, and executed them. Their families were stripped of lands and titles. Some historians have called this draconian. It was. It was also effective. The message was clear: Travancore would no longer be ruled by committee. There would be one king, and the king would rule.

Were all of them guilty of regicide? Probably not. Were their punishments proportionate? By modern standards, no. But Marthanda Varma was not building a modern state. He was building a state that could survive, and survival required examples.

## The Thampis {.unlisted}

The king's cousins and nephews, the Thampis, also met harsh fates. Some were executed. Others were exiled. Modern readers may find this disturbing.

I find it rational.

In a matrilineal succession system, every male relative is a potential rival. The Thampis had claims to the throne, and they had supporters. If Marthanda Varma had spared them, they would have become rallying points for every disaffected noble, every displaced Pillamar, every foreign power looking for a lever. He would have spent his reign fighting civil wars instead of building walls.

He chose otherwise. History does not record that he lost sleep over it.

## The European Context {.unlisted}

To understand eighteenth-century Malabar, you must understand eighteenth-century Europe.

The wounds of the Thirty Years' War were barely a century old. The War of the Spanish Succession had ended within living memory. Religious hatreds that had torn the continent apart still simmered. The Dutch were fiercely Protestant, shaped by their long revolt against Catholic Spain. The Portuguese were equally fierce Catholics, veterans of the Inquisition. The English were Protestant but happy to fight anyone for commercial advantage. The French were Catholic but happy to ally with Protestants against mutual enemies.

These hatreds travelled with the trading companies.

When Dutch and Portuguese ships met off the Malabar Coast, they were not merely competing for pepper. They were continuing wars that had begun in Antwerp and Lisbon. When the English established their factory at Anchuthengu, they were not just building a warehouse. They were planting a flag in a conflict that stretched from London to Batavia.

The kings of Malabar learned to navigate these hatreds. They played the companies against each other, extracted concessions from all sides, and occasionally found themselves caught in the crossfire. Marthanda Varma was particularly skilled at this game. He took English loans, fought Dutch armies, and employed Portuguese priests, all while keeping his own counsel.

## The Armies {.unlisted}

The Dutch East India Company was not a Dutch army. It was a corporate military force drawn from across Europe and Asia.

Its officer corps included Germans, men from the Low Countries, French Huguenots, Danes, and Swedes. Its soldiers included men from Java and Bali, Indian lascars, and African slaves. The force that landed at Colachel in 1741 was a polyglot army serving a commercial enterprise headquartered in Amsterdam but fighting on a beach in South India.

This diversity was the Company's strength and its weakness. It could recruit soldiers from anywhere. But those soldiers had no particular loyalty to the Company beyond their pay. When the pay stopped or the cause seemed lost, they deserted, defected, or simply walked away.

De Lannoy was one such man. Born in Arras, trained in the Low Countries, shipped to Ceylon, and then, during the Colachel campaign, crossing the lines at Kanyakumari to enter Travancore service, he made a choice that the Company's ledgers could not have predicted. He stayed. He built. He died as the Valiya Kappittan of Travancore, buried in a chapel he constructed with his own money.

The companies brought their conflicts to India. But India absorbed them, transformed them, and made them serve purposes the directors in Amsterdam and London never imagined.

## A Note on Sources {.unlisted}

The historical events in this novel are drawn from a variety of sources, including the Travancore State Manual and various accounts of the Dutch East India Company's activities on the Malabar Coast, alongside modern historical scholarship on Travancore.

Where sources conflict, I have chosen the version that seems most defensible and best serves narrative coherence. Where sources are silent, I have invented. The result is fiction, not history. Readers seeking the historical record should consult the sources directly.

## Finally {.unlisted}

This is the first book of a series. It covers the period from roughly 1735s to 1750s, from Marthanda Varma's consolidation of power through the Battle of Colachel to the Thrippadidanam, when he dedicated his kingdom to the god Padmanabha.

The story continues in *The Dutchman's Son*, which follows the next generation through the reign of Dharma Raja and the coming storm from Mysore.

I hope these books bring a forgotten corner of Indian history to new readers. The men and women who built Travancore deserve to be remembered.
