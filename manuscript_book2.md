# The Dutchman's Son

*RV Menon*

1758: Udayagiri Fort. A Dutch boy raised Lutheran becomes Travancore's gunner. Hyder Ali rises in the north, and every wall begins to feel temporary.

# Chapter 1: The King's Death

The cannons spoke at dawn.

I counted them from the ramparts of Udayagiri - twenty-one guns, fired at measured intervals, five seconds between each report. A gunner's mind cannot help but measure. The powder charges were consistent, the crews well-drilled. Even in grief, Travancore maintained its standards.

The king was dead. Marthanda Varma had built this kingdom from blood and genius. He had broken the Dutch and humbled the old nobility, then at Mavelikara in 1753 forced the Company to swallow its meddling. In 1750 he had surrendered the kingdom to Sri Padmanabha and ruled as the deity's servant. Now he was gone.

I had served him for seventeen years. I had never spoken to him directly, not once. He was the king, and I was a captured Dutch gunner who had been permitted to live. The distance between us was measured in more than rank. And yet, standing on those walls as the smoke drifted across the morning sky, I felt something like grief.

Perhaps it was not grief for him. Perhaps it was grief for the world he had made, which would now have to survive without him.

---

My name is Pieter van der Berg. I was born in Batavia in the year of our Lord 1725, the son of a Dutch trader and a woman whose blood was mixed in ways my father never discussed. I joined the Dutch Company's army at fourteen, was shipped to Ceylon at fifteen, and was marching with the Dutch expedition against Travancore at sixteen.

That was in 1741. The Battle of Colachel, they called it later, though at the time it felt less like a battle than a slaughter. I remember the Travancorean lines emerging from the morning mist, more of them than we had expected, better armed than we had believed. I remember the sound of our formation breaking, the screams of men I had trained with dying in the mud. I remember running, and then not running, and then waking in chains with a wound in my side that should have killed me.

I was sixteen years old. I expected to die.

Instead, I met Eustachius De Lannoy, a Catholic captain born in Arras.

---

But that is an old story, and today is a day for new ones. The king is dead. Long live the king.

I found De Lannoy in the chapel, as I knew I would. He knelt before the small altar he had built years ago, his fair hair now threaded with grey, his lips moving in prayers I could not hear. Catholic prayers, spoken in Latin, in a Hindu kingdom where he had lived longer than he had ever lived in Europe. The contradictions of his life were written in that small room - the cross above the altar, the oil lamp burning in the corner, the Malayalam inscriptions on the walls.

I waited until he crossed himself and rose. He moved slower than he once had, as if each motion had to be agreed with by old injuries. He was forty-three years old, and the years had not been gentle.

I had learned to wait in this chapel, though the prayers were never mine. The Lutheran boy who had hated Catholics - hated this Catholic in particular, this Frenchman who had sold his sword to heathens - that boy was gone. In his place stood a man who no longer knew what to believe. De Lannoy had kept his faith. I had lost mine somewhere between Colachel and here.

"You heard the guns," he said, flat.

"All of Travancore heard the guns."

"Yes." He moved to the window, looking out at the fort he had built, the walls he had designed, the cannon emplacements I now commanded under his supervision. "I remember when he was young. Marthanda Varma. Before he was king, before he was legend. He was just a prince then, hunted by his own family, fighting for a throne that seemed impossible to claim."

"You helped him claim it."

"I helped him build an army. He claimed the throne himself." De Lannoy's voice was soft, distant. "He was not a kind man. He was not even a good man, by most measures. He killed his enemies without mercy. He broke the old families that had ruled these lands for centuries. He did things that would damn him in any church I know."

"And yet?"

"And yet he built something. Something that will outlast all of us." De Lannoy turned to face me. His eyes, pale blue faded almost to grey, held mine. "Do you know what he said when I married Margaret? When the English Company's factor at Anchuthengu called her a native's whore and refused to trade with a man who had 'gone local'?"

I shook my head. I had heard rumours, but never the story from De Lannoy himself.

"He wanted to burn the factory. March north with two thousand men and teach the English Company's factor at Anchuthengu what it meant to insult his officer's wife." De Lannoy's voice was soft, almost wondering. "His ministers talked him down. Barely. But he would have done it, Pieter. He would have started a war with the English for my honour." He paused. "What king does that for a foreign mercenary?"

"One who understood loyalty."

"One who understood that his officers were his. Not Dutch, not Portuguese, not Flemish. His." De Lannoy looked back at the window. "That is what matters in the end. Not whether we were good or kind or merciful. Whether we built something that endures. Whether we made men believe they belonged to something worth dying for."

I thought about that. I was thirty-three years old, no longer young, not yet old. I had a wife and three children. I had a rank and a purpose. I had a life in this strange green land that was nothing like the life I had imagined when I was a boy in Batavia.

"What happens now?" I asked.

"Now? Now the nephew becomes king. Dharma Raja, they will call him. He is not his uncle - he is scholarly, pious, more interested in temples than in wars. But perhaps that is what Travancore needs. His uncle built the walls. Perhaps the nephew can fill them with something worth defending."

---

The coronation came a week later.

I spent the morning inspecting the ceremonial battery - twelve guns that would fire the royal salute. A young gunner had packed the charges too tight, and I made him redo them twice until the powder sat right. He looked at me with resentment, but he would thank me later. A misfire during a coronation salute was the kind of mistake that ended careers.

When the ceremony began, I watched from the edges of the crowd, one more soldier in a sea of soldiers, as Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma was crowned Dharma Raja of Travancore. The ceremonies were elaborate, ancient, conducted by priests who chanted in Sanskrit while elephants swayed and drums thundered and the nobility of the kingdom prostrated themselves before their new master.

He was younger than I expected - perhaps thirty, with a scholar's soft hands and a contemplative expression that seemed out of place amid all the martial splendor. When he spoke, his voice was quiet, almost gentle. He spoke of dharma, of righteousness, of the duty a king owes to his people. He did not speak of war or conquest or the enemies who ringed Travancore on every side.

"He is not a warrior," I said to De Lannoy, who stood beside me.

"No. He is something else." De Lannoy's expression was unreadable. "His uncle was a sword. Perhaps the nephew is meant to be a shield."

"Can a shield hold against what is coming?"

De Lannoy did not answer. But I saw his eyes drift northward, toward the mountains that separated Travancore from the kingdoms beyond. Somewhere beyond those mountains, a soldier named Hyder Ali was building an army unlike anything India had ever seen.

The old king was dead. The new king was crowned. And the world was changing in ways none of us fully understood.

---

That night, I returned to my quarters in the fort and found my wife waiting for me.

Lakshmi was Nair, from a family that had served Travancore for generations. We had been married for twelve years, against the wishes of her family and the raised eyebrows of the Dutch community that no longer existed. She had given me three children - two boys and a girl - and she had given me something more valuable than children: a reason to stay.

"You have been with De Lannoy," she said. She always knew.

"The king is dead. We were... remembering."

"Remembering." She handed me a cup of something warm - rice water flavoured with ginger, a southern remedy for troubled minds. "You Dutch remember too much. Always looking backward, never forward."

"I am not Dutch anymore."

"You are not Travancorean either." Her voice was gentle, not accusing. We had had this conversation many times, in many forms. "You are something in between. Like our children."

I looked toward the room where the children slept. Willem, the eldest, was eleven now - old enough to begin training, old enough to ask questions about his father's past that made my mouth go dry. Anna was eight, with her mother's dark eyes and her father's restless curiosity. Little Thomas was five, too young to understand anything except that his father sometimes looked sad for reasons he could not explain.

"What will happen to them?" I asked. "When we are gone, when De Lannoy is gone, when there is no one left who remembers what we were?"

"They will become what they become. Just as you did. Just as everyone does." Lakshmi sat beside me, her warmth familiar and comforting. "You think too much, husband. The king is dead. Another king has taken his place. The sun will rise tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that. The world goes on."

"The world is changing."

"The world is always changing. That does not mean we must change with it."

But we do, I thought. We change whether we want to or not. Travancore had changed me from a Dutch soldier into whatever I was now - not Dutch, not Travancorean, something that had no name in any language I knew. My children would change into something else again, something even further from what I had been.

Was that loss? Or was it simply the way of things?

I did not know. I am not sure I know even now.

*The king was dead. I had served him for seventeen years without ever speaking to him, and now he was gone, and another man sat on his throne.*

*I did not know then what was coming. None of us did. We thought the wars were over, the kingdom secure, the future assured. We did not know about Hyder Ali's rockets or Tipu's dreams of conquest. We did not know that the walls we had built would be tested as they had never been tested before.*

*We knew only that an era had ended, and another was beginning. We knew only that we were caught between what we had been and what we might become.*

*Travancore takes what it needs, De Lannoy had told me once. It had taken him, a Dutch commander who became a Travancorean legend. It had taken me, a captured boy who became an artillery officer with a Nair wife and mixed-blood children.*

*What would it take next? What would it make of us?*

*I did not know. But standing on the walls of Udayagiri, watching the smoke from the funeral pyres drift across the sky, I sensed that the answer would not be gentle.*

*The old king was dead. The new age was beginning.*

*God help us all.*

# Chapter 2: Smoke at Colachel

Salt wind always carries a warning.

The men who had grown up in Batavia's humid heat did not know that. They complained about the grit in their teeth and the way the sea air made the powder go sour if you were careless. They cursed the palms and the glare and the strange green coast that refused to look like the Indies they thought they understood.

The older soldiers from Zeeland and Amsterdam knew better. They tasted that wind and kept their mouths shut. A sea that smells of iron and rotting weed is a sea that has watched too many men die.

I was sixteen years old and did not yet know how to read weather properly. I learned at Colachel.

---

We camped on sand that never cooled.

The day before the battle, we had dragged our guns into position by sweating oxen and sweating men, ropes cutting into palms, wheels sinking and jerking as if the earth itself resisted our arrogance. The officers shouted in Dutch and bad Portuguese. The sepoys answered in languages I did not recognise. Somewhere beyond them, in the palm shadow, local guides watched with eyes like shutters.

Our expedition had come from Ceylon with confidence packed into every crate. We had sailed down with orders, silver, and the certainty that the petty kingdoms of the Malabar coast would fold the way they always folded when a European company pressed hard enough. We had a governor's signature. We had a factor's promises. We had cannon, disciplined infantry, and a commander who had fought in Europe.

That commander was Eustachius De Lannoy.

Even then he did not belong among us.

He spoke Dutch with a Walloon drawl that stretched vowels and softened consonants until the language sounded foreign in his mouth. The Zeelanders winced when he gave orders. The men from Amsterdam called him "the Frenchman" as if it were a curse, though he was Flemish and would correct them coldly when he heard it. He crossed himself before meals. He kept a small rosary hidden in his coat and pretended not to know that the other officers laughed about it when he was out of earshot.

In the Company, a Catholic could rise if he was useful. He could command if he won. But he would never be invited fully into the room. The wars of religion were a century past, but the hatred lingered like smoke in old cloth.

I had been taught to distrust men like him. My father had been a trader, my mother a woman whose ancestry was spoken of only in hints, and in our household Lutheran certainty had been one of the few clean lines. Catholics were the enemy in Europe, the corruptors of the Portuguese and Spanish, the men who brought priests into trade the way a surgeon brings a knife into flesh.

When De Lannoy inspected our guns, I watched him the way you watch a loose rope in a storm. Useful until it snaps, and then fatal.

He paused by my gun that afternoon, a six-pounder mounted on a creaking carriage. I was the youngest on the crew, small enough to crawl where older men could not, quick enough to move powder and shot without needing to be kicked.

"You," he said, pointing with his riding crop.

I stiffened, waiting to be blamed for something. Part of me hoped he would give me a reason to hate him more openly.

"What is the range at two degrees elevation, standard charge, with this bore and barrel length?" he asked, as if we were in a classroom rather than a war camp.

I blinked. The other men shifted, impatient. I knew how to load, how to swab, how to stand clear of the recoil. I did not know the mathematics.

"I do not know, sir," I said.

His eyes narrowed. Not anger. Calculation. The same look a merchant gives a bolt of cloth, assessing worth.

"Six hundred yards," he said. "Give or take for wind and powder quality. You should know that. Every man on a gun crew should know the numbers, not just the motions." He tapped the barrel with his crop. "War is arithmetic. The rest is noise."

Then he moved on, leaving me with the taste of shame and salt. I told myself his accent made him sound like a schoolmaster, and that schoolmasters were not to be respected. It was a child's thought. I was a child.

That night I lay awake under a canvas that stank of damp and old sweat. I listened to the sea and told myself the next day would be like the drills. We would form, fire, advance, and the locals would run. I told myself the Company did not lose to men in cotton and bare feet.

In the morning, the cannons taught me humility.

---

At dawn the coastline looked almost gentle.

Mist lay over the palms. The sea was a dull pewter, ruffled by wind that tugged at flags and turned the campfires into ribbons of smoke. Our men stood in line, bayonets fixed, coats already stained with sweat. The guns were loaded. The powder casks were covered with cloth to keep the damp out. Drummers beat a steady rhythm that made the heart believe in order.

De Lannoy rode along the line once, slow, his expression unreadable. He did not give a speech. He did not promise glory. He only pointed with his crop and adjusted distances, shifting a gun a foot to the left, moving a squad half a pace back as if he could see the battle already and was correcting it before it happened.

Ahead, beyond the dunes, the Travancorean line formed.

They did not look like the scattered levies our factors had described. They were not a handful of spear men trembling behind palm trunks. They came in blocks, ranks deep, matchlocks and muskets held with practised hands. Their flags moved above them, bright against the grey morning. Between their infantry, I saw guns, more than we had expected, their barrels catching the first light.

The first time I heard their drums, I understood we were not the only ones who believed in order.

Someone near me muttered a prayer. It might have been Catholic. It might have been Lutheran. In the mouth of a frightened man, the difference does not matter.

The Travancorean guns spoke first.

There was no formal challenge, no polite exchange of opening volleys the way European manuals pretended war should begin. One moment the morning was full of wind and drumbeats, the next it was full of iron.

The ball that took the head off the man two places to my left made a sound I have never forgotten. It was not a heroic sound. It was a wet crack, like a ripe fruit smashed on stone, followed by a spray that painted the sand dark.

Men screamed. Drummers stumbled. Someone dropped his match.

We fired back.

Our guns roared, and for a moment I felt relief. The familiar recoil, the smoke, the way the barrel jumped and settled. The world narrowing to a simple sequence: sponge, load, ram, prime, fire. Arithmetic. Noise.

Then their second volley came in and tore through our line again.

The Travancorean gunners did not fire wildly. They fired with purpose. They had ranges. They had angles. They had officers who knew what they were doing. Through the smoke, I caught glimpses of their crews - swabbing, loading, ramming, priming - and they moved faster than we did. Someone had drilled them. Someone had taught them the arithmetic.

I thought of De Lannoy's question, his calm voice reciting numbers I had not bothered to learn. Six hundred yards. The Travancorean guns were hitting us from further than that.

One of our guns took a hit on the carriage and flipped sideways, the barrel rolling in the sand like a dead animal. The crew scattered. A man tried to grab the trail and was crushed under the wheel.

Our infantry tried to advance, bayonets out, a square of disciplined cloth marching into smoke.

The smoke thickened until I could barely see the next gun.

Orders became fragments. "Hold." "Forward." "Reload." "Jesus." "Godverdomme."

The sea vanished behind a curtain of powder. The palms became ghosts. The air tasted of sulphur and salt and panic.

I ran ammunition until my arms shook.

Shot, then powder, then wadding. I counted the steps between the powder cask and the gun because counting gave the mind something to cling to.

On the third run, I slipped in blood and fell hard on my knees. The sand was warm. The blood was warmer.

I looked up and saw De Lannoy through the smoke.

He was on foot now, his horse gone, his coat torn at the sleeve. He stood near the centre of the line, shouting orders that were swallowed by cannon thunder. He pointed, corrected, rallied. He moved like a man trying to hold back a tide with his hands.

For the first time, I saw fear on his face.

Not cowardice. Not panic. Fear as information. Fear as recognition.

This was a battle we could lose.

And in that moment, blood on my hands and sand in my teeth, I hated him. Hated the papist who had led us here. Hated the Frenchman whose arithmetic had failed. I did not yet understand that the failure was not his, that no amount of calculation could have saved us from our own arrogance. I only knew that a Catholic had brought good Lutheran boys to die on a heathen beach, and that felt like reason enough for hatred.

---

It ended the way most battles end.

Not with a clean moment of decision, not with a flag lowered and a formal surrender. It ended with collapse.

Our left flank buckled first. Travancorean cavalry, light and fast, appeared out of the smoke and cut into men who could not see them until steel was already inside the ribs. Our infantry tried to turn and present bayonets, but turning under fire is never orderly. A line becomes a knot. A knot becomes a rout.

Someone shouted to fall back.

Someone shouted to stand.

Men did both, and in doing both they did neither.

I remember a face, a boy like me, eyes wide behind powder-black lashes, his mouth opening to speak. A ball took him mid-sentence and threw him backwards as if he was a doll.

I remember the smell of burning coir as a hut caught fire near the dunes.

I remember stumbling over a body and realising it was still warm, still moving, still trying to breathe with half a chest.

Then I remember pain.

It was a hard, blunt pain in my side, like being hit by a club. I looked down and saw blood soaking my coat. I had not even heard the shot that found me. That is how battle teaches you your own smallness. It does not announce itself. It simply takes.

I tried to keep moving. My legs obeyed for a few steps, then did not.

The sand rose to meet me.

Somewhere above, men ran. Feet thudded. A horse screamed. The world shook with cannon fire.

I lay on my back and watched smoke drift across the sky, grey on grey. A palm frond fluttered like a torn flag.

I thought of Batavia, of canals and tiled roofs I had never seen, of my mother humming in a language that was not Dutch. The memory felt like someone else's life.

Then a shadow fell across me.

I tried to raise my knife. My hand moved an inch and stopped.

A man stood over me with a curved sword and a cloth wrapped around his head. His skin was dark, his eyes brighter than the morning. He looked at me with something like disgust, then spat beside my head.

He said something in Malayalam. I did not understand the words. I understood the tone.

Two more men came. They hauled me up by the shoulders and dragged me toward the rear, my boots leaving furrows in the sand. Each jolt sent fire through my side. I bit down on my tongue until I tasted blood and metal.

We passed bodies. Dutch bodies. Travancorean bodies. Men were equal in death, lined up on the same sand.

As they dragged me, I saw De Lannoy again.

He was on his knees in the sand, hands bound, his face smeared with soot. A Travancorean officer stood behind him, speaking calmly, as if they were discussing trade rather than defeat. De Lannoy's jaw was clenched. His eyes were fixed on the horizon, where Dutch ships sat useless in the grey sea.

He did not look at me.

I hated him for that too. For the battle, for the defeat, for the way he knelt there like a man already calculating his next move while boys like me bled into the sand. The papist. The Frenchman. The traitor who would sell his sword to anyone who paid.

I did not know then that I would become exactly like him.

---

I woke in a room that smelled of damp stone and rotting straw.

For a moment I thought I was in Batavia again, fevered in my mother's arms. Then pain dragged me back. My side throbbed. My mouth was dry. My wrists ached where rope had rubbed them raw.

There were other men in the room, groaning, coughing, praying. The wounded smell of human beings packed together in heat and fear is the same in every prison.

The light came through a small opening high in the wall. Through it I could hear birds, bright and indifferent.

Someone had cleaned the wound and packed it with cloth. Someone had decided I was worth keeping alive.

I did not know why.

Days blurred. They brought rice water and a thin gruel that tasted of smoke. They dragged the worst wounded out and did not bring them back. At night, rats came bold as officers and ran over our legs.

Once, a priest entered. Not a European priest. A Brahmin with ash on his forehead and a voice like dry leaves. He looked at us as if we were cattle. He spoke to a guard, pointed at two men, and those men were taken away.

I did not see them again.

When the door closed, someone began to sob, a low animal sound that made the hair on my arms rise.

I learned to measure time by artillery.

Not battle artillery, but training. Every morning, somewhere above, guns were fired. Not in anger. In drill. The sound was steady, disciplined, intentional. This fort, whoever owned it now, still believed in mathematics.

On the seventh day, the door opened and a familiar voice spoke my name.

"Pieter van der Berg."

I pushed myself up, dizzy, and turned.

De Lannoy stood in the doorway.

He did not wear a Dutch coat. He wore local cloth, but he carried himself with the same straight-backed precision. Two Travancorean soldiers stood behind him. They did not hold him. They guarded him.

For a moment my mind refused to accept what my eyes were telling it.

He looked at the room, at the men, at the blood-stained straw. His face did not soften. Pity was not one of his tools.

His eyes stopped on me.

"Stand," he said.

I tried. My legs shook. I got to my feet anyway, because a boy in the Company learns quickly that you obey officers even when your body argues.

De Lannoy stepped closer. He studied my face as if it was a map.

"You were on the guns," he said.

"Yes, sir."

"You have hands that move quickly, and you count without realising you are counting." His gaze dropped to my fingers. "You will work for me."

The words hit like a second wound.

"Work?" I managed.

"Work," he repeated. "Not chains. Not the rope. Not the knife." His voice lowered, as if the walls might be listening. "Learn, and live. That is the offer. It is the only offer."

Behind him, one of the Travancorean soldiers shifted his spear.

De Lannoy kept his eyes on mine.

"Decide," he said.

My stomach twisted. Pride rose, hot and useless. So did fear, cold and clean.

Outside, a cannon fired, the sound rolling through stone like distant thunder.

I thought of the sand at Colachel, of bodies lined like broken dolls, of the moment the world collapsed into smoke.

I swallowed. My mouth tasted of straw and blood.

"Yes," I said.

De Lannoy nodded, as if confirming a calculation he had already made.

"Good," he replied. "Come."

And I followed the man I had hated - the papist, the Frenchman, the traitor - out of the prison and into the life I did not yet understand.

The Lutheran boy stayed behind in that cell. He died there, I think, with the others who could not bend. What walked out was something else. Something that would learn to sit in a Catholic's chapel, marry a Nair woman, and serve a Hindu king. Something that would forget how to pray in any language.

Something that would become exactly what it had despised.

But that was later. That morning, I only knew that I was alive, and that alive was better than the alternative.

I followed De Lannoy into the sunlight, and I did not look back.


# Chapter 3: The Captive Boy

They moved us before dawn, because men are easier to manage when they cannot see where they are going.

The guards came with lanterns hooded against the rain. They tied our wrists in pairs, not too tight, not too loose. Tight enough to remind us who owned the rope. Loose enough that we could walk without falling and breaking bones they still intended to use.

I went out of the prison with ten other Dutch boys and men. Some were wounded like me, limping, mouths clenched against pain. Others were hollow-eyed from fever. One man coughed constantly, the sound wet and deep, and by the time we reached the yard he was leaving dark flecks on the ground.

The fort smelled different from the prison. Less rot. More oil, more powder. Metal warmed by the day and cooling in the night. Even in the dark, I could hear work: a hammer on iron, a cart wheel creaking, a mule snorting as someone tightened a strap.

War does not end when a battle ends. It changes shape.

---

They took us to the gun park.

I had expected to be sent to fields, to dig, to carry stones. Instead we were marched into a yard where cannon sat in rows like sleeping beasts, their barrels slick with rain, their carriages dark with tar. Men moved among them with lanterns and buckets, wiping, oiling, checking ropes and wedges.

Travancore did not treat guns as trophies. They treated them as tools.

De Lannoy stood under the eaves of a shed, a lantern in one hand, a slate board in the other. He wore local cloth and a light breastplate. A sword hung at his side, not decorative. It looked used.

When he saw us, he did not smile. He did not announce himself. He simply pointed.

"You. You. And you." His crop tapped the air as if selecting barrels. When it pointed at me, the man beside me flinched as if the crop had struck him.

The guards untied the selected men from the chain and pushed us forward.

The rest were marched away toward the inner yard, still linked by rope, their faces turned toward us with a mixture of envy and terror. No one knew what being chosen meant. In prison, any selection can be an execution wearing clean clothes.

De Lannoy looked at me as if my fear was a minor inconvenience.

"Name," he said in Dutch.

"Pieter," I replied.

"Full."

"Pieter van der Berg."

He made a small mark on the slate. "Age."

"Sixteen."

His eyebrows rose slightly, as if confirming his earlier judgement. "Hands."

I held them out. They were scraped and raw. Powder black still clung to the creases of my fingers, as if the battle at Colachel had stained me permanently.

De Lannoy turned to the Travancorean officer beside him and spoke in Malayalam. I did not understand the words, but I understood the tone. Instruction. Assurance. A man used to being obeyed.

Then he looked back at me.

"You will learn gunnery," he said. "If you do not learn, you will die in a place no one will ever name."

It was not a threat. It was a statement of arithmetic.

---

I began at the lowest point.

The first week I did not touch powder. I did not touch shot. I did not even touch a match. My task was water and cloth and oil.

Clean the barrel.

Scrape the vent.

Oil the trunnions.

Check the carriage bolts for rust.

I learned quickly that a gun is not a single object. It is a marriage of wood and iron, of rope and wedge and human hands. A barrel can be perfect and still useless if the carriage is rotten. A crew can be brave and still dead if the vent is fouled and the gun misfires.

De Lannoy moved among us like a man walking through his own thoughts. He did not shout much. When he did, it was because someone was about to die through carelessness.

One morning, a Travancorean gunner tried to light the slow match with his face too close to the vent. De Lannoy hit his wrist with the crop hard enough to make him yelp.

"You want to lose your eyes?" he snapped, then switched into Malayalam, sharp and quick. The gunner shrank, ashamed, rubbing his wrist.

Afterwards De Lannoy did something I did not expect. He took the man's hand and showed him again, slowly, the correct way to hold the match, the correct distance, the angle. Not humiliation. Correction.

I watched and understood something unwillingly.

He did not enjoy power. He used it.

That made him more dangerous than men who shouted for pleasure.

And yet I could not trust the gentleness. Papist gentleness, I thought. The soft voice that hides the Inquisition. My father had told me stories of Catholic mercy - how it always came with conditions, how the hand that healed also held the rack. De Lannoy's patience felt like a trap I could not see the shape of.

---

At night, the prison dreams did not stop.

I still heard the cannon at Colachel. I still saw bodies thrown like sacks. I still tasted sand when I breathed.

Sometimes, in those dreams, De Lannoy was Dutch again. Sometimes he was Travancorean. Sometimes he was neither, only a shadow with a crop pointing at me from the smoke.

In the daylight, I kept my mouth shut.

I answered questions with the smallest number of words possible. I did not join the other gunners when they laughed. I did not accept their offered water when they drank. I pretended I did not understand their Malayalam insults and their sideways glances when my lips moved in Lutheran prayers I no longer believed but could not stop reciting.

I told myself my silence was dignity.

It was also cowardice. Speaking would have meant admitting I belonged here, even as a tool, even as a prisoner with cleaner clothes.

The other Dutch boys who had been selected with me had their own strategies. One tried to ingratiate himself with the Travancoreans by laughing too loudly and praising their king. Another prayed constantly, his lips moving over Lutheran phrases that sounded weak in the tropical air. A third picked fights with local gunners and got beaten for it.

I watched and kept silent.

De Lannoy tolerated all of it, but he did not indulge it.

When the loud boy bowed too low, De Lannoy said, flatly, "A gun does not care who flatters it. It cares who loads it correctly."

When the praying man asked whether God would forgive us for serving heathens, De Lannoy replied, "God forgives sinners who confess. He does not resurrect the careless. Pray if it comforts you, but learn if you wish to live."

When the fighter spat at a Travancorean gunner and called him a savage, De Lannoy had him whipped and then sent him back to the prison chain.

The next morning there was one less Dutch boy in the yard.

The lesson was plain.

De Lannoy was offering survival. He was not offering comfort.

After two weeks, he gave me powder.

He called me to the shed where the powder was kept, dry as a chapel inside. Barrels were stacked in rows. A small lamp burned behind a glass shield, its flame steady, controlled. No open fire. No careless sparks.

De Lannoy stood beside a table with a set of brass measures and a small scale.

"You know numbers," he said.

"I know enough."

"Enough gets men killed." He tapped the scale. "A gun is honest. It gives exactly what you give it. Too much powder and it bursts. Too little and it fails. That is why I like guns. They do not pretend."

He placed a measure in my hand.

"Fill it," he said.

I did, carefully, the fine black grains sliding like sand. My fingers twitched at the smell. Powder smells of danger. It smells of possibility.

De Lannoy watched without blinking.

"Level it," he said.

I took a flat stick and levelled the powder, scraping the excess back into the barrel with slow precision.

He nodded.

"Now weigh it," he said.

I poured it onto the scale pan. The needle dipped, steadied.

De Lannoy leaned in. "Read it."

I read the weight.

"Again," he said.

We did it again. And again. And again, until my hands stopped shaking.

Only when I could fill and level and weigh with the same number each time did he let me step outside with a powder charge and carry it to the gun crew.

The first time the gun fired with a charge I had measured, I felt a strange pride. I had created that thunder with my own hands. I had turned black grains into force.

Then I remembered the headless man at Colachel, and the pride curdled into nausea.

De Lannoy noticed.

He did not comment.

He simply kept teaching.

---

The strangest part of captivity was not the work. It was the moments when I saw the king.

Marthanda Varma came to Udayagiri twice in those early months, riding with a small escort, moving through the fort as if it was an extension of his own body. He was not tall. His face was plain, his eyes unreadable. There was no gold on him, no display, only a sense of coiled authority that made men step aside without thinking.

I watched him from the edge of the yard, hands black with oil, as he spoke with De Lannoy.

The conversation was in Malayalam. I could not understand it. I understood the posture. The king's head slightly inclined, listening. De Lannoy's hands moving in small gestures, describing arcs in the air, pointing to cannon placements, to the wall line, to the sea beyond. The king did not look at us, the Dutch boys, even once.

We were not worth his attention. Or perhaps we were too worth it, and he had learned not to waste emotion on captured enemies.

When he left, the fort exhaled.

One of the Travancorean gunners muttered something about the king's temper and laughed quietly. Another made a gesture of reverence.

De Lannoy watched the king ride away and then looked back at the guns, expression unchanged.

He had been a prisoner once. Now he was advising the man who had captured him.

Travancore did that to people. It swallowed them, digested them, and used what it could.

That should have frightened me more than it did.

---

The first time De Lannoy spoke to me as a person rather than a pair of hands was during rain.

A sudden storm rolled in from the sea and turned the yard into mud. Work continued anyway. The guns had to be covered, the powder moved, the ropes checked. Rain is a weapon in the tropics. It ruins powder, rots wood, sickens men.

I was hauling a canvas over a gun when the rope slipped and burned a line across my palm. I hissed and clenched my fist.

De Lannoy was beside me before I realised he had been watching.

"Open it," he said.

I did.

He took my hand and examined the burn, his touch brisk, professional.

"You will lose skin," he said. "You will not lose function."

Then he did something that made my throat tighten in a way I did not understand. He tore a strip of cloth from his own sleeve and wrapped my palm, tying it with the same care he used when lashing a gun wheel.

"Why?" I heard myself ask.

His eyes lifted to mine. Rain ran down his face. He did not wipe it away.

"Because if you cannot hold a rope you cannot hold a sponge," he said. "And if you cannot hold a sponge you will die when a gun misfires."

It was the practical answer.

But it was not the full answer. I could see that in the steadiness of his gaze.

He let go of my hand.

"You hate me," he said, as if discussing the weather.

I did not reply. Silence had been my armour for weeks.

De Lannoy nodded slightly. "You should. Hatred is clean. It keeps you awake."

He glanced toward the sea, invisible behind sheets of rain.

"But hatred is also heavy," he continued. "If you carry it too long, it will drown you. I have seen men drown on dry land."

He looked back at me.

"Learn, and live," he said. "That is all I offer."

Then he walked away, leaving me standing in the rain with my palm wrapped in his cloth and my mouth full of words I did not want.

That night, when I lay on my pallet, I found myself remembering his earlier question at the gun line.

What is the range at two degrees elevation?

I stared at the darkness until my eyes ached, and I began to calculate.


# Chapter 4: Lessons in Iron

De Lannoy taught with objects first, because objects do not lie.

He took a cannonball the size of a coconut and put it on the table between us. The table was rough teak in a room that smelled of oil and damp paper, set inside the fort above the gun yard. Maps lay rolled in a corner. A slate board leaned against the wall. A quadrant hung from a nail like a priest's instrument.

I had expected punishment for my ignorance. Instead I was given lessons.

De Lannoy tapped the cannonball with one finger.

"This is honest," he said. "It does not care whether you are Dutch or Nair or Maravar. It does not care what god you pray to. It does not care what you believe about honour. It only cares about weight, speed, and angle."

He rolled the ball toward me. It thudded against my palm, heavier than it looked.

"Feel it," he said. "That weight becomes a decision when it leaves the barrel."

I looked at him, uncertain whether this was philosophy or merely another way to tell me to stop being stupid.

De Lannoy took a piece of charcoal and drew a line on the slate.

"If you point the gun straight," he said, drawing a horizontal line, "the ball leaves, drops, and hits the sand in front of you. It is noise and smoke. It frightens men and does nothing."

Then he drew an arc, rising and falling.

"If you lift the barrel," he continued, "the ball travels. It follows this curve, always this curve. It cannot do anything else. Gravity is the king that never dies."

His finger traced the arc again. I found myself following it with my eyes, as if the line could explain the chaos of Colachel.

"So we do not guess," De Lannoy said. "We measure."

He lifted the quadrant from the nail and placed it in my hands.

It was a simple device, brass and wood, with a plumb line and markings cut into the metal. It felt strange to hold something so precise in a fort built of mud and stone and palm timber.

"Angle," he said. "Read it."

I peered at the markings. "Two degrees."

"Again."

I shifted the quadrant slightly. The plumb line swung, settled. "Three."

"Again."

We did it until my eyes stopped watering and my hands stopped shaking.

Outside the window, guns fired on the range. The sound was familiar now. Not the scream of battle, but the steady thunder of work.

De Lannoy watched the plumb line settle and nodded.

"Now you know how to lift a barrel," he said. "You do not yet know what that lift means. That comes next."

---

He gave me numbers as if numbers were food.

Range tables. Powder measures. Shot weights. The width of a barrel. The depth of a vent. The speed of a crew that could fire three rounds a minute versus a crew that could barely manage one.

He made me write them down in Dutch first, because Dutch was the language of my shame and my pride. Then he made me write them again in Malayalam characters, because Malayalam was the language of the fort and the men and the future that would not ask permission.

My hand cramped. My mind protested. I wrote anyway.

Every morning we went to the gun yard. De Lannoy would point at a gun and ask me, without warning, for the elevation at a certain range, the powder charge required in wet weather, the correction for wind from the sea.

When I answered wrong, he did not shout. He had a simpler cruelty.

"Again," he would say.

And we would do it again until I answered right.

The older Travancorean gunners watched with curiosity and amusement. They had expected the Dutch boy to be beaten into obedience. Instead he was being drilled like a recruit, forced to become competent.

Competence, I learned, is its own kind of captivity.

The better I became, the more indispensable I became. The more indispensable I became, the less likely I was to be allowed to leave.

At sixteen, I did not yet have the wisdom to understand that leaving was no longer possible anyway.

---

The first time I truly understood what gunnery was, it happened in silence.

De Lannoy took me to the range behind the fort, a strip of cleared land where targets had been set up at measured distances. Old palm trunks stood at fifty paces, a wall of packed sand at a hundred, a whitewashed board with a red circle at two hundred.

The gun crew waited by a small field piece, a lighter gun than the ones at Colachel, mounted on a carriage that could be moved quickly. The men were barefoot, their clothes damp with sweat, their faces calm.

De Lannoy pointed to the white board with the red circle.

"Two hundred," he said. "Sea wind from the west. Slight damp. Powder is good."

He handed me the quadrant.

My palms were slick. I wiped them on my trousers and tried not to let the gunners see my fear.

I set the quadrant against the breech, watched the plumb line settle.

The numbers came into my head the way prayers once had, without thought. Two degrees, perhaps slightly more. Adjust for wind. Adjust for damp.

I opened my mouth to speak. The words did not come in Dutch. They came in something else, a mixture of Dutch numbers and Malayalam habit, as if my mind had already begun to become the thing it was being trained to become.

"Two and a half," I said finally. "A little more."

De Lannoy did not look at me. He looked at the board.

"Set it," he told the crew.

The gunner adjusted the elevating wedge. The barrel rose slightly, a change so small it looked like nothing.

They loaded. Sponge, powder, wad, shot, wad. The rhythm was almost soothing. A match flared. The gunner stepped back.

De Lannoy raised one hand.

For a moment, everything narrowed.

The gun. The line of sight. The red circle on the board.

Even the birds seemed to pause.

De Lannoy dropped his hand.

The gun fired.

The recoil jumped through the carriage into the earth. Smoke burst outward and then drifted away on the sea wind. The sound hit my chest and made my ribs vibrate.

For a heartbeat, I could see nothing but smoke.

Then the wind tore a hole in it and the board appeared again.

The red circle had a hole through it.

Not perfectly centred, but close enough that the gunners grunted approval.

The world did not cheer. No drums beat. No one shouted.

De Lannoy only nodded.

"That is gunnery," he said quietly. "Not noise. Not bravery. A line and a curve and a man who can make his hands obey his mind."

The crew began to reload without waiting for praise.

My mouth was dry. I tasted powder.

I had put that hole in the red circle with a number spoken aloud.

I had done it without thinking.

The thought should have made me proud.

Instead it made me cold.

At Colachel, men had died because someone like me, somewhere in the Travancorean line, had spoken numbers with calm hands.

Now I was becoming that kind of man.

---

De Lannoy did not allow me to stay in the comfort of abstraction.

A week after the range exercise, he walked me to the magazine.

The powder store sat under thick stone, away from the main barracks. The roof was low. The doors were heavy. The air inside was dry and smelled of sulphur and old wood. Barrels were stacked with careful gaps between them, because fire spreads faster when men are careless with space.

De Lannoy took a small iron scoop from a shelf.

"How much powder is in this barrel?" he asked.

I frowned. "I do not know."

He looked at me, expression flat. "Then you do not know how many shots you can fire. You do not know how many hours you can hold the wall. You do not know when you must stop because bravery will not create powder out of air."

He set the scoop down.

"A fortress is not walls," he said. "A fortress is logistics. It is rice, it is water, it is saltpetre and sulphur. A man who commands guns must command accounts too. Do you understand?"

I did, in a way that made my stomach tighten.

My father had been a Company trader. He had spoken of accounts with boredom. I had thought war was separate from that world.

De Lannoy was telling me the opposite. That war was accounting written in blood.

He walked me through the magazine and made me count. Barrels, weights, storage conditions. He made me write the numbers down. He made me calculate how many rounds each battery could fire before the magazine ran dry.

Halfway through, I heard shouting outside.

De Lannoy stopped, listening.

The shouting grew sharper, urgent. Feet ran past the magazine door. Someone screamed.

De Lannoy's hand went to his sword without drama.

"Come," he said.

We ran into the yard.

A gun crew had made a mistake.

I saw it in the first second, because De Lannoy had already trained my eyes to look for the wrong thing. A powder charge that was too large. A man holding the match too close. A vent that had not been cleared properly.

The gun fired, but not cleanly. The barrel belched smoke and then a crack like a tree splitting. The crew flinched back. One man screamed and clutched his leg, blood pumping between his fingers where iron had torn through his thigh.

The gun did not burst fully. If it had, half the yard would have been flesh and splinters.

De Lannoy moved fast. He was at the gun in two strides, shouting in Malayalam, pushing men back, forcing distance, forcing control.

He grabbed the gunner's injured leg, ripped the man's hand away, and looked at the wound with the same calm he had used on my rope burn.

"Pressure," he snapped.

Someone wrapped cloth around the leg. Someone else brought water.

De Lannoy turned to the rest of the crew.

His voice was quiet now, which was worse than shouting.

"Who measured the charge?" he asked.

The men looked down. No one answered.

De Lannoy's gaze swept them like a gun barrel.

"Who?" he repeated.

A boy stepped forward. Younger than me. His eyes were wide with terror.

De Lannoy looked at him for a long moment. Then he did not strike him. He did not shout. He did something more precise.

He made the boy pick up the broken iron fragment that had torn the gunner's arm.

The boy's hands shook as he held it.

"Carry that," De Lannoy said, "until you can feel its weight in your sleep. Carry it until you never forget that iron does not forgive."

Then he turned away and called for the gun to be taken out of service.

The yard went quiet.

I stood with my throat tight, watching blood drip into the mud.

De Lannoy looked at me.

"You see now," he said.

I nodded, unable to speak.

"Good," he replied. "Remember it. Discipline is not ceremony. It is survival."

---

That evening, as the rain cooled the stones and the fort settled into night, De Lannoy called me back to his room.

He had laid out three objects on the table: a cannonball, a handful of powder grains in a small dish, and a small wooden horse carved roughly, the kind a child might play with.

"Artillery," he said, touching the ball. "Infantry," he said, touching the powder grains. "Cavalry," he said, touching the horse.

He pushed the cannonball forward so it rolled across the table and knocked the wooden horse onto its side.

"Artillery decides battles," he said. "It breaks formations. It makes brave men into meat."

He scattered the powder grains with his fingertips.

"Infantry holds ground," he continued. "Not because it is glorious. Because someone has to stand when the world is trying to move you."

Then he stood the wooden horse upright again and rolled it forward.

"Cavalry exploits," he finished. "It moves where the break is. It turns a crack into a collapse."

He looked up at me. His eyes were tired.

"Remember the order," he said.

I stared at the table, at the objects now rearranged by his hands.

It was so simple. Too simple. Colachel had been chaos and smoke and screaming horses. Yet here, on a table, it became something that could be understood.

That was De Lannoy's gift.

He could look at war and see structure.

He could teach structure to a boy who had thought war was only noise.

As I left his room, the smell of powder still in my nose, I realised I had not thought about escape all day.

I had thought about angles.

That was the most frightening transformation of all.

# Chapter 5: Lakshmi

I did not marry for love at first.

That is a hard thing to admit, because it makes the heart sound like an account book. But I was a man trained by a company that believed everything could be measured, and I had been remade by a kingdom that believed everything could be used. I learned early that survival has its own kinds of intimacy.

When Lakshmi entered my life, I noticed her the way I noticed a new battery on the wall. Not with romance, but with attention. Something had changed in the fort's pattern, and a man who lives by pattern learns to look closely.

---

I first saw her in the gun yard after a mistake.

It was not my mistake. It belonged to a boy who had been too eager to prove himself and too careless with powder. The gun had cracked, the crew had scattered, and a man had left the yard with his arm wrapped in cloth soaked through with blood.

The injured gunner's name was Kelu. He was a Nair like most of the fort's soldiers, quick-tempered and proud. I had never spoken to him beyond the words of drill. He was one of the men who watched me with narrowed eyes, who never laughed when the other gunners joked about my accent.

When the gun cracked, Kelu did not run. He grabbed the trail as if his body could hold iron steady. The recoil tore him anyway. He screamed once, loud enough to silence the whole yard, and then clamped his teeth together so his pride would not spill out again.

They carried him to a small room near the magazine, where injuries were cleaned if the gods were kind and men died if they were not.

De Lannoy put me back to work immediately. He always did. When blood is on the ground, the first duty is to make sure there is no more.

"Cover the powder," he snapped in Malayalam. "Move the barrels. Check the vents. Now."

I obeyed, hands moving fast, mind running ahead through consequences. If the cracked gun had thrown sparks into the open charges, the yard would have become a butcher's stall.

When the danger was contained, I went to the doorway of the injury room, drawn by a sound I did not recognise at first.

It was not prayer. It was not sobbing. It was not the low animal moan men make when pain has hollowed them out.

It was singing.

Low, rhythmic, almost a murmur. A woman's voice, steady as a drumbeat, cutting through the stink of blood and sweat.

Inside, Lakshmi knelt beside Kelu.

She was washing his wound with boiled water that had cooled enough not to scald. Her hands were quick and sure. She did not flinch when Kelu jerked. She did not scold him. She simply held his forearm with one hand and poured with the other, and kept singing under her breath as if the song was a rope that could keep a man from falling into the dark.

Kelu's face was grey with pain. When she looked up at him, he swallowed hard and blinked, like a boy pretending he had not nearly died.

She spoke to him in a tone I had never heard in the fort. Not an officer's command. Not a man's brag. Not a priest's instruction.

A mother's tone.

Kelu muttered something, bitter. I caught only one word: *Parangi*.

Foreigner.

Lakshmi's eyes flicked toward the doorway.

They found me at once.

I had learned not to meet men's eyes too directly. In the Company that could be read as insolence, and in Travancore it could be read as challenge. But Lakshmi did not have a soldier's habit of avoiding what was in front of her. Her gaze held mine with unembarrassed clarity.

Her forehead had a small mark of sandal paste. Her hair was oiled and braided, the braid looped over her shoulder. Her blouse was plain, her sari darkened by rain and work. She wore no jewellery except a thin chain around her neck and a pair of brass bangles that clicked softly as she moved.

In that moment she looked at me the way De Lannoy looked at a gun.

Not judgment. Assessment.

She said something to Kelu, sharp enough that he shut his mouth. Then she returned her attention to the wound, still singing.

I stood at the doorway longer than I should have, ashamed of my own curiosity. Then I turned and went back to the yard.

For the rest of the day, the singing stayed in my head.

---

After that, I saw her everywhere.

Not because she had suddenly become important to the fort, but because my eyes had learned to find her. She came with baskets of bandages and small jars of ointment. She came when a fever swept through the barracks after the rains. She came when a man's hand was crushed by a wheel, when a boy burned his fingers on a match, when an officer's wife gave birth too early and there was nothing to be done but hold the infant and wait for the tiny chest to stop moving.

She did not belong to the fort. She was not a soldier's wife, not yet. She was from a Nair household in the villages near Udayagiri, a family that supplied rice and coconut oil and men for the king's service. Her uncle had a minor post in the fort administration. Her brother, Kelu, served on the guns.

That is how she arrived, through blood and duty, not through romance.

I began to learn her habits.

She never walked quickly unless someone was dying. She never wasted words on men who wanted pity. She used humour the way a surgeon uses a blade, sparingly and only when it would do more good than harm. When the fort's gossip women whispered that she was too bold, she let them whisper and kept working.

Once, when a young gunner tried to flirt with her in crude Malayalam, she flicked his ear hard enough to make him yelp, then handed him a bucket and told him to scrub the floor where men had vomited. The other gunners laughed. The young gunner blushed and scrubbed.

I watched and found myself almost smiling.

It frightened me. Smiling had been rare since Colachel.

---

We did not speak properly for months.

My Malayalam was still clumsy, full of Dutch angles. Lakshmi understood my words but pretended not to when she wanted to punish my pride. If I asked for water, she would hand me a cloth and tell me to wipe my own sweat first. If I tried to thank her, she would tilt her head and ask, too sweetly, whether foreign tongues had no better phrases.

When she spoke Dutch, it was worse. Her mouth refused the hard consonants. She made the words sound like they had been softened in water.

"Pieter," she would say, and it would come out like "Pitar".

The other gunners mocked me for it. Lakshmi ignored them.

One afternoon, after drill, I found her alone in the shade by the well, washing blood from cloth. The water turned pink and then clear again as she wrung and rinsed and wrung.

I hesitated at the edge of the shade, unsure whether approaching her would be another kind of arrogance.

Lakshmi glanced up. "If you have come to stare, stare properly," she said. "Do not hover like a guilty dog."

The words stung. The tone made them bearable.

I stepped closer.

She dipped the cloth again and wrung it out. "You load a gun like a man who has decided he will not die," she said without looking at me.

The words snagged in my chest. I watched the pink water spiral in the bucket and said the first honest thing that came.

"I have already died once," I said. "At Colachel."

Lakshmi looked up then, and for a moment the fort disappeared. There was only her gaze and the wet cloth in her hands and the sound of the well rope creaking.

"Men who die once die twice," she said. "The first time in battle, the second time when they stop living."

It was not a proverb I had heard before. It might have been one she invented on the spot. Lakshmi was capable of that. She could make wisdom the way she made bandages, out of what was available.

"Are you living, Pieter?" she asked.

The question landed harder than it should have. It forced my mind away from numbers and powder tables and back into the raw, unfinished parts of myself.

My mouth opened and nothing came. Lakshmi shrugged, as if the silence was answer enough.

She went back to washing.

I stood beside her and, without thinking, reached for one of the cloths and began to wring it out.

Lakshmi's eyes flicked to my hands.

"Foreign hands are useful too," she said.

That was the first kindness she ever gave me, and she disguised it as an insult.

I understood then that I would not survive this land by becoming local. I would survive it by being useful, by learning its rhythms, by letting it reshape me without surrendering entirely.

Lakshmi understood that before I did.

---

The marriage did not begin with a proposal. It began with a negotiation.

It came to me through De Lannoy, as most important things in my life did.

He called me to his room one evening when the monsoon clouds sat low and the fort smelled of damp stone. He did not offer toddy. When De Lannoy did not offer toddy, it meant the conversation was not friendly.

"You need roots," he said.

I stared at him. "I have a gun crew."

De Lannoy's expression did not change. "You have a gun crew today. Tomorrow you have a different crew. Men die. Men transfer. Men betray. Roots are not soldiers."

"What are roots, then?" I asked, irritated.

De Lannoy picked up a small paper from his desk and slid it toward me.

It was written in Malayalam, with a few Dutch names inserted like foreign bodies in a wound.

I recognised my own name.

"You have been here five years," De Lannoy said. "You are useful. The king will not kill you. That does not mean this land will accept you. Not fully."

His finger tapped the paper.

"There are men in the court who believe you remain a danger because you have no ties. No family, no house, no obligations that can be used to keep you in line. A foreign gunner with no chains is still a foreign gunner."

I felt my mouth go dry. "So they want to put me in chains."

De Lannoy nodded. "Yes. Softer chains."

I looked down at the paper again. "What is this?"

"A marriage offer," De Lannoy said.

I looked up sharply. "To whom?"

De Lannoy's eyes were flat. "Lakshmi."

The name hit me like a cannon recoil. Not because I had been secretly dreaming of her, but because I had not allowed myself to imagine she could belong to me. Lakshmi was local in a way I would never be. She walked into the fort without fear. She spoke to men like they were children and made them obey. She carried herself as if she had always belonged here.

I was still a Dutch boy in my head, smelling salt wind and smoke.

"Her family will never accept it," I said immediately.

"Her family has already been speaking to Ramayyan," De Lannoy replied. "They accept it enough to consider it."

That should have been comforting. It was not. It made the offer feel less like romance and more like strategy.

"And what do they want in return?" I asked.

De Lannoy gave a small, almost invisible smile. "They want you to convert."

There it was. The price.

I felt something hot rise in my chest. Anger, yes. Also fear. Also the old stubborn pride of a boy who had nothing left except the last few things he could still refuse.

"No," I said.

De Lannoy watched me. "You are Lutheran. Is that still true?"

The question was not about doctrine. It was about identity.

I traced the cross on my chest when afraid. The prayers no longer came easily. The fort smelled of oil and damp paper, not churches and candles.

"I do not know what I am," I said.

De Lannoy nodded. "Good. That is honest."

He leaned forward slightly. "But you know what you are not. You are not Hindu. Do not become Hindu on paper because a family wants a clean story. Clean stories are for priests. Soldiers live in mud."

I stared at him. De Lannoy was Catholic. He had kept his chapel and his Latin and his rosary in a king's fort. He understood the stubbornness of faith even when faith was frayed.

"If I refuse," I said, "the marriage is dead."

"Not necessarily," De Lannoy replied. "Lakshmi is not her uncle. She is not her priest. She is herself."

His voice softened, just a fraction.

"Go and speak to her," he said. "Not like an officer. Like a man."

---

I found Lakshmi by the well again, because the well was where the fort's masks came off. Men who swaggered on the wall came to the well to drink like animals. Women who watched their mouths in halls came to the well to mutter truths into water.

Lakshmi was tying up bundles of cloth, her hands moving quick and efficient. She glanced up when I approached.

"If you have come to bleed, do it somewhere else," she said.

I swallowed. My tongue felt thick.

"I have come because De Lannoy sent me," I said.

Lakshmi's hands paused. Her eyes narrowed slightly. "So. It is time."

The directness made me dizzy.

"You know?" I asked.

Lakshmi tied the last knot and set the bundle down. "The fort gossips as well as it drills," she said. "Yes, I know. My uncle thinks it will make our family safer. The priests think it will make my household cleaner. Your Dutch pride thinks it will make you less foreign."

She stepped closer, close enough that I could smell the coconut oil in her hair.

"I do not care what they think," she said.

The words should have been reassuring. They were not. They sounded like a blade being drawn.

"What do you care about?" I asked.

Lakshmi looked at my face as if reading it. Then her gaze dropped to my hands, the calluses from rope and iron, the powder stains that never fully washed out.

"I care that you do not lie," she said. "If you marry me and pretend to be Hindu, you will be lying every day. You will be lying to my mother, to my gods, to your own ghosts. And you will resent me for it."

I felt the truth of it settle in my bones.

"I will not convert," I said.

Lakshmi nodded. "Good."

I blinked, surprised. "Good?"

"Good," she repeated. "Let them be angry. Anger is honest. Better than pretending."

She picked up the bundle again and started walking toward the infirmary.

I followed without thinking. "Then why marry me?"

Lakshmi did not look back. "Because I have watched you for years," she said. "I have watched you become useful. I have watched you stop flinching when men call you *Parangi*. I have watched you measure powder like prayer. I have watched you carry wounded men without making speeches about mercy."

She paused at the doorway and finally looked at me.

"And I have watched you be alone," she said. "Alone is a dangerous way to live. Alone men break. Alone men become cruel."

The words landed softly and still hurt.

"If you marry me," Lakshmi continued, "you will not be alone. You will be something else. Not Dutch. Not Nair. Something that will make everyone uncomfortable."

Her mouth tightened. It might have been amusement.

"That suits me," she said.

---

The ceremony was small, because large ceremonies are for people who belong.

Lakshmi's uncle wanted Brahmin priests. The priests wanted me to take a Hindu name and submit to the rituals of cleansing. De Lannoy wanted to laugh at them all and drink toddy in his chapel.

In the end it was Lakshmi who decided.

We stood in her family's courtyard under a grey morning sky. A lamp burned in a niche. A few elders watched with faces set hard against disapproval. Kelu stood nearby, his arm still stiff, his eyes unreadable.

I had expected him to object. He had called me *Parangi* with contempt. He had watched me in the gun yard with the suspicion men reserve for dogs that might bite. But when Lakshmi told him she would marry me, he had said only: "You have decided." Not a question. Not approval. Just acknowledgment that his sister was not a woman who could be told what to do.

Now he stood at the edge of the courtyard, neither blessing nor cursing. His silence was the closest thing to acceptance I would receive from her blood.

Lakshmi's mother did not speak to me. She looked past me as if I was a pole holding up a roof.

Lakshmi, however, looked at me as if she had chosen me deliberately.

An elder woman placed a cloth in Lakshmi's hands and another in mine. There were words spoken, not Sanskrit, not Dutch, but Malayalam, practical and direct. Promises, obligations, warnings. No one pretended it was pure. No one pretended it was blessed by every god in the land.

Lakshmi's uncle muttered that the priests would not approve. Lakshmi replied, calmly, that priests approve of whatever keeps them fed.

I did not understand every word, but I understood enough.

At the end, Lakshmi took my hand.

Her fingers were warm and dry. Not a soldier's hand. Not soft either. A hand that had wrung blood from cloth and held feverish children and steadied men who wanted to die.

She squeezed once.

That was our marriage.

No conversion. No new name. No cleansing.

Only a decision made in full knowledge of what it would cost.

---

The first weeks after, the fort watched us the way it watched the sea.

Some men were openly contemptuous. A Dutch gunner with a Nair wife, as if the world had turned upside down. Some women whispered that Lakshmi had ruined herself. Some priests refused to take offerings from our household. Some officers smiled too politely.

De Lannoy treated it as nothing. He continued to drill my crew. He continued to punish carelessness. He continued to pray in his chapel as if the world could talk itself hoarse outside the door.

One evening, after drill, he found me standing by the wall staring out at the wet green hills.

"Do you regret it?" he asked.

I saw Lakshmi in our small house near the fort, lighting a lamp, humming under her breath as she boiled rice for our evening meal. Her voice cut through pain and made men listen.

"No," I said.

De Lannoy nodded. "Good. Do not seek forgiveness, Pieter. Seek usefulness. Forgiveness is for priests. Usefulness keeps walls standing."

He walked away, leaving me with the sound of his boots on stone.

That night, Lakshmi sat beside me and spoke of nothing important. The price of rice. The new boy in the gun crew who could not count. Kelu's stubborn refusal to rest his arm.

In the middle of it, she reached up and touched my chest, where a cross hung under my shirt.

Her fingers paused, gentle.

"Does your god mind?" she asked.

I opened my mouth and realised I did not have an answer.

Lakshmi's hand dropped.

"Mine do not mind," she said. "They have seen worse men than you."

It was the closest thing to blessing I had ever been given.

In the weeks that followed, I found myself still tracing the cross when afraid, but with less desperation. The gesture no longer felt like a plea for rescue. It felt like a memory of who I had been, carried quietly into the person I was becoming.

Lakshmi did not ask me to stop.

She only asked me not to lie.

That was the first real vow I ever learned how to keep.

# Chapter 6: The New King

A king's first weakness is always hope.

Hope makes men believe the future will be kinder than the past. It makes them forget that kingdoms do not care about goodness. They care about force, food, and the patience to outlast the next famine or invasion.

When Dharma Raja took the throne, the court was full of hope.

I watched it spread through the palace like perfume, sweet and unnecessary. Men who had feared Marthanda Varma's temper began to speak more loudly. Priests who had been careful with their words began to advise more boldly. Old families who had bowed and swallowed their hatred began to smile as if time itself had joined their side.

The guns on the wall did not care.

---

The first time I stood in Dharma Raja's presence properly, it was not at the coronation. It was in a smaller room, quieter, where decisions were made without drums.

The audience chamber smelled of sandalwood and warm oil lamps. The ceiling was low for a palace, carved beams dark with age, so the air held every whisper. A curtain hung over the doorway, thick cloth embroidered with gold thread that caught the lamplight and turned it into small fires.

Dharma Raja sat on a simple wooden seat with a cloth draped over it. There were no jewels on his hands. No sword at his hip. A scholar's posture, straight but not rigid. His eyes moved through the room with the careful attention of a man used to reading palm-leaf manuscripts.

De Lannoy stood to one side, close enough to be useful, far enough not to contaminate the sanctity of the moment. He wore his usual plain coat and carried himself like a man in uniform even when dressed in cloth. The cross he wore under his shirt was invisible, but I had learned that invisible things can still shape a room.

I stood behind De Lannoy, hands at my sides, trying to look like an officer and not like a captured boy who had learned to count.

A minister spoke first, listing problems in the smooth tone of a man who has never been shot at. Grain stores. Temple repairs. A dispute between two nobles about land rights. Complaints from merchants about duties.

Dharma Raja listened without interrupting. When the minister paused, the king asked a small question about numbers. How much rice had been stored in the last harvest. How much had been distributed during the rains. How much silver had been diverted to repair a temple roof.

The minister answered quickly, but the speed had a nervousness to it. Marthanda Varma had punished incompetence with violence. Dharma Raja punished it with attention.

Then Dharma Raja's gaze shifted to De Lannoy.

"How many guns at Udayagiri?" he asked in Malayalam.

De Lannoy answered without hesitation. The number, the calibre, the condition of carriages, the state of powder. His Malayalam was fluent, but his accent remained, a faint roughness in the vowels that reminded everyone he had once been an enemy.

Dharma Raja listened, then looked at me.

For a heartbeat, I felt the old instinct to lower my eyes. In the Company, you do not meet the gaze of men above you unless ordered. In Travancore, you do not meet the gaze of a king unless you want to be remembered.

But Dharma Raja's eyes held mine with calm curiosity.

"You are Pieter," he said.

The sound of my name in his mouth was strange. It made me feel briefly, absurdly, as if I had been recognised as a human being rather than a tool.

"Yes, Your Highness," I replied, in Malayalam.

The king's eyebrows rose slightly. "Your Malayalam is improving."

Heat climbed my neck. I lowered my eyes and bowed, letting the motion answer for me.

Dharma Raja's gaze moved to my hands. The powder stains, the calluses. A scholar's eyes noticing the marks of labour.

"De Lannoy tells me you have a head for numbers," he said.

I could feel De Lannoy's attention on me. Not pressure. Expectation.

"I can count," I said.

The minister looked faintly amused, as if the foreign gunner had spoken too simply in front of a king.

Dharma Raja did not smile, but his eyes warmed by a fraction.

"Then count for me," he said. "Count what it costs to keep a wall standing."

The minister opened his mouth, ready to offer an answer wrapped in polished words.

Dharma Raja raised one hand. The minister stopped.

The king's attention stayed on me.

I swallowed. My mouth tasted of sandalwood and fear.

"Rice," I said slowly. "Powder. Men who are paid on time. Carriages that do not rot. A magazine that stays dry. A fort that does not pretend the monsoon is only rain."

The minister's amusement vanished.

Dharma Raja nodded. "Good. You understand that walls are not stone. They are work."

He turned back to the minister.

"Send twice the usual money for powder and saltpetre to Udayagiri," he said. "I want the magazine full before the next rains."

"Your Highness," the minister began, "the temple renovations-"

Dharma Raja's voice stayed quiet. "The gods will not hold the wall when Mysore comes."

The room went still.

No one had said that name aloud yet. Mysore. It sat in the air like smoke.

Then the king looked away as if he had spoken about weather, not war.

"We will repair the temples," he continued, calm. "We will also repair the guns. Both are duties."

De Lannoy's mouth tightened. It might have been approval.

As we left the chamber, I realised my hands were trembling slightly.

Not from fear of punishment.

From the shock of being asked a question that mattered.

---

Outside, in the courtyard, the air felt different.

The palace was full of priests and scribes and men who smelled of perfumed oil rather than sweat. The fort was full of men who smelled of powder and damp cloth. I moved between those worlds now, neither fully belonging to either.

De Lannoy walked beside me in silence for a while. His boots made a steady sound on the stone.

When we reached the gate, he spoke.

"He listens," he said.

"Yes," I replied.

"That is his strength," De Lannoy continued. "It is also his danger. A man who listens can be talked into softness."

I thought of the minister's protest, the way he had tried to redirect money to temples, not powder.

"Will he be soft?" I asked.

De Lannoy's eyes lifted toward the northern hills. "The world will decide that for him."

He glanced at me. "And for you."

I did not like how true it sounded.

---

That night, Lakshmi listened to my account without interrupting.

We sat on the floor in our small house near the fort. A lamp burned in the corner, throwing the room into warm light. Rain ticked on the roof. Outside, frogs sang with the confidence of creatures that had never seen a cannon.

Lakshmi was mending cloth, her needle moving quick and sure. Our children slept behind a hanging cloth, their breathing soft. I could hear Willem's occasional sigh, as if even in sleep he was arguing with the world.

"He is a good man," Lakshmi said when I finished.

"Good does not stop cannonballs," I replied.

Lakshmi did not look up. "No. But good men make fewer enemies."

Marthanda Varma had made enemies as if collecting them was part of his strength. De Lannoy's stories of the prince hunted by his own family came back to me, the man who had survived by becoming a blade.

"He will still have enemies," I said.

Lakshmi tied off the thread and snapped it with her teeth. "Everyone has enemies. The question is whether you make them by accident or by choice."

Her words were simple, but they landed in me like a lesson.

In the Company, we were taught that enemies are expected. In Travancore, I was learning that enemies can also be manufactured, cultivated, fed.

Lakshmi set the cloth down and finally looked at me.

"Are you afraid?" she asked.

I could have lied. I had lied well for years. But Lakshmi had not married me for my lies.

"Yes," I said.

Lakshmi nodded, satisfied.

"Good," she replied. "Fear keeps you awake."

The phrase was so close to De Lannoy's that I almost laughed.

Lakshmi's mouth tightened. "Do not laugh. I have seen men die because they thought fear was shameful. Fear is a tool. Like your powder."

I looked down at my hands, at the stains that never fully washed out.

"The king asked me a question," I said quietly.

Lakshmi's eyes sharpened. "And that surprised you."

"Yes."

"It should," she said. "Marthanda Varma did not ask. He commanded. A man who asks is either weak or wise."

I stared at her. Lakshmi had never seen Marthanda Varma up close. She had only heard stories. Yet she spoke as if she had been in the palace with me.

That was her gift.

She understood people without needing to be told.

"Which is he?" I asked.

Lakshmi shrugged. "Both. Like all men."

She stood, stretched her shoulders, and walked to the hanging cloth that separated the sleeping children from the rest of the house. She pulled it aside and checked their faces, as if touching the future with her eyes.

"If the king is wise," she said without turning, "he will keep you close. He will keep De Lannoy close. He will keep men who know guns close."

"And if he is weak?"

Lakshmi lowered the cloth again and returned to sit beside me.

"Then we will still wake tomorrow," she said. "We will still feed the children. You will still go to the wall. The world does not stop because kings are afraid."

Her calm was not comfort. It was discipline.

I realised then that Lakshmi and De Lannoy had something in common.

They both understood that a kingdom is held by the work no one sings about.

---

Weeks later, I stood on the Udayagiri ramparts and watched the sea.

The cannon were clean. The powder was dry. The gunners drilled until their arms shook. The wall held its shape against rain and heat because men repaired it constantly, like stitching a wound that refuses to heal.

Below, traders moved along the road carrying pepper and cloth. Children ran between coconut palms. A priest walked toward the fort's small temple with a brass lamp in his hand.

It all looked peaceful, and peace is always a lie told between wars.

To the north, beyond the hills, there were other kingdoms. Other ambitions. Other men who were learning the same arithmetic of force that De Lannoy had taught me.

Hyder Ali was still only a rumour then, a name spoken in whispers, like a disease that has not yet reached your village.

But on that wall, with the sea wind in my face and the smell of powder in my memory, I understood something that the court's hopeful men did not.

An era had ended when Marthanda Varma's pyre was lit.

The new king sat on the throne and spoke of dharma.

And somewhere beyond the hills, the next war was already being built, one disciplined battalion at a time.

The cannons did not care what the king believed.

They waited, silent, for the moment they would be asked to speak again.

# Chapter 7: House by the Backwaters

In the mornings, before the fort began to shout, the backwaters were quiet enough to hear fish breathe.

Lakshmi would wake first, as she always did. She moved through the house with the soft confidence of someone who knows exactly where each object belongs. She lit the lamp, boiled rice water, checked the children's faces for fever, and stepped outside to look at the sky as if the clouds could be interrogated into honesty.

I woke later, to the smell of ginger and smoke and damp earth. For a moment, half asleep, I would forget where I was. Not Batavia. Not Ceylon. Not the sand of Colachel. This green place that had swallowed me and taught me to count in its language.

Then I would hear the fort's morning gun, a single shot fired not in anger but in discipline, and memory would return like a blade sliding into its sheath.

I would wash, strap on my sword, and become Captain Pieter again, the foreign gunner who understood the king's walls.

But in the morning, in our small house by the water, I was only a husband and a father, and those roles frightened me more than cannon ever had.

---

Willem asked his question on a day when the air smelled of pepper.

Merchants had laid out black peppercorns to dry on mats near the road, and the wind carried their sharp scent into everything. It clung to cloth and hair. It sat at the back of the throat like a warning.

Willem was eleven now. Old enough to begin serious training. Old enough to notice the way men looked at our household, the way their eyes slid from my face to Lakshmi's and then away as if avoiding an infection.

He sat on the threshold with a wooden stick in his hands, carving at it with his knife the way I carved at problems when I did not yet know how to think them through.

Lakshmi was inside, grinding spices. The stone made a steady sound, a rhythm that had nothing to do with war.

Willem did not look up when he spoke.

"Am I Dutch?" he asked.

The question was simple. It was also impossible.

I stood in the courtyard with my boots half on, one foot bare on the packed earth, the other trapped in leather. I had been about to leave for drill. The fort would not wait for a man's private crisis.

Still, I did not move.

"Why do you ask that?" I said.

Willem scraped his knife along the stick again. "The boys at the fort call me *Parangi kutty*," he said. "Foreign boy. When they are angry they call me worse things. When they are feeling kind, they ask me to say Dutch words so they can laugh at my mouth."

I felt heat rise under my collar.

"Who?" I demanded.

Willem shrugged, trying to look indifferent. It did not work. Pride and hurt showed through his face the way a bruise shows under skin.

"Everyone," he said.

Lakshmi's grinding stopped.

She appeared in the doorway, wiping her hands on her sari, her eyes sharp.

"Names do not matter," she said at once, too quickly. A lie spoken out of fear for her child.

Willem looked at her, then back at me. "They matter to them," he said. "They matter to me."

I crouched beside him, ignoring the way my knees complained. I was still young enough to move quickly, but not young enough to do it without consequence.

"You are Willem," I said. "You are my son. You are your mother's son. You belong to her people by blood and to me by choice."

Willem frowned. "That is not an answer."

He was right. It was a sentence designed to sound wise while avoiding the edge.

Lakshmi came closer. She sat on the threshold beside Willem and touched his hair, smoothing it back.

"You are Travancorean," she said. "This is your land. Your tongue is Malayalam. Your bones will be buried here."

Willem turned his head slightly, as if resisting comfort.

"Then why do they call me foreign?" he asked.

Lakshmi looked at me. Her eyes held accusation, not against me, but against the world.

I understood then that this was the price we had agreed to pay without naming it.

No conversion. No clean story. No priest's blessing that could make people forget what they saw.

We had chosen the in-between, and our children would live there too.

"Because your face reminds them that the world is larger than they want to admit," I said quietly. "Because some men need to make others small so they can feel safe."

Willem stared at me, processing. Then he asked the question that cut closer.

"Do you want me to be Dutch?" he said.

The pepper wind blew through the courtyard. Somewhere in the distance, a conch shell sounded near a temple.

I thought of Batavia, of my father speaking of Amsterdam as if it was paradise, of my mother humming songs that were not Dutch, of the Company ships that smelled of tar and sweat and ambition.

I thought of the prison straw under my cheek after Colachel.

I thought of De Lannoy's voice: war is arithmetic.

And I thought of Lakshmi's hand on my chest the night we married, touching the cross under my shirt without flinching.

"I do not want you to belong to a place you have never seen," I said. "I want you to belong to yourself."

Willem frowned, unsatisfied, but the sharpness in his shoulders eased slightly. Children accept imperfect answers because they must.

Lakshmi stood and picked up the grinding stone again with unnecessary force, as if crushing spice could crush the world's cruelty.

"Eat," she told Willem. "Then go to your training. If boys call you foreign, make them regret wasting breath."

Willem's mouth tightened into something like a smile. He rose and went inside.

I remained crouched for a moment, listening to the spice stone grind, listening to my own blood.

The fort's drumbeat began in the distance.

The day would not pause for a father's uncertainty.

---

I went to the fort as usual, but Willem's question sat in my mind like an unspent charge.

Gunnery drills require attention. A moment of distraction can kill a crew. I forced my mind onto numbers, onto angles, onto the clean logic of iron.

Still, as the men loaded and fired, I kept seeing my son's face.

Am I Dutch?

At midday, De Lannoy sent for me.

It was not unusual. He always had something to correct, some habit to break, some calculation to refine. I expected a lecture about powder storage or crew discipline.

Instead, he offered me a cup of coffee.

Coffee was still new in these lands then, a bitter drink that merchants prized and priests condemned as an indulgence. De Lannoy drank it without apology. He had never cared much about priests.

"Sit," he said.

I sat.

De Lannoy watched me over the rim of his cup. "You look like a man who has misfired and is waiting for the barrel to burst," he said.

I hesitated, then realised there was no point in hiding. De Lannoy knew the fort's gossip before it formed.

"My son asked me if he is Dutch," I said.

De Lannoy's eyes softened slightly. Not sympathy. Recognition.

"And what did you tell him?"

"That he is himself," I replied.

De Lannoy snorted. "That is the answer of a man who wants to sound wise and feels foolish."

I felt irritation flare. Then I realised he was right.

De Lannoy set his cup down.

"Bring your son here one day," he said. "Let him see my wife. Let him see my house."

I blinked, surprised.

De Lannoy rarely spoke of his home life. It existed, but he kept it separate from the fort the way he kept his chapel separate from the king's rituals.

"Why?" I asked.

De Lannoy looked toward the small chapel door. "Because he should understand that belonging is not granted by priests," he said. "It is carved out, like a gun embrasure, against resistance."

He stood. "Come," he said. "Now."

---

De Lannoy's house sat near the fort, close enough that he could reach the walls quickly, far enough that the sound of drill did not enter every room.

It was larger than mine, because De Lannoy had power in a way I did not. It was also strangely plain, as if he did not trust comfort.

Margaret met us at the doorway.

She was not young any longer. The sun of this coast had darkened her skin, and the years had carved faint lines at the corners of her eyes. She wore a sari, not European dress, but around her neck a small cross rested against her collarbone.

She looked at me once, then at De Lannoy.

"You have brought your shadow home," she said in Portuguese.

De Lannoy replied in the same language, his mouth still shaped by Europe even after years of Malayalam. "He is not my shadow. He is his own problem."

Margaret's eyes flicked to mine. "You hear that?" she asked, amused. "Even in his own house he pretends he is alone."

De Lannoy ignored the comment and walked inside.

Margaret gestured for me to follow.

The house smelled of beeswax and old wood and something sweet simmering on a fire. In one corner, a small altar held a cross and a candle. In another, a lamp burned before a small image of a local deity, because Margaret had grown up among different faiths and had learned not to insult the land that fed her.

It was the first place I had seen that held both without pretending they were the same.

Margaret noticed my gaze.

"You look relieved," she said.

"I did not expect this," I admitted.

Margaret's mouth tightened into a smile that held no softness.

"My father did not expect it either," she said.

She poured toddy into small cups and handed one to me. The drink was sharp, sweet, and a little sour, like every compromise in this kingdom.

"He refused De Lannoy at first," Margaret said, as casually as if discussing weather. "A defector. A Frenchman. Disgraced. A man who turned his coat and served a Hindu king. My father said my blood would be polluted by shame."

De Lannoy's voice came from the back room, dry. "He said worse than that."

Margaret laughed. "Yes. He did. In three languages."

She sat on a low bench and looked at me with sudden seriousness.

"When the king heard," she continued, "he was ready to march on Anchuthengu and burn the English factory down around my father's account books. That is what Marthanda Varma was like. He did not separate private insult from public authority. If someone refused what he wanted, he made refusal dangerous."

I remembered De Lannoy's words on the day of the king's death. He would have marched for a marriage.

Margaret's eyes hardened as she spoke.

"The ministers talked him down," she said. "They told him it would anger the Europeans, complicate trade, invite trouble. They told him he could not afford another war for a woman's marriage."

She lifted her cup. "As if wars are ever fought for honest reasons."

I drank without knowing how to respond.

Margaret leaned forward slightly.

"My father relented," she said. "Not because he loved me enough to want me happy. Because he feared the king. Because he understood that the king's anger could reach even a European factory."

She paused. Then her voice softened, a rare thing.

"And then I married this stubborn man," she said, nodding toward De Lannoy. "And we were happy. Happier than any of them expected. Happier than my father deserved."

From the back room, De Lannoy called, "Do not make me sound like a saint."

Margaret replied, "I would never insult you that way."

The exchange was intimate in a way that made my chest tighten. Not romance. Not softness. A shared language of survival.

Margaret looked at me again.

"You have children," she said.

"Yes."

"Do they belong?" she asked, blunt.

I thought of Willem's question.

"I do not know," I admitted.

Margaret nodded, satisfied. "Good. That is the beginning of truth. Everyone else will pretend they know, and their pretending will make your children bleed."

She stood and walked to the altar, adjusting the candle with a practised hand.

"Tell your son this," she said without turning. "Belonging is not a gift. It is not a priest's blessing. It is not a name. It is the work you do every day until the land has no choice but to admit you are part of it."

Her words sounded like De Lannoy's, and I realised that Margaret had learned the same arithmetic in a different arena.

De Lannoy returned to the room then, a cloth-wrapped object in his hands.

He set it on the table and unwrapped it.

A small wooden horse, carved roughly, the kind a child might play with.

"For Willem," he said.

Margaret's eyes flicked toward him, amused. "For Willem," she echoed. "Not because you care about children."

De Lannoy glared. "Because the boy will be a soldier one day. Soldiers should have something made of wood before they have something made of iron."

He pushed the horse toward me.

"Take it," he said. "And tell your son that I was foreign too, once, in the way that matters. I lost it. I did not die. He will not die either."

I picked up the horse. The wood was smooth where hands had worn it.

"Thank you," I said.

De Lannoy waved the words away as if gratitude was wasteful.

On the way out, Margaret touched my sleeve lightly.

"Your wife," she said. "Lakshmi. She is strong."

"Yes," I replied.

Margaret's gaze sharpened. "Then listen to her when she tells you the truth. Do not make your children carry your uncertainty like a sack of stones."

I nodded, feeling both chastised and helped.

Outside, the fort's drums began again.

I walked back to my house by the backwaters with a wooden horse under my arm and the taste of toddy and pepper in my mouth, and I understood something I had not understood before.

My life here was not temporary. It was not an exile waiting to end.

It was a construction, like a wall, built by stubborn hands in monsoon rain.

That night, I placed the wooden horse beside Willem's sleeping mat.

In the morning, he would find it and ask questions.

And I would try, again, to answer without lying.

# Chapter 8: The Sons of De Lannoy

The first time I saw Hendrik and Caspar together on the guns, I understood why men fear inheritance.

A father can build a wall and still leave cracks in the stones.

De Lannoy's sons were those cracks, and they were also the proof that the wall had been built at all.

---

De Lannoy called for a full drill at Udayagiri on a day when the sky was clear enough to tempt pride.

The monsoon had loosened its grip for a week. The air was still heavy, but the sun had teeth again. Heat rose off the stone walls and turned the gun yard into an oven. Powder dried quickly in that heat, which made gunners careless, because men always relax when conditions feel favourable.

De Lannoy did not relax.

He stood at the edge of the yard with a small sandglass in his hand, the kind merchants used to time bargains. He had stolen the object from trade and turned it into a weapon.

"We are too slow," he said in Malayalam, loud enough that every crew could hear. "In war you do not get extra time because you are sweating."

The crews muttered under their breath. Sweat ran down faces and darkened cloth. The guns sat in a row, cleaned and ready, their muzzles pointed toward the range where palm trunks and sand berms waited to be punched apart.

I stood beside De Lannoy, notebook in hand, pretending to be calm. I was not. When De Lannoy decided a drill was not good enough, men got hurt trying to satisfy him.

Then Margaret arrived with his sons.

She did not stand in the yard. Margaret was too practical to place herself near iron. She remained under the shade of the eaves, arms folded, eyes on her husband as if watching him was its own kind of duty.

Hendrik stepped into the yard first.

He was in his early twenties, tall and lean, with his father's straight-backed posture and his mother's dark eyes. His hair was tied neatly. His uniform was clean. He carried himself as if every movement had been rehearsed.

Caspar followed.

Caspar was younger by five years, and it showed in his mouth more than his body. He smiled too easily. He moved like a man who knew the rules and enjoyed walking close enough to their edge to make others nervous.

His uniform was also clean, but it looked as if he had dressed quickly, the belt not quite straight, the collar not quite aligned. A small thing, but De Lannoy noticed small things the way gunners notice a change in wind.

The boys on the crews stared. A commander's sons were always watched. Watched for favour, watched for weakness, watched for the chance to gossip.

De Lannoy did not acknowledge the attention.

"Hendrik," he said.

Hendrik stepped forward. "Yes, Father."

De Lannoy's eyes moved to Caspar. "Caspar."

"Yes, Father," Caspar replied, and there was humour in it, as if the word father amused him.

De Lannoy raised the sandglass. "Demonstrate."

Hendrik's face did not change. Caspar's smile widened.

They walked to a gun in the centre of the line, a field piece with a crew of six men waiting beside it.

Hendrik looked at the crew once. His gaze went to their hands, their tools, their stance. He adjusted the position of one man by touching his elbow and moving it a finger width inward.

The man obeyed, startled by the precision.

Caspar said nothing. He only picked up the rammer and spun it in his hands with casual confidence, as if the heavy wooden staff was a stick for a boy's game.

De Lannoy turned the sandglass and the grains began to fall.

"Load," Hendrik said.

The crew moved.

Sponge, the wet sheepskin head pushed down the barrel to extinguish embers. Powder charge, measured and poured. Wad, tamped. Shot, heavy in the hand. Wad again. The rammer thudded, once, twice, until the shot sat properly against the charge.

Hendrik watched the sequence with the cold attention of a man counting heartbeats.

Caspar watched too, but his attention was different. He looked less at the hands and more at the gun itself, the angle of the carriage, the slight tilt of the wheel in the dirt. He crouched and shoved a stone under the wheel to level it, a move no one had ordered.

Hendrik did not comment. He did not need to. His crew was already adjusting as if Caspar's instinct was part of the plan.

"Prime," Hendrik ordered.

A man opened the vent, pricked it, poured fine powder into the pan, closed the frizzen. Match held ready, eyes on Hendrik.

Hendrik lifted the quadrant, measured elevation, made a minute adjustment with the wedge.

Caspar leaned toward the muzzle and peered down the line of the barrel, as if he could see the target through heat shimmer.

Hendrik raised his hand.

The yard went quiet in that strange way it always did just before firing, as if men forget to breathe when iron is about to speak.

Hendrik dropped his hand.

The gun fired.

The blast hit my chest and made my ribs vibrate. Smoke rolled out and drifted on the faint wind from the sea. Somewhere downrange, a palm trunk jumped as the shot struck it.

Hendrik was already turning to the sandglass.

"Thirty-two seconds," he said, calm.

Some of the crew smiled, proud. Others looked afraid, because pride makes a man careless and De Lannoy punished carelessness.

Caspar spun the rammer again, grinning.

"We can do it in under thirty," he said.

Hendrik's eyes flicked to him. "Under thirty is meaningless if the shot goes wide."

Caspar shrugged. "Wide is meaningless if the enemy is close."

Hendrik's mouth tightened. "You speak as if war is a brawl."

Caspar's grin turned sharper. "Sometimes it is."

The crew, still holding tools, looked between them the way men watch a knife fight begin.

De Lannoy stepped forward.

He did not shout. He did not strike.

"Again," he said.

The word landed like a hammer.

The crew reset. Sponge, powder, wad, shot. The rhythm returned.

On the second loading, something went wrong.

It was small at first, so small that only trained eyes would catch it. The sponge came out of the barrel with a faint thread of smoke clinging to it, like a ghost.

An ember remained inside the gun.

If the next powder charge went in, the ember could ignite it before the wad was seated. A premature discharge could rip through the crew. It could turn the gun yard into meat and splinters.

The crew did not notice. They were already reaching for the powder.

Caspar noticed.

He moved without thinking, and his movement was faster than discipline.

He grabbed the powder charge out of the boy's hands and threw it into a bucket of water with a hiss. Then he seized the sponge staff and rammed it down the barrel again, hard, twisting, forcing the wet sheepskin to smother whatever heat remained.

"Idiots," he snapped in Malayalam. "You want to die to impress my father?"

The crew froze, shocked.

Hendrik stared at him. For a moment, the older brother's precision looked like paralysis.

De Lannoy's face did not change, but his eyes sharpened.

"Good," he said quietly.

He turned to the crew. "Do you see?"

The men nodded, chastened.

De Lannoy looked at Hendrik. "Discipline," he said.

Then he looked at Caspar. "Instinct."

He lifted the sandglass again. "You need both. A gun does not care which saved you. It only cares that you live long enough to load again."

The drill continued.

Hendrik regained his rhythm. His voice stayed calm. His hand signals were clean. Under his command, the crew moved like a single body.

Caspar stopped grinning.

When he worked, he worked with ferocity, as if the near disaster had reminded him that war is never a game for long.

At the end of the drill, the sandglass ran empty. The last grains settled.

De Lannoy nodded. "Better."

The word was praise from him, and it landed on the yard like rain after heat. Men exhaled. Tools were set down. Hands wiped sweat from eyes.

Hendrik turned to Caspar and said, quietly, "You should not have shouted."

Caspar's laugh was sharp. "And you should not have frozen."

Hendrik's jaw tightened. "I did not freeze. I assessed."

Caspar's eyes glittered. "Assessment is a fine thing. It does not stop fire."

For a moment I thought Hendrik would strike him.

Instead, Hendrik looked past him to their father.

De Lannoy was already walking away, as if the argument did not exist.

Hendrik's face softened by a fraction, something like defeat.

Caspar watched his brother's expression and his own mouth twisted, not quite a smile, not quite regret.

They followed their father in silence.

---

That evening, Margaret served dinner as if nothing had happened.

Her house was full of small acts of denial. A clean table. A lamp burning steadily. Rice and fish and coconut in bowls that were not chipped. A family eating together as if war was only a word spoken by men who wanted money.

Hendrik ate quietly, his posture perfect. Caspar ate too fast, as if he was still running from something.

Margaret watched them both with a mother's eyes, seeing cracks no one else wanted to see.

De Lannoy spoke of powder stores and carriage repairs. He spoke of the new king's orders. He spoke as if he could keep his sons safe by keeping the conversation technical.

It did not work. Nothing keeps men safe.

After the meal, Hendrik left to review range tables and crew assignments. That was his comfort, paper and order.

Caspar went outside and drank from a small flask he did not think his mother had noticed.

Margaret noticed everything.

She came to me when the men had scattered and the house had quieted.

"He is brave," she said, meaning Caspar.

"Yes," I replied.

Margaret's eyes narrowed. "Do not say it like an officer," she said. "Say it like a man who knows what bravery costs."

I felt my throat tighten, annoyed by my own helplessness.

"Caspar will die," I said, and hated myself for how calm it sounded.

Margaret did not flinch. She had been a factor's daughter. She had lived among men who traded lives the way they traded pepper.

"Perhaps," she said. "Or perhaps he will live and become bitter, which is sometimes worse."

She looked toward the doorway where Caspar stood in the yard, head tilted back, drinking as if he could swallow his own restlessness.

"He cannot live in peace," she said. "Hendrik lives for peace, for order. Caspar lives for the moment the gun speaks and the world narrows to one decision."

I thought of Colachel. Of the smoke. Of the moment the world narrowed to a line and a curve.

I understood Caspar more than I wanted to.

"And Hendrik?" I asked.

Margaret's mouth tightened. "Hendrik will inherit the guns," she said. "He will inherit his father's enemies, his father's obligations, his father's legend. He will spend his life trying to be worthy of a man who cannot be replaced."

She looked at me, suddenly sharp.

"And you," she said. "You will be between them."

I felt that sentence settle in my bones like an order.

Between them.

Between worlds.

Between faiths.

Between the Dutch boy who had died at Colachel and the Travancorean officer who stood on the wall and counted powder.

Margaret touched my sleeve, brief and light.

"Do not let them tear each other apart," she said. "If they do, their father will die before his body does."

That night, as I walked back to my house by the backwaters, I heard the fort's guns on the range, a steady thunder in the distance.

In the dark, Caspar's shout in the gun yard echoed in my head.

Idiots. You want to die to impress my father?

I thought of Willem asleep on his mat, the wooden horse De Lannoy had carved beside him.

I thought of the sons who would inherit the guns, whether they wanted to or not.

Inheritance is a weapon.

It can keep a kingdom standing.

It can also cut the hand that holds it.


# Chapter 9: News from Mysore

News has a smell.

In Batavia it smelled of salt and clove, carried on the backs of sailors who had not washed in weeks. In Ceylon it smelled of cinnamon and wet rope. In Travancore it came on the pepper boats, wrapped in the sharp sweetness of spice and the sour stink of fish, and it came on the tongues of men who had walked too far and slept too little.

The first time I heard Hyder Ali's name spoken in Udayagiri, it did not sound like a king's name. It sounded like a soldier's name, short and hard, the kind of name you shout over cannon fire when you want a man to move.

De Lannoy did not look up from his slate when the messenger said it.

I did.

---

It was a day of drills, the kind that left men hungry and irritable and convinced they had been made to suffer for no reason.

Hendrik ran the battery like a clock. Sponge. Load. Ram. Prick. Prime. Aim. Fire. Each command snapped out, each movement answered by hands that had learned to obey without thinking. The gun crews sweated through their cloth and kept their eyes on Hendrik's fingers, waiting for the next signal.

Caspar stood behind the second gun with his arms folded, watching as if he were bored. Boredom was his disguise. When he was bored he was dangerous, because he was looking for something that could make him feel alive.

I moved along the line, checking vents, checking wedges, listening for the small sounds that meant a carriage bolt had loosened. A gun tells you what it needs if you have the patience to hear it.

The messenger arrived in the middle of a firing sequence, which was either brave or foolish. He pushed through the gun yard with his head bowed against the smoke, coughing as if the powder had insulted him.

He was not one of our men. His cloth was travel-stained, his feet cracked. A strip of white bandage wrapped his forehead, and dried blood had turned the cloth brown at the edge.

He had come fast.

Hendrik saw him first. His hand went up and the yard froze. The gun crews held their positions, sponges still in barrels, rammers still against shot, as if time itself had been ordered to stop.

The messenger walked straight to De Lannoy.

De Lannoy stepped out from the shade of the shed, crop in one hand, slate in the other. He looked the man up and down, assessing injuries the way he assessed guns.

"Who sent you?" he asked in Malayalam.

"The *Dalawa*," the messenger replied, voice hoarse. "From Padmanabhapuram. Raja Kesavadas."

At that name, De Lannoy's attention sharpened.

He glanced at me. "Pieter. Come."

I followed him into the shed. Hendrik came too, expression tight. Caspar drifted after us like smoke, pretending he had only followed out of curiosity.

The gun yard resumed behind us, the next volley cracking, then rolling into echoes against the fort walls.

---

The shed smelled of chalk and old powder, of leather straps and oiled wood. It was where De Lannoy kept his maps and his tables, his measurements and his quiet plans. It was the closest thing he had to a private world.

The messenger sank onto a low stool without being invited. Travel had hollowed him out. His hands shook as he reached for the water De Lannoy pushed toward him.

He drank and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

"Speak," De Lannoy said.

The messenger drew a breath that sounded like it hurt.

"Mysore is changing," he said. "They say the Raja is still there, still on the throne, but the throne is only a chair now. The man who sits beside it gives the orders."

De Lannoy's eyes narrowed. "Name."

"Hyder Ali," the messenger said.

Caspar made a small sound of impatience. "We have heard names from Mysore before," he said in Malayalam, casual but dismissive. "Kings, ministers, generals. They fight each other. They drink. They die."

The messenger looked at him, then back at De Lannoy. "This one does not drink," he said. "Or if he does, he does it in private."

Hendrik's mouth twitched, as if he was about to laugh and decided it was not safe.

The messenger continued.

"He was a soldier," he said. "They say he rose from nothing. A man of the saddle, not the court. He fought for the Raja and won, and now the Raja cannot say no to him."

De Lannoy pulled a map toward him, the parchment worn at the folds. It was not a Dutch map. Dutch maps were proud things, full of lines and names and the illusion that drawing a coast meant owning it. This map had been copied by local scribes and corrected by De Lannoy's own hand, practical and ugly, a map meant to keep men alive.

He placed a finger on the rough shape of Mysore.

"What has he done?" De Lannoy asked.

The messenger swallowed. "He drills his men," he said. "Every day. He pays them on time. He punishes thieves. He builds magazines and keeps them dry. He has taken forts that held out against others for years."

That last detail mattered more than the name. Forts do not surrender to speeches. They surrender to hunger, or fear, or gunpowder applied with patience.

De Lannoy's finger moved down the map, tracing the routes south.

"How far?" he asked.

"Not to us yet," the messenger said. "But he has moved west and north. He has swallowed little kingdoms the way fire swallows dry grass. The smoke is rising. The other powers are watching and pretending they do not smell it."

De Lannoy leaned back slightly.

Hendrik spoke, cautious. "And the Company?"

The messenger shrugged. "The Company smiles," he said. "They have always smiled. They send letters. They make alliances with men who will betray them and then act surprised when it happens."

Caspar snorted.

De Lannoy did not.

"You saw this yourself?" he asked the messenger.

The messenger nodded, then hesitated, as if deciding whether to speak the next part.

De Lannoy waited. He was good at waiting. He had built a kingdom's army out of patience.

"I was with a caravan north of Palakkad," the messenger said finally. "Pepper and cardamom going up, iron coming down. We were not soldiers. We were men with knives and prayers, and we believed the road would let us pass if we kept our heads down."

His fingers tightened around the cup.

"We were wrong," he said. "Hyder's men took the road as if it belonged to them. They stopped every caravan, searched every bale. They were not bandits. Bandits take what they can carry. These men took what they wanted and wrote down what they left behind."

He looked at De Lannoy, eyes fever-bright.

"They were organised," he said. "They had officers who could count."

De Lannoy's gaze flicked to me for a moment, as if he could not help comparing.

The messenger went on.

"A poligar's men tried to stop them at a narrow stretch of road," he said. "He had a wall and a ditch and a hundred men with matchlocks who had never been paid properly. He thought the road would make him strong."

His voice roughened as he remembered.

"Hyder's infantry came in ranks," he said. "Not charging, not shouting, just walking forward as if they had all agreed to die on the same step. The poligar's men fired. Smoke covered them. Men fell. The next rank stepped over the bodies and kept walking."

I pictured it without wanting to. A line of muskets. The rhythm of feet. The way disciplined men move through fear by turning it into habit.

"The poligar's cavalry charged," the messenger said. "They thought horses could solve what walls could not."

Caspar's eyes sharpened. He liked cavalry. He liked the simplicity of speed and steel.

"Hyder's men did not break," the messenger said. "They opened. They let the horses come into the gap. Then they closed again behind them, and the cavalry found itself in a pocket of smoke and bayonets."

Hendrik inhaled softly. Bayonets. A European word, a European method. Local armies had always had spears. Bayonets were spears welded to guns, a promise that a man could kill at distance and then kill again up close.

"And then," the messenger said, and his hands began to shake again, "the rockets came."

The word landed in the shed with a small thud, as if someone had dropped an iron weight.

"Describe them," De Lannoy said.

The messenger swallowed twice. "Iron tubes," he said. "As long as a man's forearm. Lashed to bamboo. Men carried them like bundles of firewood until an officer shouted, then they knelt and touched flame to the fuse."

His eyes darted as if he could still see it.

"They screamed," he said. "Not like a gun. Like an animal. They flew low, bouncing when they hit the ground, skidding and spinning. One went into the ditch and burst there, and the ditch became a pot of boiling blood. Another hit a horse in the belly and the horse opened, like a sack cut with a knife."

Caspar's jaw tightened. Hendrik's face stayed still, but his knuckles went white where his hand rested on the map.

I felt my stomach turn, not from squeamishness but from recognition.

The messenger was describing a weapon that did not behave like cannon or musket. Cannon balls are predictable. Muskets are inaccurate but simple. Rockets, if they were truly being used like this, were something else. Chaos harnessed. A weapon that made fear part of its mechanism.

"The poligar's men ran," the messenger said. "Not because they were cowards. Because the sound made their legs move. Men ran and looked back and ran again. The cavalry tried to wheel away, but the horses could not see through the smoke. They trampled their own men in the ditch."

His voice dropped.

"The road was full of blood and broken carts," he said. "Hyder's men walked through it and did not hurry."

Silence filled the shed.

Outside, the gun yard's thunder sounded suddenly childish, like boys playing at war.

De Lannoy looked down at the map as if it had become a different object.

When he spoke, his voice was quiet.

"This one is different," he said.

He did not say it with fear. He said it with the calm of a man recognising a new kind of weather.

He looked at Hendrik, then at Caspar, then at me.

"We have fought kings," he said. "We have fought merchants. We have fought the vanity of Europe."

His crop tapped the map once, near Mysore.

"Now we may have to fight a soldier," he said. "A man who will learn from every mistake we make."

---

That evening, when I returned to my house by the backwaters, Lakshmi was cutting fish on a flat stone in the yard. The smell of salt and blood rose in the humid air. Our children played with a wooden wheel near the steps, arguing in a mixture of Malayalam and the Dutch I had taught them in moments of foolish sentiment.

Lakshmi looked up when she saw my face.

"Bad news," she said.

She had already read it on my face.

I sat on the step and watched the backwater shift under the last light, the surface broken by small ripples from unseen fish.

"Mysore," I said.

Lakshmi's knife kept moving, steady. "Mysore is far," she said.

For a moment I wanted to believe her. Distance is comforting. It lets men pretend war belongs to other people's lives.

I pictured the messenger's rockets, the way he had described them skidding and screaming, the way a ditch could become a pot of boiling blood.

"Far is not the same as safe," I said.

Lakshmi set the fish aside and rinsed her hands. She sat beside me, close enough that our shoulders touched.

"De Lannoy is worried," she said.

I nodded.

Lakshmi watched the children, her expression unreadable. "Then it is true," she said quietly. "When the old lion worries, the jungle is changing."

She did not ask for details. She did not ask me to promise anything. She knew promises are for men who control the future.

She simply put her hand on mine, warm and solid, and kept it there until the light faded.

In the dark, across the water, a night bird called once, sharp and lonely.

I lay awake long after Lakshmi and the children slept.

I tried to turn the messenger's account into numbers. How many men. How many rockets. How much powder. How far they could travel in a day.

Numbers usually steadied me.

That night they did not.

# Chapter 10: The Rocket Wound

The first rocket wound I saw in Travancore arrived on a bullock cart.

It came under a torn canopy of palm leaves, with flies already circling. The cart wheels creaked in the fort gate, and the sound drew men the way blood draws dogs. Soldiers gathered, curious, then recoiled when the smell reached them.

Burned flesh has its own language. It does not smell like clean firewood or kitchen smoke. It smells like hair and fat and cloth melted into skin. It smells like something that should not exist.

The wounded man lay on his side, teeth clenched, eyes half-closed. His shirt had been cut away and the flesh of his shoulder and ribs was blistered and blackened in patches, as if someone had thrown boiling oil and then pressed hot iron into him for good measure.

This was not a musket wound.

This was not a cannon wound.

This was something else.

---

I pushed through the ring of men and climbed onto the cart.

The wounded man's breath rattled. When he inhaled, his ribs lifted unevenly. A smaller man might have screamed. This man made no sound. Pain had gone past noise and become a steady thing that lived in the body.

De Lannoy appeared beside me, as if he had been standing behind my shoulder all along.

He did not ask who the man was. He did not ask which god had been offended. He looked at the burns, the ragged tears in the skin beneath them, and he asked the only question that mattered.

"Where did this happen?" he said.

The escort captain, dusty and hollow-eyed, saluted. "North of Palakkad," he said. "On the road. We were bringing saltpetre from Coimbatore. We thought the passes were quiet."

Quiet, I thought, the way a tiger is quiet before it moves.

De Lannoy's gaze held on the man's shoulder.

Embedded in the burned flesh were small dark points, like seeds under skin. When I touched one gently with the tip of a knife, the man flinched so hard the cart shook.

Not seeds.

Fragments.

Shrapnel.

I had seen shrapnel once, long ago, in Ceylon, when a gun burst and the barrel turned into a swarm of knives. But this was different. These fragments were too uniform, too numerous. A gun bursting is an accident. This was design.

"Bring him inside," De Lannoy said.

Men lifted the wounded man carefully, as if afraid his body might fall apart, and carried him toward the infirmary room near the magazine.

As they moved, one of the men in the crowd crossed himself. Another muttered a Malayalam prayer. A third spat, as if spitting could drive bad luck away.

I followed the stretcher and tasted powder in my mouth though there had been no firing.

---

The infirmary was a small room with a low ceiling and a single shuttered window. It smelled of turmeric, old cloth, and sweat that had soaked into the floorboards. The fort's healer, a thin man with calm hands, was already boiling water in a brass pot.

De Lannoy spoke to him in Malayalam, quick and precise.

"We need the fragments," De Lannoy said, then switched to Dutch for my benefit. "If we can take them out, take them out."

The healer glanced at me, then at De Lannoy. He was used to strange orders from the foreign captain. He did not argue. He simply nodded and laid out his tools.

The wounded man opened his eyes.

His gaze found me and held on my face with dull recognition, as if he had seen me somewhere in a fever.

"Parangi," he whispered, the word shaped with contempt and need at the same time.

I felt the old sting in my chest and ignored it. Words were lighter than this man's pain.

"Hold him," the healer said.

Two soldiers took the man's arms. I put my hand on his uninjured shoulder, feeling the heat of his skin through my palm. His body trembled.

The healer washed the burns with cooled water. The wounded man's throat tightened and a thin sound escaped him, not a cry, more a cough forced out by pain.

Then the healer began to pull.

The first fragment came free with a wet sound.

It was not lead. It was iron, dark and jagged, no bigger than my fingernail. The healer dropped it into a small bowl with a sharp clink.

Another. Another. Another.

Each piece made the same sound when it hit the bowl, like coins that no one wanted.

The wounded man bit down on a cloth and shook. Sweat rolled down his temples. The cloth darkened with saliva and blood.

When the healer reached deeper, the man finally broke. He clawed at the soldiers holding him, a full-bodied animal panic, and one soldier nearly lost his grip.

I leaned in close and spoke in Malayalam, because it was the only language I had in this land that sounded like comfort.

"Breathe," I said. "Breathe and you will live."

The words felt foolish as soon as I said them.

The man stared at me, eyes wild, and then, with effort that looked like courage, he dragged in a breath.

---

When the healer had taken out as many fragments as he could reach, he stepped back, hands stained.

"There is more," he said, calm. "Too deep. If I chase it, I will kill him."

De Lannoy nodded, accepting the limits.

He turned to the bowl of fragments.

I picked up one with tweezers and held it to the light. The edges were sharp but not random. One side was slightly curved, as if it had been part of a tube.

I picked up another. Same curve.

I was looking at pieces of a casing.

Not a gun barrel.

A rocket.

The word came into my head with a cold certainty.

The messenger's story from yesterday stopped being a story and became metal in my hand.

I set the fragments down and looked at the wounds again, not as a healer would, not as a priest would, but as a gunner.

The burn patterns mattered. The clustering of shrapnel mattered. The way some fragments had entered at an angle and others straight on mattered.

The wounded man's body was an arithmetic problem written in flesh.

That thought should have revolted me more than it did.

Instead it steadied me.

That was when I understood something ugly about myself.

---

When the wounded man had been given a bitter potion to dull his pain, De Lannoy questioned the escort captain in the shed.

Hendrik came in, face tight. Caspar hovered near the doorway, pretending he had wandered in by accident.

De Lannoy unrolled the map again.

"Tell me exactly," De Lannoy said. "Where you were. How many. What you saw."

The captain swallowed. "We were on the road below the pass," he said, pointing with a dirty finger. "Two carts. Eight men. No soldiers, only guards. We heard nothing at first. Then the sound came."

He paused, as if embarrassed by how afraid he still felt.

"Like a demon," he said finally. "Like something screaming because it hates being alive."

Caspar's eyes flicked to mine, quick, and then away.

"And then?" De Lannoy said.

"Smoke," the captain said. "Fire. The first rocket hit the road in front of us and bounced. It bounced like a stone on water. It went under the lead cart and burst there. The cart lifted and fell on the oxen. The oxen screamed and broke their harness."

His hands moved as he spoke, involuntary, as if his body was still trying to dodge.

"Another rocket hit a tree and spun," he said. "It came at us sideways. It burst behind the second cart. That is when he was hit."

He nodded toward the infirmary.

"We fired our matchlocks," the captain said. "We fired into smoke. We did not hit anything. Then men came out of the smoke with bayonets. Bayonets, Parangi style. They did not run. They walked. They killed the two guards who tried to stand. The rest of us ran."

He looked at the floor.

"We abandoned the saltpetre," he said. "We abandoned the carts. We carried him, and we ran until our lungs felt like torn cloth."

De Lannoy's crop tapped the map once, not in anger, but in thought.

Hendrik spoke, controlled. "How many rockets?"

"Five," the captain said. "Maybe six. After the first two, I stopped counting. Counting did not help."

It was a soldier's confession.

De Lannoy looked at me. "What do you think?" he asked.

The shed felt suddenly smaller. I could feel all of them watching me, waiting for the foreign gunner to translate fear into something useful.

I picked up one of the fragments again.

"Iron casing," I said. "Not a gun burst. Deliberate. The shrapnel is too consistent."

Hendrik nodded slightly, his mind already moving toward counters, toward drills.

Caspar leaned forward, interested despite himself. "Can you make them?" he asked.

De Lannoy's eyes snapped to him. Not anger. Warning.

"You can make anything that burns," De Lannoy said. "The question is whether you can control it."

I turned the fragment between the tweezers.

"They do not need control," I said quietly. "Not perfect control. They need fear. A rocket that misses still screams. A rocket that skids still forces men to look away. It breaks formation."

The words sounded strange in Malayalam, but they were true in any language.

De Lannoy's gaze stayed on me.

"Write it down," he said.

It was an order. It was also permission.

---

That night I sat in the shed long after the gun yard had gone quiet.

I drew the wound in charcoal on a scrap of paper. I drew the clustering of fragments, the burns, the angles. I drew the curve of the iron casing as best I could, then wrote notes beside it in Dutch, because Dutch was the language I used when I wanted distance.

Approximate casing thickness.

Approximate powder charge.

Estimated range from scatter pattern.

None of it was certain. Rockets were unpredictable. That was the point. But the fragments told a story even when the flight path did not.

I should have felt only horror.

I felt horror.

I also felt a cold admiration, the way a man might admire a knife that is well made even as he watches it cut a throat.

That was the part of me I did not like to look at.

I heard footsteps outside and tensed, instinctive. Then Lakshmi's voice spoke my name, soft.

"Pieter," she called.

I stepped out of the shed.

Lakshmi stood in the moonlight with a shawl around her shoulders. Her hair was loose, dark against her skin. Behind her, the fort was a black shape against the sky.

"You did not come home," she said.

I wiped my hands on my cloth though there was no grease on them.

"There was work," I said.

Lakshmi's eyes moved to the paper in my hand. She did not ask to read it. She knew it was not meant for her. She knew I used writing the way some men used prayer.

"Work," she repeated, and the word carried a judgement.

She stepped closer and touched my cheek with her fingertips.

"You smell like burned flesh," she said.

The truth of it made my throat tighten.

I had washed my hands. I had rinsed my face. The smell was still in me, as if it had found a way into the pores.

Lakshmi's voice stayed steady.

"Do not bring that fire into the house," she said. "If it lives in you, it will try to live in our children."

I wanted to tell her that fire was already in the world, already moving south, and that a man could not keep it out by closing a door.

Instead I nodded.

Lakshmi took my hand and pulled me toward home.

Behind us, in the infirmary, a man groaned in his sleep, and the sound followed me like a rope tied around my ankle.


# Chapter 11: English Faces

The first time an Englishman called me brother, I wanted to hit him.

Not because he had insulted me. He had done the opposite. He had smiled, and put his hand on my arm as if we had shared a childhood, as if we had prayed in the same church, as if I had not watched English ships take Dutch ports while our officers wrote polite protests and pretended paper could stop cannon.

He had meant it as comfort.

That was what made it dangerous.

---

They arrived at Udayagiri in a palanquin and on horseback, under a white cloth canopy like men who feared the sun was a weapon aimed personally at them.

The Travancore escort rode hard, spears upright, cloth tied tight against sweat. The English rode stiffly, as if their bodies had been built for colder air. Their red coats were bright enough to be seen from the wall, a moving stain against the green.

I watched from the parapet as they approached the gate.

English officers look younger than they are. Their faces are pale, their cheeks soft with food, their eyes quick with calculation. They are trained to hide fear behind manners. They are trained to treat a smile as a kind of armour.

The fort guards looked them over with the wary contempt soldiers reserve for men who think cloth can replace steel.

De Lannoy did not come to the wall. He waited in the yard below, in the shade of the gun shed, as if he had learned that men who arrive with ceremony must not be rewarded with too much attention.

He sent for me instead.

When I climbed down from the wall, the smell of the yard hit me, familiar and grounding. Powder residue. Oiled rope. Damp wood. Sweat and iron.

The English brought different smells. Wool. Stale wine. Leather polished for inspection. They carried the scent of ships even on land, tar and salt trapped in their cloth.

---

They were led into the gun yard with a show of courtesy that was also a show of control.

The Travancore captain of the gate walked beside the senior Englishman, smiling politely. Behind them came two more English officers, a clerk with ink-stained fingers, and a thin Indian interpreter whose eyes darted between faces as if looking for a safe place to rest.

The senior officer introduced himself in careful Portuguese.

"Major Hawkins," he said, bowing slightly. "Honourable Company's service."

His accent was poor. The vowels slid around like fish. But the effort was deliberate. Portuguese still ruled the coast's trade tongues, and the Company liked to believe language itself could be conquered by will.

De Lannoy answered in Portuguese too, smoother, older, the Portuguese of a man who had spoken it in factories and chapels and under cannon smoke.

"Captain De Lannoy," he replied. He did not give his first name. He never did with Europeans. Names are doors. He kept his closed.

Hawkins looked relieved to find a European voice answering him. His gaze slid over De Lannoy's coat, his posture, his face.

Then his eyes found me.

I saw the moment of recognition, and something else behind it.

Asset.

Lever.

Possible weakness.

Hawkins' smile widened.

"Dutch," he said, switching awkwardly into English, as if he could not resist showing he possessed the newer language too. "By God, I thought so. I knew it by the nose."

The clerk laughed dutifully.

The Travancore captain smiled without understanding.

The Indian interpreter watched my face carefully, as if he expected me to explode.

I did not.

I bowed and kept my hands still.

De Lannoy glanced at me, a small look that meant, be useful.

Hawkins held out his hand.

In that moment I saw two possible lives.

One was the life the Company offered, always. A European among Europeans. A man who could speak the right words and drink the right toasts and pretend his hands had not been remade in a foreign gun yard.

The other was the life I had chosen, even if I had never admitted it aloud. A house by the backwaters. A wife whose hands smelled of fish and turmeric. Children who spoke Malayalam with the careless confidence of the born.

Hawkins' hand waited.

I took it.

His grip was soft.

"Brother," he said, and his eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

The word sat on my skin like oil.

---

They had come, officially, to discuss an alliance.

Unofficially, they had come to measure.

They walked the wall line as if it was already theirs. They tapped stone with knuckles, glanced down at the ditch, asked questions about powder stores with the casual tone of men asking about weather. Hawkins smiled often. His junior officers smiled too, but their smiles did not reach their eyes.

One of them, a lieutenant with a narrow face and a mouth that looked permanently dissatisfied, leaned close to me as we watched a gun drill.

"Is it true," he asked in English, "that the king pays this Frenchman like a prince?"

He said Frenchman as if it were the same as traitor.

I answered in English, measured. "He is paid as an officer. He has built the king's army."

The lieutenant's eyebrows rose. "A Dutchman defending a Frenchman. Remarkable."

His gaze flicked toward my hands. The calluses. The faint powder stain that never quite left the nails.

"And you," he said. "What are you paid, van der Berg?"

There are questions that are not questions. They are hooks.

I kept my eyes on the gun crew as they rammed home the charge.

"Enough," I said.

He smiled again. "Enough is seldom enough for a man with talent."

The gun fired. The recoil slammed back. The lieutenant flinched despite himself, and then recovered with a laugh.

"Magnificent," he said, as if he had expected the gun to obey his appreciation.

---

In the shed, De Lannoy spread his maps and powder tables and let the English look.

He did not give them everything. He never gave everything. He offered enough to satisfy their pride, enough to keep them talking, enough to make them believe they were extracting secrets.

Hendrik stood behind his father, expression controlled. Caspar lingered near the doorway like a bored dog.

Hawkins asked about cannon.

"How many eighteen-pounders on the west battery?" he asked in Portuguese.

De Lannoy answered in Malayalam to the Travancore captain instead of to Hawkins, forcing Hawkins to wait for translation. It was a small cruelty, and a useful one. It reminded the Englishman whose land he stood on.

The Travancore captain answered Hawkins politely, and then Hawkins turned to me.

"Your Malayalam is excellent," he said in English. "Quite remarkable for a Dutchman."

I said nothing.

Hawkins continued as if we were already friends.

"We have need of men like you," he said. "Men who can speak to natives and still think like Europeans."

Still.

The word was a knife.

I translated a sentence for the Travancore captain and felt my jaw tighten. De Lannoy watched me from the corner of his eye.

Hawkins leaned closer.

"You should come to Madras," he said softly. "We pay properly. We promote properly. A man does not have to spend his life as a servant of heathen kings."

I heard the contempt under the politeness. He did not hate Travancore. Hate is too honest. He simply assumed it was temporary, a local inconvenience that would eventually be corrected by Company order.

I thought of Lakshmi.

If Hawkins had seen her, he would have smiled again. He would have called her picturesque. He would have spoken of her as if she was part of the scenery, like palm trees and elephants.

I looked at him and answered with the only weapon I had in that moment, truth delivered flatly.

"My children are here," I said. "My wife is here."

Hawkins' smile did not falter. It only changed.

"Ah," he said. "Entanglements."

He said it kindly, as if my life was a mistake he forgave me for making.

"Those can be managed," he continued. "Arrangements can be made. We have chaplains. We have settlements. Your children could be educated properly."

Properly.

Another knife.

I saw, in a flash, the future he offered. My son in an English coat, taught to be ashamed of his mother. My daughter taught to speak English first and Malayalam second, as if one tongue was clean and the other was dirt.

My hands clenched, then forced themselves to relax.

De Lannoy spoke then, in Portuguese, sharp enough to cut through Hawkins' soft voice.

"Major," he said, "if you have come to talk, talk to the king. If you have come to buy men, go to the markets."

Hawkins laughed, as if De Lannoy had made a joke.

"Of course," he said. "Of course. Purely professional."

He patted my shoulder lightly, as if sealing our private understanding.

The touch made my skin crawl.

---

When they left the shed, they asked to see the powder magazine.

De Lannoy refused.

He did it politely. He did it with reasons. He did it as if he were protecting the English from danger, because powder is temperamental and a careless spark can make heroes out of fools.

Hawkins accepted the refusal with a smile that was too smooth.

"Naturally," he said. "Naturally. One must be cautious."

But I saw the way his eyes tracked the wall thickness as we walked. I saw the way his clerk wrote down numbers he should not have been able to obtain. I saw the way the dissatisfied lieutenant studied our gun crews as if counting how many could be bribed.

The Company did not always arrive with cannon.

Sometimes it arrived with notebooks.

---

They were lodged that night in Padmanabhapuram, and the fort breathed easier when their red coats disappeared from the gate.

In the yard, men began to talk again. The gunners spat and made jokes about English stomachs and English noses. Caspar mimicked Hawkins' Portuguese accent until even Hendrik's mouth twitched.

De Lannoy did not laugh.

He stood with me under the eaves, watching the last smoke drift away from the guns.

"They want you," he said in Dutch.

It was not an accusation.

It was a warning.

I stared at the darkening yard. "They think I am one of them," I replied.

De Lannoy's face stayed still. "And what do you think?"

The question was simple, and it had no safe answer.

I thought of the Englishman's hand on my arm. Brother.
I thought of my children's voices mixing languages without shame.
I thought of the rocket fragments in the bowl.

"I think," I said slowly, "that they are polite because they have not yet decided whether they will need to kill us."

De Lannoy's mouth tightened. It might have been approval, or grief.

"Good," he said. "Keep thinking like that."

He turned back toward the shed.

"Tomorrow," he added, "we drill twice."

---

That night, at home, Lakshmi listened while I spoke.

She did not interrupt. She did not gasp at the idea of English offers. She did not ask whether I was tempted.

When I finished, she took a pinch of salt and rubbed it into the fish as if salt could fix what words could not.

"They looked at you like a thing," she said finally.

She understood predation. Every woman does.

"Yes," I admitted.

Lakshmi nodded, as if the answer confirmed what she already knew.

"Then you must learn to be a thing that bites," she said.

She said it calmly, the way she said everything that mattered.

Outside, the backwater was dark and still.

Somewhere beyond the trees, in places I could not see, men were counting too.

# Chapter 12: The Liaison

There are many ways to betray a man.

You can do it with a knife, quick and honest.
You can do it with a coin, slow and smiling.
You can do it with a word, which is the easiest way of all, because words can pretend they are harmless even while they kill.

I learned that in Travancore, where my tongue became as useful as my hands.

---

Two days after the English visited Udayagiri, a palace messenger arrived with a palm-leaf note sealed in wax.

It was not addressed to De Lannoy.

It was addressed to me.

The wax seal bore the mark of the Dalawa.

Raja Kesavadas.

De Lannoy read it and handed it back without expression.

"Go," he said in Dutch. "Listen. Then come back and tell me what they really said."

He did not need to explain who they were. In the fort, the word English had started to feel like smoke. Not choking yet, but present in every breath.

I rode south to Padmanabhapuram with a small escort, through lanes shaded by coconut palms and past rice fields that glittered with water. The land looked peaceful. Men were planting. Women were washing cloth on stones. Children ran barefoot, shouting.

Peace is always the first disguise of war.

---

The palace gates swallowed sound.

Outside, the world had been wet and alive. Inside, the air held still, thick with sandalwood and lamp smoke. The stone floors were cool underfoot. Servants moved like shadows, carrying brass trays, speaking in murmurs.

I was led through corridors where carved pillars loomed like dark trees. Painted figures watched from panels, gods and kings and demons frozen mid-gesture.

At the end of the corridor a curtain lifted, and I was shown into a room that was not large but felt heavy with power.

Raja Kesavadas sat on a low seat with a writing board beside him. He was not dressed like a warrior. His cloth was plain, his jewellery minimal. He looked like a man who had stepped out of an account book and learned to breathe.

His eyes were the dangerous part. They did not rest. They assessed.

On one side of the room stood Major Hawkins, the same red coat and polished boots, his smile intact. Behind him hovered his narrow-faced lieutenant and the clerk with ink-stained fingers.

On the other side sat two Travancore ministers, older men with controlled faces, and a Brahmin priest whose forehead marks were as sharp as his stare.

Kesavadas looked at me.

"Pieter," he said in Malayalam, pronouncing my name carefully, as if testing whether it could be shaped into something local.

"Yes, Dalawa," I replied.

He nodded and gestured toward Hawkins.

"You will translate," he said.

It was not a request.

---

Hawkins began with compliments.

He praised the king's wisdom. He praised Travancore's discipline. He praised the walls at Udayagiri and the guns that guarded them.

I translated his words into Malayalam, and while I spoke I watched Kesavadas' face.

Kesavadas did not smile. He listened as if compliments were another kind of measurement.

When Hawkins finished, Kesavadas responded with courtesy that was also a warning.

He welcomed the Company as friends. He thanked them for their concern. He spoke of shared interests in stability and trade.

I translated into English, choosing words that would not make Hawkins bristle.

This was my first lesson of the day.

Translation is not honesty. It is negotiation.

---

Hawkins moved quickly from praise to need.

"Mysore threatens the peace of the coast," he said, voice smooth. "Hyder Ali is a disruptive element. A man who does not understand proper treaties."

Disruptive element.

As if war was a stain on a tablecloth.

I translated into Malayalam. The word disruptive came out as something closer to plague.

The Brahmin priest shifted slightly, displeased, as if he did not want even plague spoken inside a royal room.

Hawkins continued.

"The Company is prepared to support Travancore," he said. "We can offer advice, powder, trained officers. In return, we would ask for certain assurances."

Assurances.

I translated.

Kesavadas nodded. "Assurances," he repeated in Malayalam, tasting the word as if it might be poisoned.

He asked Hawkins, politely, what assurances the Company required.

Hawkins did not hesitate.

"Access," he said. "To ports. To roads. To supply."

His lieutenant leaned forward slightly, as if scenting blood.

"A permanent resident at court would be helpful," Hawkins added. "A man to facilitate communication."

The room stayed still.

The Brahmin priest's eyes sharpened.

I translated the sentence and felt sweat gather at the base of my spine.

A resident at court.

The Company had learned, long ago, that cannons are less effective than clerks.

Kesavadas asked, calm, what a resident would do.

Hawkins smiled.

"Observe," he said. "Advise. Ensure misunderstandings do not occur."

Misunderstandings.

I translated that too, and in Malayalam it sounded like, ensure disobedience does not occur.

Kesavadas leaned back slightly.

His gaze shifted to me, and for a heartbeat I thought he was looking through my skin, weighing not my words but my presence.

Then he turned back to Hawkins.

"Travancore understands friendship," Kesavadas said. "But it does not invite friends to sleep inside its walls."

His Malayalam was polite. The meaning was not.

I translated into English with careful softness.

"We welcome cooperation," I said, "but the court does not permit foreign residences within the palace precincts."

Hawkins' smile tightened.

"Of course," he said. "Not within the palace. That would be improper. Perhaps in Padmanabhapuram town. A small office. A few clerks."

Small.
Few.

Words that were meant to sound harmless.

I translated, and Kesavadas' expression did not change.

He asked, still calmly, how many clerks were few.

Hawkins laughed lightly. "As many as necessary."

I did not translate the laugh. I translated the words.

Kesavadas nodded as if he had received an honest answer.

---

For two hours we moved through sentences that were traps.

The Company asked for rights that sounded like conveniences.
Travancore offered courtesies that were really boundaries.
Hawkins spoke of mutual benefit. Kesavadas spoke of mutual respect.

In between them I stood, turning poison into perfume, turning threats into polite requests, turning refusals into regretful apologies.

At one point Hawkins said, in English, "Surely the Dalawa understands that the Company cannot commit resources without guarantees."

Guarantees.

The word had the weight of a cannonball.

I translated it as assurances again, because guarantees would have sounded like a rope tightening.

Hawkins glanced at me, quick and sharp. He had noticed.

His voice stayed pleasant.

"Mr van der Berg," he said, "you are very good at your work."

I bowed slightly. "Thank you, Major."

His eyes held mine.

"Do you understand what is being discussed?" he asked.

It was a question meant for the room, but it was aimed at me like a musket.

I answered in English, evenly. "Yes."

Hawkins nodded, satisfied, and turned back to Kesavadas as if I had just confirmed his suspicion.

Kesavadas watched that exchange without moving.

Then, calmly, he ended the meeting.

He spoke of consulting the king. He spoke of prayer and deliberation. He thanked the Company for its concern and promised a formal response.

Hawkins bowed. The lieutenant bowed. The clerk bowed.

Courtesy, like soldiers stacking arms.

---

When the English left the room, Kesavadas did not dismiss me.

He dismissed the ministers and the priest first.

Only when the room was empty of everyone but him and me did he speak again.

This time he did not use Portuguese. He did not use the polished Malayalam of court.

He spoke in the plain Malayalam of a man who had grown up among soldiers and merchants.

"They want a resident," he said. "They want eyes inside our house."

I nodded. It felt safer than speaking.

Kesavadas watched me for a long moment.

"They called you brother," he said, as if he were stating an established fact.

Heat rose in my face. I forced myself to meet his gaze.

"They call many things brother," I said. "They call pepper brother when they want it cheap."

Kesavadas' mouth twitched, the smallest possible smile, gone almost as soon as it appeared.

He leaned forward slightly.

"Tell me something, Pieter," he said.

His voice stayed calm, but the room felt suddenly tighter.

"When they stop asking," he said, "and start taking, where will you stand?"

The question did not belong to language. It belonged to blood.

I thought of my children. Willem's questions. Anna's sharp eyes. Little Thomas asleep with his mouth open, trusting the world because he had not yet seen what it does to men.

I thought of Lakshmi telling me to become a thing that bites.

I thought of De Lannoy, a man who had crossed from enemy to architect and paid for it in loneliness.

I took a breath and answered slowly, because a quick answer would have been a lie.

"I will stand where my life is," I said. "Here. On your wall. In my house. Between my children and any man who thinks he can take them."

Kesavadas' gaze held on me.

"That is not a neat answer," he said.

"No," I agreed.

He sat back.

"Neat answers are for men who have never been conquered," he said. "Or men who are planning to conquer."

He picked up his writing board and tapped it once, thoughtful.

"The Company will not disappear," he continued. "Hyder will not disappear. We must choose the order in which we are bitten."

He looked at me again, eyes hard now.

"You will translate for them again," he said.

My throat tightened.

It was not an honour. It was a chain, forged out of usefulness.

"Yes, Dalawa," I said.

Kesavadas nodded, satisfied.

"Remember this," he said. "You are not only translating words. You are translating intentions. If you soften too much, we become fools. If you sharpen too much, we become enemies."

He paused, then added, almost casually, "And if you ever decide you belong to them, tell me first."

The threat was not in the words. It was in the calmness.

I bowed.

When I left the room, my back was damp with sweat.

In the corridor, the painted gods watched me pass.

I realised, with a chill that had nothing to do with the palace's cool stone, that I had been given a role that could not be refused.

I had been captured once with ropes.

Now I was being held with work.

# Chapter 13: Caspar's Fire

Powder wants to burn.

It sits in barrels in the dark like a patient animal, waiting for the smallest excuse. A spark. A careless match. A lantern set down too close. A boy who thinks he is immune to consequences because consequences have not yet bitten him.

We spend our lives pretending we control it.

That is what makes men arrogant around guns. A cannon obeys drill. It obeys the sponge and the rammer and the rhythm of commands. It does not show its teeth until it does.

After Mysore began to smell like smoke, De Lannoy ordered the magazine filled.

More powder. More shot. More spare rope. More wedges.

More everything that can kill you if you forget it is waiting.

---

The powder arrived on ox carts from the east, guarded as if it were gold.

In a way, it was.

The barrels were stamped with marks from places I had only seen on maps. Coimbatore. Salem. Names that meant nothing to the men in the yard, but meant routes, and distances, and time. The kind of time you do not have when an army begins to move.

Hendrik supervised the unloading with the cold precision he brought to drill.

"No lanterns near the barrels," he snapped. "No iron nails in the planks. No smoking, not even in the outer yard. If I smell tobacco I will have your tongue cut out."

The men laughed uneasily, because Hendrik was young enough that they still expected threats to be performance.

I did not laugh.

I had seen what powder can do when it stops being patient.

Caspar leaned against the shed post and watched the carts roll in as if it was all beneath him. He rolled a nut between his fingers, quick and idle, and his gaze flicked from barrel to barrel, bored.

That was his way when he was worried.

De Lannoy came down to the yard late, walking slower than he used to, his joints stiff in the damp heat. He watched the new barrels stacked in the magazine corridor and said nothing at first.

Then he looked at me and spoke in Dutch.

"Too much," he said.

He did not mean too much powder.

He meant too much faith in storage. Too much belief that a full magazine is safety rather than risk.

"We need it," I said.

"We need it alive," he replied. "Powder that explodes is not powder. It is funerals."

He turned to the Travancore captain and repeated the instruction in Malayalam, quick and sharp. More guards. No lamps. No careless hands.

Then he left, as if he had said all that could be said.

---

The fire started at midday.

The yard was loud with ordinary work. A carriage wheel being tarred. A gun crew practising sponge and ram without firing. A mule braying as someone tightened a strap too hard.

I was in the shed with a powder table spread before me, trying to calculate how long our increased stock would last if the king doubled the drills again. Numbers steadied me. They always had.

Then a sound cut through the yard, wrong and high.

"Fire!"

The shout came from the magazine corridor.

For a heartbeat, my mind refused it. Fire in a fort is always possible. Fire in a village is ordinary. Fire near a powder magazine is a kind of ending.

I was on my feet before thought caught up.

Outside, men were running toward the magazine, then stopping short as if they had hit a wall.

Smoke curled from the magazine doorway, thin and grey at first, then thicker, darker, carrying the sharp sting of burning cloth and the bitter tang of powder.

A guard stood at the door, eyes wide, hands shaking. He had a bucket in one hand and did not know whether to throw it or run.

Hendrik was there, barking orders, but his voice had a crack in it.

"Back," he shouted. "Back, you fools. Get away from the corridor. Get to the wall, now."

Men froze, caught between obedience and the instinct to stare at disaster.

Someone tried to push past Hendrik toward the door, and Hendrik slammed him back with his forearm.

"Do you want to die here?" he roared. "There will be nothing left of you to bury."

That was when De Lannoy appeared.

He did not run. He did not shout. He came out of the inner yard at a measured pace, crop in hand, his face unreadable.

He looked at the smoke and then at the men, and in that glance he took command.

"Buckets," he said in Malayalam. "Not one. Not two. Fifty. Now."

He pointed the crop at the well.

"Form a chain," he said. "From the well to the door. No running. If you run, you spill. If you spill, you feed the fire."

His voice stayed calm. That calmness steadied the yard more than any shouting could have.

Men moved. Hands grabbed buckets. A line began to form, ragged at first, then tightening as Hendrik and the Travancore captain snapped it into shape.

De Lannoy stepped toward the magazine door.

Hendrik grabbed his arm.

"Father," he said, and for once the word was not hidden behind discipline.

De Lannoy did not look at him. "Let go," he said.

Hendrik's fingers loosened.

De Lannoy walked to the door, stopped, and listened.

That was what made him terrifying. In a moment when every nerve screamed run, he listened, as if he could hear the size of the fire in the sound it made.

Inside the magazine, something crackled.

Not the sharp crack of a gun firing.

The dry hungry crackle of cloth and wood burning.

De Lannoy looked back at me.

"If it reaches the barrels," he said in Dutch, quiet enough that only I heard, "we will not have time to pray."

I nodded. I had already done the arithmetic.

A magazine explosion does not kill men.

It erases them.

---

Caspar pushed through the crowd.

He did not say anything. He did not ask permission. He moved with the sudden focus of a man who has finally found something that makes him feel alive.

Hendrik stepped in front of him.

"Stay back," he said, voice hard. "This is not a joke."

Caspar looked at his brother and smiled, a quick flash of teeth.

"Of course it is not a joke," he said. "That is why it is interesting."

Then he shoved Hendrik aside and headed for the door.

"Caspar!" Hendrik shouted.

De Lannoy's head turned slightly, and for a moment I saw something in his face.

Fear.

Not for himself.

For his son.

Caspar reached the door as the first bucket arrived.

A gunner in the chain thrust it toward him, hands shaking.

Caspar took it and threw it into the doorway without hesitation.

The water hit something inside and hissed.

Smoke billowed out thicker, and Caspar stepped forward into it.

Men shouted. Someone grabbed at his sleeve and missed.

Caspar disappeared into the smoke like a man stepping into a storm.

---

I moved without deciding.

Not into the doorway. I was not brave like Caspar. I was careful like a man who had lived long enough to understand that courage can be waste.

But I moved close enough to see.

Inside the magazine corridor, a stack of empty packing crates had caught fire. The flame was small, contained, but it was licking upward toward the shelves where the new powder barrels had been stacked too close.

The smell was wrong. The wood smelled like ordinary burning. Under it was the sharper smell of spilled powder, a thin trail on the floor that glimmered like black sand.

If the flame found that trail, it would run.

Caspar was on his knees in the smoke, beating at the crates with his hands, slapping flame as if it were an insult.

He should have used cloth. He should have used wet blankets.

He had not thought.

His palms hit the burning wood and he jerked back, a sharp involuntary motion.

Then he hit it again.

He had a bucket beside him now. He scooped water with his bare hands and flung it at the base of the fire, not enough to drown it but enough to slow it.

"Barrels!" he shouted into the corridor, voice hoarse. "Move the barrels. Now. Do not stand there looking stupid."

The men closest to the door hesitated.

Not from cowardice.

From calculation.

Every gunner knows the distance a magazine blast can throw stone. Every man in the yard was doing the same silent math.

If I go in and it explodes, my wife will be a widow and my children will become beggars.

Caspar looked back at them through the smoke, eyes bright.

"If it explodes, you die anyway," he shouted. "You will just die outside like polite men."

That broke something in them.

Two gunners surged forward, cloth wrapped around their hands, and grabbed the nearest powder barrel.

They moved like men carrying a sleeping child, careful and fast at the same time.

Caspar shoved the burning crates away from the spill trail, pushing them with his forearm as if pain was irrelevant.

He caught the trail of powder with a handful of water, turning it into black paste.

The paste did not burn.

The air hissed, thick with steam and smoke.

Outside, the bucket chain began to work properly. Water flowed hand to hand, steady now. Men stopped running. They started obeying.

I watched the fire shrink under water and force, and in that watching I saw something with a clarity that made my stomach tighten.

This was what De Lannoy had seen in me at Colachel.

Not skill.

Not loyalty.

Instinct.

The ability to move when other men freeze.

That ability saves forts.

It also destroys men.

---

The fire died slowly, stubbornly.

Not all of it. Not at first.

One crate flared again when a wet board shifted and exposed a pocket of embers. Caspar slapped it out with his bare hand and made a sound that might have been laughter and might have been pain.

By the time the smoke thinned enough to see the magazine shelves properly, Caspar's hands were red and blistered. The skin on his palms had gone slick in places, as if it had been boiled.

He did not look at his hands.

He looked at the shelves.

The powder barrels were wet. Not soaked, not ruined, but wet enough that Hendrik swore under his breath.

Powder hates water. It clumps. It spoils. A wet magazine is an expensive mistake.

But a blown magazine is a kingdom's death.

De Lannoy stepped into the corridor at last, once the fire was nothing but blackened wood and steam.

He moved slowly, because he was old and because haste in a magazine is how men die.

He looked at the damaged crates, the wet powder trail, the soot on the ceiling.

Then his gaze went to Caspar.

Caspar stood there, chest heaving, smoke in his hair, his hands held slightly away from his body as if he did not trust them.

De Lannoy said nothing for a long moment.

Hendrik started to speak, anger and relief tangled in his voice.

"He went in like a fool," he said. "He could have killed everyone."

Caspar looked at his brother, eyes narrow.

"Yes," he said. "And I did not."

De Lannoy lifted his crop and tapped Hendrik's chest lightly.

"Enough," he said in Malayalam.

He stepped closer to Caspar.

For a moment I expected praise. I expected a father's hand on a son's shoulder. I expected words that might soften Caspar's face and give him a reason to live that was not danger.

De Lannoy did not give him that.

He took Caspar's wrist gently and turned his hand palm up.

The blisters were already rising, pale against red skin.

De Lannoy's mouth tightened.

"You have hands like a gunner," he said, voice quiet. "You must keep them."

Caspar tried to pull his wrist away.

"It is nothing," he said.

De Lannoy held on, firm now.

"It is not nothing," he said.

He released Caspar's wrist and turned to the healer who had arrived, breathless, with cloth and salve.

"Treat him," De Lannoy ordered. "Now."

Then he walked out of the magazine without looking back.

It was the closest thing to tenderness he allowed himself.

---

By evening, the yard smelled of wet ash.

The gunners moved quietly, sobered. Men who had watched death almost happen do not speak loudly for a while. They glance at each other differently. They touch their children harder when they go home.

Hendrik had the damaged powder barrels rolled out to the sun and the seals checked. He had scribes note losses. He had men scrape soot from the ceiling. His mind moved immediately to repair.

Caspar vanished.

That was his pattern too.

He appeared when danger gave him a shape, then disappeared when the shape dissolved and left only feeling behind.

I found him after dark in a shed by the outer wall where the gunners sometimes drank when they wanted to forget they were mortal.

A small lamp burned there, shielded, the flame enclosed. No one would dare open fire in a fort after a day like this.

Caspar sat on an upturned crate with a cup in his good hand.

Arrack.

It smelled of sugar and rot.

He drank as if he had been thirsty his whole life.

When he raised the cup, his burned hand trembled so hard the liquid sloshed.

He noticed my eyes and curled his fingers inward, hiding the tremor.

"Come to lecture me?" he asked, voice too casual.

I sat on another crate and said nothing at first. Smoke still clung to my hair. My throat still tasted of ash.

"You did well," I said finally.

Caspar snorted. "I did not die," he replied. "That is not the same thing."

"It is sometimes the same thing," I said.

He stared at the cup.

"When I ran in," he said quietly, "I did not think of anything. Not my father. Not Hendrik. Not the fort. Not even myself."

He flexed his fingers and winced, quick and involuntary.

"I only thought, this is fire, and I hate it," he said. "Fire takes what it wants."

His voice roughened.

"It took men at Colachel," he continued. "It took our powder. It took my father's sleep. It took my mother's laughter."

His eyes lifted to mine.

"It will take us too," he said. "One day. It always does."

I did not contradict him. Contradiction is cheap comfort.

Caspar drank again, then set the cup down carefully, as if his hand could not be trusted.

"Do not tell my father about the shaking," he said abruptly.

There it was.

Not fear of death.

Fear of being seen as weak.

"He already knows," I said.

Caspar's mouth twisted. "He knows everything. He pretends he does not."

He held his burned hands in the lamplight, studying the blisters as if they belonged to someone else.

"Hendrik thinks discipline is a wall," he said. "He thinks if he builds it high enough, nothing gets in."

He looked up again, the restlessness back in his eyes.

"I think discipline is just a way to die neatly," he said.

He laughed once, sharp and bitter.

"And I do not want to die neatly," he said. "If I die, I want it to mean something."

His burned fingers clenched, then loosened.

In that movement I saw the cost of his courage.

The fire had not killed him.

It had entered him.

---

When I left the shed, the fort was quiet.

The stars were sharp above the wall, cold and indifferent. The backwater below the fort lay black and still.

In the gun yard, the magazine door stood closed, and for the first time in my life I felt grateful for a heavy wooden door.

I went home and found Lakshmi awake, sitting in the doorway with a lamp beside her, waiting.

She touched my hair and smelled the smoke.

"Fire," she said.

I nodded.

Lakshmi's gaze went to my hands, checking without asking.

"Not you," she murmured.

"Caspar," I said.

Lakshmi's mouth tightened. "The reckless one."

"The brave one," I replied.

Lakshmi looked at me, and in her eyes I saw something that made my chest feel tight.

Pity.

Not for Caspar's burns.

For the hunger beneath them.

"Bravery is expensive," she said quietly. "It always demands payment."

She reached for my hand and held it, steady.

"Make sure he does not pay with his whole life," she added.

Outside, the fort's walls held the night.

Inside them, we were storing powder and pretending we controlled fire.


# Chapter 14: Pepper and Lead

Pepper gets into everything.

It clings to cloth. It settles in hair. It hides under fingernails. In warehouses it floats in the air as dust, and if you breathe too deeply you cough and your eyes water, and you understand, in your body, why men crossed oceans for this small black seed.

In Batavia, pepper was counted like scripture. Sacks, weights, percentages, losses, bribes. A man's life could be measured in spice.

In Travancore I learned that war could be measured the same way.

Not in battles.

In account books.

Ramayyan had turned Mavelikara into a counting house for a kingdom, and the lesson had spread. Pepper was no longer only spice. It was lead, wages, and walls.

---

The week after the magazine fire, De Lannoy sent me to Padmanabhapuram again.

Not to speak with Major Hawkins.

To speak with the Company's men who did not wear red coats.

The ones who carried ink instead of swords.

They were waiting in a warehouse near the palace compound, a long low building with thick walls meant to keep out damp. Inside, pepper sacks were stacked to the ceiling in neat rows, each marked with chalk symbols. The air was sharp with spice and sweat. Men moved quietly, rolling sacks onto scales, calling out weights to a scribe who wrote without looking up.

The scribe's palm-leaf board was as important as any cannon.

Raja Kesavadas stood near the scale, hands clasped behind his back. He watched the weighing with the same attention I had seen on his face when he watched the English try to slide their hooks into court.

When he saw me, he nodded.

"Pieter," he said. "Come."

On the far side of the warehouse stood a Company agent in plain cloth, not uniform. His coat was dark, his boots clean, his hair powdered in a way that looked absurd in the humid air. He held a handkerchief to his nose as if the smell of pepper was an offence.

Beside him stood an Indian clerk with a bundle of papers tied in string, and two armed sepoys whose eyes scanned the warehouse as if looking for something to shoot.

The agent smiled at me when I approached.

"Mr van der Berg," he said in English, and he pronounced my name carefully, as if proving he could. "We meet again. I am Mr Fraser."

He said it as if the name should carry weight.

Perhaps it did in Madras.

Here it was only a sound in spice dust.

Kesavadas gestured for me to stand between them.

"Translate," he said.

There was no ceremony now. No priests. No ministers. Only pepper, men with pens, and a Company agent who wanted to pretend he was discussing trade instead of power.

---

Fraser began with numbers.

"The Company has assessed the situation," he said, voice smooth. "Mysore's disruptions have made certain routes unsafe. Saltpetre shipments are delayed. Lead is scarce."

I translated into Malayalam, choosing words that did not make it sound like the Company was doing Travancore a favour. In Malayalam, favour and trap are too close.

Kesavadas listened and said nothing.

Fraser continued.

"However," he said, and his smile widened, "the Company is prepared to assist its friends. We can provide saltpetre and lead at favourable rates. We can ensure supply reaches Udayagiri without incident."

Without incident.

As if the Company controlled roads the way it controlled paper.

I translated.

Kesavadas finally spoke.

"The Company is generous," he said in Malayalam.

I translated into English as, "The Company is kind."

Kindness is what men call a knife before they feel it.

Fraser nodded, pleased.

"We do what we can," he said. "Of course, assistance requires arrangements."

Arrangements again.

He pulled one of the tied bundles from his clerk and untied it with deliberate care, as if he was unveiling sacred objects.

"Pepper," he said, tapping a column on the paper. "Travancore produces the finest pepper on the coast. The Company is prepared to purchase in large quantities, in advance, which will provide the court with ready silver."

Advance payments.

Another hook.

I translated into Malayalam. Kesavadas' face did not change.

Fraser leaned in slightly.

"In return," he said, "we would ask for a guarantee of supply at a fixed price. Stable. Predictable."

Predictable for him.

I translated.

Kesavadas lifted his hand slightly, and one of the warehouse men stopped rolling sacks.

The silence was thick.

"You want pepper and you want prices," Kesavadas said. "You want both fixed. Like cannon on a wall."

His Malayalam was plain, almost conversational, but there was steel under it.

I translated.

Fraser's smile tightened, then returned.

"We want fairness," he said. "The Company offers protection and stability. These are valuable."

Protection.

The word tasted rotten to me.

I had grown up under a Company too. I knew what protection meant when the books were involved.

Kesavadas nodded slowly.

"Protection is valuable," he agreed.

Then he added, in the same calm tone, "But so is pepper."

I translated.

Fraser spread his hands. "Exactly," he said. "We should work together."

Kesavadas gestured toward the scale.

"How much does a man weigh?" he asked suddenly, in Malayalam.

The warehouse men glanced up, startled.

I hesitated, then translated the question into English because the question was not about weight.

Fraser blinked, confused. "A man?" he repeated. "I beg your pardon."

Kesavadas did not look at him. He looked at me.

"Tell him," he said.

So I told him, because it was what Kesavadas wanted made plain.

"A man weighs as much as his bones and his blood," I said in English. "But a king weighs him in wages and rice. In powder to protect him. In silver to bury him."

Fraser's eyes narrowed. He was beginning to understand that he was not in a Madras office.

Kesavadas spoke again, calm.

"We lost powder last week," he said. "We nearly lost a magazine. If we lose another, we lose Udayagiri. If we lose Udayagiri, we lose the line. If we lose the line, we lose the kingdom."

He pointed at the pepper sacks.

"So yes," he said. "Pepper is valuable. It buys lead. It buys saltpetre. It buys the wages that keep men on the wall when rockets scream."

I translated, and as I spoke I saw Fraser's expression shift.

This was the truth he did not want named.

Pepper was not a luxury.

It was ammunition.

---

Fraser recovered quickly. Company men always do.

"Then we agree," he said. "The Company will supply what is needed. In return, we ask only that Travancore commit its pepper to us first. To avoid misunderstandings."

First.

That was the real word.

First meant monopoly without saying monopoly.

Kesavadas smiled, and it was the most dangerous thing in the room.

"Travancore has committed its pepper to many men over many years," he said. "The Dutch. The Portuguese. The Arabs. The Jews. The kings of the coast. All have wanted pepper. All have promised fairness."

He looked at Fraser directly for the first time.

"Tell me," he said, and his voice stayed polite, "what happened to the Dutch?"

I translated.

Fraser's smile faltered for a fraction, then returned with effort.

"The Dutch have declined," he said. "Circumstances change. The Company adapts."

Kesavadas nodded. "Yes," he said. "Circumstances change."

He let the words hang.

Then he spoke again, and his tone stayed gentle.

"Travancore will buy your saltpetre," he said. "Travancore will buy your lead. Travancore will pay in silver and pepper."

Fraser relaxed, thinking he had won.

Kesavadas continued.

"Travancore will not give you first rights," he said. "Travancore will not fix its pepper price to suit Madras. Travancore will not place its throat in your hand and call it friendship."

The warehouse men held their breath.

I translated into English as smoothly as I could. I softened throat into neck. It was still a threat. It was simply a well-mannered one.

Fraser's face tightened.

"Dalawa," he began, and the title sounded awkward in his mouth, "you must understand the Company's position."

Kesavadas interrupted, voice still calm.

"I understand it very well," he said. "That is why I am refusing."

I translated.

For a moment the room felt as if it might crack like a gun barrel under too much powder.

Then Fraser smiled again, and the smile had changed.

"Of course," he said. "Of course. We are only discussing possibilities."

Possibilities.

Another word for pressure.

He gathered his papers with controlled movements.

"We will make our offer in writing," he said. "The Company values clarity."

Kesavadas nodded as if he approved of clarity.

"So do I," he replied.

---

When Fraser left, the warehouse exhaled.

Men went back to rolling sacks. The scale creaked again. The scribe's reed scratched on palm leaf.

Kesavadas watched the work for a while, silent.

Then he looked at me.

"You have seen this before," he said.

I answered anyway.

"Yes," I said in Malayalam. "In Batavia. In Colombo. In the places where a Company decides that trade is the same thing as rule."

Kesavadas nodded slowly.

"Our kings have always fought with swords and elephants," he said. "Now we must fight with paper."

He gestured toward the pepper sacks.

"And with pepper," he added.

I wanted to laugh, but it would have been hollow.

Instead I asked the question that had been nagging me since the magazine fire.

"How much will the king spend on powder now?" I said. "After the loss."

Kesavadas' gaze went toward the palace compound, as if he could see through walls to the king himself.

"As much as he must," he said.

He paused, then added quietly, "And more than he wants."

That was the truth of war.

Not the bravery.

Not the banners.

The spending.

The choices made in rooms that smell of pepper dust and ink.

That evening, when I returned to Udayagiri, Hendrik met me at the gate and asked, immediately, whether the saltpetre would come.

I told him yes.

He asked what it would cost.

I told him, honestly, that the cost would not fit in any column.

Hendrik stared at me as if I had spoken nonsense.

Then he turned away to inspect the gun line, already thinking of drills, of range tables, of things he could control.

In the yard, a boy rolled a powder barrel toward the shed, careful now, eyes wide, as if he had learned what a spark can do.

Pepper buys lead.

Lead buys time.

Time runs out.

# Chapter 15: Prisoners of Mysore

I had been a prisoner once.

That memory never left. It sat behind my eyes like smoke, thin most days, thicker when I was tired, choking when I smelled wet rope or heard men speak Dutch in anger.

Prisoner is a word that sounds simple.

In truth it is a room inside the mind. It is the knowledge that your body is no longer yours. It is the humiliation of waiting for someone else to decide whether you are useful.

When the Mysorean prisoners were brought into Udayagiri, I understood them too well.

---

They came at dusk, escorted by Travancore cavalry, their hands tied with coir rope.

There were five of them, and one was dead before he reached the gate. His head lolled on his chest, chin slick with blood. The rope kept him upright as if the fort did not know what to do with a corpse that still walked.

The living four did not speak.

That was what struck me first.

Bandits talk. They curse. They brag. They spit defiance because defiance costs nothing when you have already decided you will die.

These men held their silence like a discipline.

They wore cloth stained with travel and sweat, but their belts were tight, their knots clean. Their hair was bound. Their beards were trimmed. One man, older than the rest, stood with his shoulders back even with rope biting his wrists. His gaze moved over the fort walls with the same attention a gunner gives a battery.

He was measuring.

Hendrik met them in the yard with a face like stone.

"Where were they taken?" he asked the escort captain.

"Near the northern road," the captain replied. "Scouts. Rocket men."

The word rocket made the gunners in the yard mutter. Men turned their heads away as if the prisoners carried fire in their mouths.

The older prisoner heard the word in Malayalam and his eyes sharpened. He did not flinch. He did not look ashamed.

He looked proud.

De Lannoy arrived late, moving slowly, his limp worse in the evening damp. He looked at the prisoners as if they were cannon to be evaluated.

Then he spoke to me in Dutch.

"Question them," he said. "Not with shouting. With listening."

He turned to Hendrik and spoke in Malayalam.

"Feed them," he ordered. "Water first."

Hendrik's mouth tightened. He wanted to punish. He wanted the fort to feel in control. Feeding prisoners felt like softness.

De Lannoy gave him a look that ended the argument.

Hendrik snapped an order. A bucket of water was brought.

The prisoners watched it as if it might be poison.

I stepped forward with a ladle and held it out to the older man first.

He hesitated, then drank, slow and careful.

When he finished, he looked at me.

"Parangi," he said in a low voice.

The word again.

Foreigner.

Outsider.

He said it without contempt, almost with interest, as if he was trying to understand what I was.

"Yes," I replied in Malayalam. "And you are Mysore."

His mouth twitched slightly. "We are Hyder Sahib's men," he said.

Hyder.

Hyder was not a king, not by blood, not by old law. Yet his soldiers spoke his name as if it made him inevitable.

---

We took them into the shed, away from the yard's staring eyes.

The shed was my refuge and my prison both. It held maps, range tables, powder records. It held the quiet work of preparation. It also held the truth that preparation is never enough.

The prisoners were made to sit on the floor.

The dead man was laid outside.

The older prisoner watched me as I sat opposite him on a low stool. His wrists were still tied, but his posture stayed straight.

"Your name," I said.

He hesitated, then answered.

"Abdul Karim," he said. "*Havildar*."

Sergeant.

A man who makes other men obey.

That explained the straight back.

"How long have you served?" I asked.

"Since I had hair on my face," he replied.

He glanced at my coat, at the way I held myself.

"And you?" he asked. "How long have you served your king?"

It was not a question meant for politeness. It was a probe.

I answered carefully.

"Long enough," I said.

His eyes narrowed. He understood evasion. Sergeants live on it.

"Why were you on our road?" I asked, shifting him back.

Abdul Karim looked at the floor as if deciding which truth to offer.

"We were watching," he said. "Hyder Sahib wants to know where powder moves."

The simplicity of it chilled me.

Not temples.
Not plunder.

Powder.

I thought of the pepper warehouse and Fraser's papers.

Every man with power was watching the same thing.

---

"Tell me about your army," I said.

One of the younger prisoners spat, small and angry. Abdul Karim shot him a glance that shut him up.

"Why should we tell you anything?" the younger man snapped in Malayalam. His accent was northern, rougher, not coastal.

Abdul Karim spoke without looking at him. "Because we are hungry," he said. "Because we are alive. Because talk is lighter than rope."

He looked back at me.

"Ask," he said.

So I did.

"Who trains you?" I asked.

Abdul Karim's eyes flicked sideways, as if checking whether any of his men would be shamed by the answer.

"Frenchmen," he said finally.

Hendrik had told me that word would come sooner or later. French officers drifted through Indian courts like smoke. They taught drill and demanded pay. They called it honour when it suited them and called it necessity when it did not.

I kept my face still.

"How?" I asked.

Abdul Karim leaned forward slightly, as if the question pleased him.

"They make us stand in lines until our legs stop being ours," he said. "They make us load and fire until our hands move without thought. They beat men for looking away. They beat men for breathing wrong. They beat men until discipline enters the bones."

He said it without complaint.

He said it like a man describing a forge.

"Volleys," he continued. "Not men firing when they feel brave. Whole ranks, together. One sound. One smoke. Then bayonet."

Bayonet again.

The younger prisoner looked away. Bayonets are close work. They leave no room for romance.

"We were told Indians cannot stand in line," Abdul Karim said, and for the first time I heard contempt in his voice. "We were told we would run when cannon fired."

He lifted his bound hands slightly.

"We stand," he said. "We do not run."

He looked at me as if daring me to deny it.

I did not.

---

"And the rockets?" I asked.

The shed seemed to tighten.

One of the prisoners, a thin man with burn scars on his forearm, swallowed hard. His eyes went distant, as if he could smell smoke that was not there.

Abdul Karim nodded toward him.

"He is a rocket man," he said. "Ask him."

I shifted my gaze to the thin man.

"Your name?" I asked.

"Sadiq," he murmured.

"How are they used?" I asked.

Sadiq licked his lips. "To break men," he said.

Abdul Karim watched him, face unreadable.

Sadiq continued, voice low.

"Rockets are not guns," he said. "Guns are straight. Rockets are angry."

He held up his scarred forearm.

"They scream," he said. "They make horses forget training. They make men look up."

He looked at me, and I saw something like pride fighting something like fear.

"We do not aim for one man," he said. "We aim for where men stand close. We aim for neatness."

Neatness.

The word landed in me like a stone.

"How many in a team?" I asked.

"Ten," Sadiq said. "Sometimes more. An officer. Men to carry. Men to light. Men to fetch new tubes."

There it was.

Doctrine.

Not a novelty.

A system.

"How far do they fly?" I asked.

Sadiq shrugged slightly. "Far enough," he said. "Sometimes they go where we want. Sometimes they go where God wants."

He paused.

"But even when they miss," he added, "they make men move."

That was the heart of it.

Mysore did not need accuracy to win.

It needed disruption.

---

I turned back to Abdul Karim.

"And your cavalry?" I asked.

Abdul Karim's mouth tightened in a way that looked almost like affection.

"Our cavalry is not for showing," he said. "Not for charging and dying like heroes."

He glanced toward the window slit, toward the yard where Travancore horsemen were untying their mounts.

"We wheel," he said. "We strike, we pull away, we strike again. We do not waste horses."

He said it as if wasting horses was a sin.

I thought of the old stories of Maratha charges, of glory measured in speed and blood. Abdul Karim spoke like a man who measured glory in survival.

Hyder's army, in his telling, was not a collection of brave men.

It was a machine.

---

When I had asked what I could, I sat back and let silence fill the shed.

Silence is useful.

Men talk to fill it.

Abdul Karim watched me, then spoke without being prompted.

"You are not Dutch," he said.

The statement landed in me like a slap.

"I was born Dutch," I replied.

He shook his head slightly. "Dutch men do not sit in this fort," he said. "Dutch men sit behind water and papers. They do not smell powder."

His gaze held mine.

"You are a gunner," he said. "That is your country now."

For a moment I could not breathe properly.

He had said it so simply, as if identity was a function, not a faith.

He glanced toward the door where the dead man lay outside.

"He died because we were slow," Abdul Karim said quietly. "Hyder Sahib will punish our officer for it."

"Punish?" I repeated.

Abdul Karim nodded. "A man who fails is removed," he said. "An army that is not feared is not an army."

I thought of Travancore, where failure could mean a whipping, or exile, or Marthanda Varma's temper in the old days. De Lannoy had built discipline here with fear too, but there were limits to it. Travancore still remembered that soldiers were men, not coins.

Mysore, in Abdul Karim's voice, sounded different.

It sounded hungry.

---

We returned the prisoners to a guarded room with water and rice.

Hendrik watched them go with a face that wanted violence.

"They speak too freely," he muttered in Dutch. "They should be made to fear."

De Lannoy, who had been listening from the doorway without making himself known, stepped forward.

"They already fear," he said. "Not you."

Hendrik stiffened.

De Lannoy's gaze moved to the yard, to the walls, to the distant trees beyond the ditch.

"They fear the man who trained them," he said. "That is why they are dangerous."

He looked at me.

"Write what you heard," he ordered. "Then burn nothing."

It was his way of saying, do not soothe yourself with belief.

That night I wrote until my hand cramped.

Infantry drill. Volley rhythm. Bayonet work.
Rocket teams. Ten men. Aim for neatness.
Cavalry wheel and strike.

I wrote it in Dutch, because Dutch was the language of my old Company's account books, and I could not stop myself from treating enemy doctrine like an inventory.

When I finished, I sat in the dark shed and listened to the fort settle into night.

In the distance, beyond the trees, the world was quiet.

Quiet is always temporary.

Abdul Karim's words stayed with me.

You are a gunner. That is your country now.

If that was true, then Mysore was about to invade my country.

# Chapter 16: The First Mysore War

War reaches you before the army does.

It arrives as rumours in a market. As a missing merchant. As a price that suddenly rises. As a letter carried by a man whose horse has foam on its flanks.

By the time the banners appear on the horizon, the war has already been living in your house for months.

The First Mysore War reached Travancore that way.

Not with cannon.

With paper.

---

In 1767, an English Company courier rode into Padmanabhapuram with dust in his hair and arrogance in his posture.

He brought letters sealed in red wax and spoke as if he were delivering gifts.

Hyder Ali had moved east, the courier said. He had threatened Company interests. The Company and its allies would respond. Allies were expected to cooperate.

Expected.

The word carried the shape of the future.

Raja Kesavadas received the courier with court politeness and dismissed him with promises that sounded like agreement and meant nothing of the sort.

But even in refusal, war leaves fingerprints.

Within weeks, English Company soldiers began to appear on roads near Travancore, marching north and west, their red coats flashing through green like warning flowers. Sepoys followed, brown faces under Company officers' commands, the sound of their boots and drums carrying through villages that had known only temple bells.

One afternoon an English Company detachment camped in a field two miles from Udayagiri, and Hendrik rode out to observe them.

He took me with him.

"You speak their tongue," he said, as if that explained everything.

It did not.

---

They had set up their camp with the neatness of men who believed neatness was a form of control.

Tents in rows. Cooking fires contained in shallow pits. Sentries posted at measured distances. A flagpole set up in the centre like a declaration.

Major Hawkins was there, his smile polished, his boots clean despite the mud.

"Captain De Lannoy's man," he greeted me, as if I belonged to De Lannoy the way a tool belongs to a hand. "Good to see you again, brother."

The word again.

I bowed and kept my face still.

Hawkins guided us toward the drill ground with the pride of a man showing off a machine.

"We will demonstrate for you," he said. "So you can see what proper infantry can do."

Proper.

He said it without malice.

That made it worse.

The sepoys formed ranks, muskets on shoulders, bayonets fixed. Their faces were set, disciplined, but I could see fear in the corners of their eyes. Fear is always present. Discipline is what you build around it.

The Company officers walked along the line, tapping muskets, adjusting a strap, correcting a stance.

Then a drum beat, and the whole formation moved.

They shifted from line into square with the clean efficiency of men who had practised until thought was no longer required. Four faces of muskets. Bayonets bristling outward. Officers in the centre. Colours held high.

I felt a cold appreciation in my chest.

Squares are ugly things. They are not meant for beauty. They are meant to stop cavalry. A wall of steel that can move.

Hawkins watched my face and smiled, pleased.

"You see," he said. "Cavalry cannot break that."

As if cavalry was the only thing a man needed to fear.

Hendrik watched too, eyes narrowed. He respected discipline even when it came wrapped in arrogance.

On Hawkins' signal, a group of Company horsemen trotted forward, not charging, only approaching, and the square held, muskets steady, bayonets outward.

The horses did not like it. Horses understand steel. They snorted and shifted, ears flicking, refusing to press their bodies into a hedge of points.

The demonstration ended with laughter and applause from the Company officers.

Hawkins turned to me.

"Tell your king," he said, "that the Company is strong. We will handle Mysore."

I translated his words into Malayalam for Hendrik, and I watched Hendrik's expression tighten.

Strong.

Handle.

The verbs were too certain.

On the ride back to Udayagiri, Hendrik spoke little.

When he did speak, it was in Dutch, as if he wanted the language to make the thought more precise.

"A square is impressive," he admitted.

I nodded. "It is," I replied.

Hendrik glanced at me. "But?"

I thought of Sadiq's words.

Aim for neatness.

"A square is also a target," I said.

Hendrik frowned. He did not like answers that were not neat.

---

The news from the north came in fragments.

A merchant who had seen smoke rising beyond Coimbatore.
A refugee family with burns on their backs and no possessions left to steal.
A Travancore patrol captain with a dented helmet and a new scar across his cheek.

Then came the first report that mattered, carried by a sepoy whose left arm was wrapped in cloth soaked through with blood.

He had been sent to Udayagiri because the fort had a healer, and because De Lannoy's name still carried weight among the Company's men. They trusted his competence even when they did not trust his loyalty.

The sepoy sat in our shed, jaw clenched, sweat on his lip despite the cool water Lakshmi had insisted I bring for him.

His English was broken, but his Malayalam was fluent, the Malayalam of a man from the coast who had learned Company commands the way he learned any other foreign curse.

"They formed square," he said, and the way he said it made square sound like prayer. "Perfect square. Officers shouting. Drums beating."

I leaned forward. "Where?" I asked.

He shook his head. Place names were less important than images. "On flat ground," he said. "Dry ground. Like a training field."

I could see it.

The sepoy swallowed and continued.

"Cavalry came," he said. "Hyder's horse, many. They tried to break. They could not. We fired. They fell. The horses did not like the bayonet. They turned."

He paused, and his hand trembled slightly against his bandage.

I watched the tremor the way I watched a gun carriage bolt loosen.

It meant something was about to fail.

"Then," he said, and his voice dropped, "the rockets came."

The shed felt colder.

"How many?" I asked.

He stared at me as if I was foolish. "Enough," he said.

He forced himself to keep speaking.

"They screamed," he said. "They came low. They came high. They came in the smoke. One hit the ground outside the square and burst, and iron flew into the legs of men. Another came over the corner and hit inside."

Inside.

That was the key.

"A square cannot open," he said, voice tight. "A square is closed. Men are close. Officers are inside. Drums are inside."

He swallowed hard.

"When it burst inside," he said, "it was like fire entering a hut."

I could see it too clearly.

Men packed shoulder to shoulder. Smoke trapped. Rockets exploding. Iron fragments ricocheting off bayonets and bones.

"The horses came again," the sepoy said. "Not to break the bayonet. Only to push. To press men while rockets fell."

His eyes lifted to mine, and in them I saw shame and fury.

"Men ran," he whispered. "Not because they were cowards. Because their bodies moved."

He clenched his jaw.

"The square broke," he said. "And when a square breaks, everything breaks."

I sat back slowly.

Hendrik, who had been listening in silence, spoke in a controlled voice.

"And the officers?" he asked.

The sepoy's expression went flat. "Some died," he said. "Some rode away. The rest of us carried the wounded until our arms shook."

He looked down at his bandage.

"This," he added, "is a rocket."

---

That night I could not sleep.

I lay beside Lakshmi and listened to the insects outside our shutters, the steady song of a world that did not care about rockets or squares.

Lakshmi's hand rested on my chest, warm and heavy, as if anchoring me to something human.

My mind refused anchoring.

It kept returning to the image of the square.

A thing built out of discipline.

A thing that works.

A thing that becomes a grave when rockets fall.

Near midnight I rose and went to the shed.

The fort was quiet. A sentry's footstep scraped stone. Somewhere a dog barked once and then stopped.

In the shed I spread my range tables and my rough sketches of rocket fragments.

I began to write new instructions.

No tight ranks without cover.
Traverses to break blast.
Loopholes spaced wider.
Gunners trained to aim for the flash of a launch, not the rocket's flight.

Hendrik found me there before dawn, his face grey with fatigue.

He read my notes without speaking.

When he finished, he looked at me.

"This is not how the Company fights," he said.

"The Company is not fighting our war," I replied.

Hendrik's jaw tightened.

"My father built this fort on European doctrine," he said.

"He built it on what worked," I said. "He changed doctrine when it stopped working. That is why he is still alive."

Hendrik stared at the paper as if he wanted to argue with it.

Then, slowly, he nodded.

"We drill," he said.

In the yard, as the sun rose, we drilled.

Not squares.

Not neatness.

Movement. Cover. Discipline that could bend without breaking.

Caspar watched for a while, leaning against the wall, his burned hands wrapped in cloth.

"So," he said, voice dry, "we are learning to run properly now."

Hendrik shot him a look. Caspar grinned.

I did not laugh.

I had seen what rockets did to men who could not run.

The First Mysore War did not send Hyder's banners to our walls.

But it sent us the shape of the war to come.

And in that shape I could already see the outline of our future.

Rockets screaming.
Walls measured by Company men.
Pepper sacks turning into powder.

The jungle changing.

# Chapter 17: The Old Man's Burden

Old men do not collapse.

They fray.

The first thread is small. A hand that takes longer to close around a sword hilt. A breath that comes a little shorter after a flight of steps. A knee that aches before rain as if it has learned to predict weather.

Then the threads multiply.

And one day you look at the man who taught you how to live, and you realise he is becoming a map of his own battles.

By 1770, De Lannoy was approaching sixty.

He was still sharp.

It was his body that had begun to betray him.

---

He hid it well.

He had built his life on control, and pain is a kind of rebellion. He treated it the way he treated disobedience in the gun yard. With contempt and discipline.

On the wall, he still walked as if the stone belonged to him. His limp was controlled, measured, almost elegant. If you did not know him, you might have thought it was a habit, a manner of movement.

If you did know him, you saw the small pauses when he thought no one was watching.

The way his hand would rest on the parapet for a heartbeat before he continued.

The way his breath would catch when he turned too quickly.

The way he stopped climbing the stair to the highest battery unless he had to.

He was losing ground one step at a time.

---

That year the monsoon came early, heavy and persistent, and the fort smelled of damp stone and rust.

We had spent the dry months repairing gun carriages, replacing rotten spokes, tightening bolts. We had built small covered positions along the wall line, crude shelters meant to protect gunners from rocket fragments. Hendrik called them ugly. Caspar called them coffins.

De Lannoy approved them without comment.

On a morning when the rain paused long enough for the yard to fill with pale light, De Lannoy came down to inspect the new cover works.

He moved slowly, but his eyes missed nothing.

He stopped at the first shelter and ran his fingers along the wood.

"Too thin," he said in Malayalam.

Hendrik stiffened. "It will stop splinters," he replied.

"It will stop splinters," De Lannoy agreed. "It will not stop iron."

He looked at me.

"What thickness?" he asked in Dutch.

The question was not really for me. It was for Hendrik. De Lannoy used me sometimes like a mirror, showing his son how he wanted him to think.

I answered anyway.

"As thick as we can manage," I said. "And angled. Not flat. Flat catches."

De Lannoy nodded.

He turned to Hendrik.

"Angle it," he ordered.

Hendrik's jaw tightened, but he nodded.

Discipline has many faces. Sometimes it is obedience. Sometimes it is swallowing pride.

Caspar watched from the edge of the yard with his arms folded, his burned hands still marked, the skin on his palms slightly darker where it had healed. He looked at his father with an expression that was hard to read.

Not contempt.

Not pity.

Something closer to fear.

---

When the inspection ended, De Lannoy walked back toward the shed and his leg gave a small sudden tremor.

It was nothing. A twitch. The kind of movement most men would ignore.

But De Lannoy's face tightened, and he stopped.

He stood still, hand on the shed post, breathing carefully through his nose.

The yard's noise continued around him as if nothing had happened.

Men laughed at a joke.
A mule shook rain from its flank.
A gunner shouted at a boy to fetch oil.

De Lannoy waited until the tremor passed, then straightened.

Only then did he look at me.

"Inside," he said in Dutch.

I followed him into the shed and closed the door behind us.

The shed's familiar smells wrapped around me. Chalk dust. Old leather. Powder residue ground into wood.

De Lannoy sat heavily on the low stool by the table.

For a moment he did not speak.

His breath came shallow. Sweat shone at his temple.

I had never seen him sit like that.

Not defeated, but forced.

As if his body had issued an order he could not refuse.

"Pain?" I asked, because the word felt safer than silence.

De Lannoy gave a small humourless laugh.

"Old age," he said. "Pain is what old age uses to speak."

He took a cup of water and drank, slow.

Then he looked at me, and in his eyes there was an openness I had not seen before.

It was the look of a man who has run out of time for performance.

"I have been careful with you," he said.

The sentence startled me more than it should have.

Careful.

De Lannoy was not a man who used that word about people.

"Why?" I asked.

He set the cup down.

"Because you were a boy with hate in your mouth," he said. "And hate is useful. Until it is not."

He paused.

"Because I did not want you to love me," he continued. "Love makes men stupid."

He glanced toward the wall, invisible through the shed.

"A fort needs men who are not stupid," he said.

I wanted to argue. I wanted to say love can also make men stand. Love can make them hold a wall when fear tells them to run.

But I understood what he meant.

He had not built this army on affection.

He had built it on work.

Work survives feelings.

---

He spoke more that day than he usually did.

Not in long speeches. De Lannoy never wasted words.

In short statements that landed like shot.

"The Company will keep smiling."

"Hyder will keep learning."

"Your king is good, but goodness does not stop rockets."

He tapped the table with one finger.

"When I die," he said, and he said it as if he were talking about a bolt that would eventually snap, "Hendrik will have the command. He will want to be my shadow. Shadows do not hold walls."

I stared at him.

De Lannoy looked toward the door as if he could see his sons through it.

"Caspar will want to be fire," he continued. "Fire burns what it touches, including itself."

He looked back at me.

"And you," he said quietly, "will be between them."

Margaret had said the same words to me years before.

Between them.

The repetition made my chest feel tight, as if fate had found a phrase and would not let go.

"Why are you telling me this?" I asked.

De Lannoy's mouth tightened.

"Because I cannot tell them," he said. "Hendrik hears orders, not fear. Caspar hears danger, not advice."

He paused, then added, softer, "And Margaret is tired of being the only one who speaks to both."

The mention of his wife did something to his face.

Not softness.

Weariness.

The weariness of a man who had spent a lifetime being strong in public and wanted, briefly, to be weak somewhere private.

But weakness was not permitted to him.

Not even now.

---

When I left the shed, the rain had started again.

It fell in thick sheets, drumming on the fort's roofs, turning the yard into slick mud.

De Lannoy stayed inside.

He did not come out for evening drill.

Hendrik took command without comment, his voice snapping across the yard, the gunners moving by habit.

Caspar watched from under an eave, cup in hand, his eyes on the shed door as if he expected his father to emerge and prove the body wrong.

He did not.

That night, at home, Lakshmi watched me quietly while I ate.

She could always tell when something had shifted in me.

"He is getting older," she said finally, watching my face.

"Yes," I admitted.

Lakshmi nodded, as if she had already counted the years and reached the same conclusion.

"Then you must become older too," she said.

Her voice was not unkind.

It was practical.

That was her gift.

She did not comfort me with lies.

She reminded me of duties.

I lay awake that night listening to the rain and thinking of De Lannoy's hand on the shed post, the small tremor in his leg, the moment he could not pretend.

I had been remade by him.

Now the man who remade me was fraying.

And I could already feel the fort's weight shifting toward my shoulders.

# Chapter 18: The Chapel

The chapel at Udayagiri was smaller than a powder magazine and more dangerous in its own way.

Powder can kill you quickly.

Faith can kill you slowly, by teaching you who to hate and then making you proud of it.

De Lannoy built that chapel with his own money after Kalakad.

His son Joannes had been killed there on the fourteenth of September, 1765, a young officer not yet hardened enough to believe he could die. The men of the fort called the boy *Cheriya Kappittan*, the Small Captain. De Lannoy never used the nickname. He only said his son's name once, as if saying it twice might summon the same messenger again.

When I was a boy in Batavia, my mother taught me to bow my head in a Lutheran church and keep it up everywhere else. She taught me to distrust Catholics the way you distrust stagnant water.

"They smile," she used to say. "And then they take."

I learned those lessons early.

I carried them to Ceylon.

I carried them to Colachel.

I carried them into Travancore, and I did not understand at first that a man can live in a Hindu king's service and still carry old European hatreds like a relic in his pocket.

---

De Lannoy went to the chapel on Sundays when his joints allowed it.

He did not announce it. He did not make a show. He simply left the fort yard after morning drill and walked toward the small stone building near the outer wall, where a wooden cross rose above the roofline like a spear.

His wife Margaret went too, of course, her shawl pulled over her hair, a rosary hidden in her palm.

Sometimes Hendrik went, dutiful, as if faith was another kind of discipline.

Caspar rarely went. He said God was too polite in chapels. He preferred gods who lived in storms.

That morning, after De Lannoy's leg had trembled again and he had retreated to the shed, Margaret came to my house.

Lakshmi answered the door, eyes calm.

Margaret greeted her with the careful warmth of a woman who has learned to navigate other women's worlds. Lakshmi replied with equal care. They had never been friends. They had never been enemies. They shared one thing, and it was enough.

Men who belonged to no one else.

"Pieter," Margaret said, and her Portuguese accent softened my name the way the air softens stone, "will you come with him today?"

I hesitated.

Lakshmi's gaze held on me, unreadable.

Margaret's face stayed composed, but there was something in her eyes that made refusal feel like cruelty.

"He will listen to you," she added quietly. "Sometimes he listens to you when he will not listen to me."

That was not true.

It was simply the way Margaret asked for help without sounding like she needed it.

I nodded.

---

The chapel smelled of wax and damp stone.

Candles burned in front of a small painted image of Mary, her face pale and gentle, her eyes lowered as if she did not want to see what men had done in her name. A wooden crucifix hung above the altar. The carved Christ looked thinner than any man who had ever carried a musket.

The priest was Portuguese, old, his hair grey and his hands stained with ink. He spoke in a mixture of Portuguese and Malayalam, because language here was always a negotiation.

The congregation was small.

A few Parava fishermen.
Two soldiers who crossed themselves quickly, as if embarrassed.
Margaret and her children.
De Lannoy, standing stiffly near the front, his face expressionless.

And me, at the back, feeling like an intruder in a room that was supposed to be mine by birth.

As the priest began the prayers, I watched De Lannoy.

He moved with practised familiarity. He knelt slowly, careful of his knee. He made the sign of the cross without flourish. His lips moved in words I had been taught to mistrust.

There was no performance in him.

Only habit.

Habit is a kind of truth.

The priest spoke of loyalty. Of suffering. Of kings and taxes and the temptation to believe that God lived in the house of the powerful.

He did not speak of Marthanda Varma.

He did not speak of Hyder Ali.

He spoke as if the chapel existed outside history.

I knew better.

In a kingdom like this, even a prayer is political.

---

After the mass, Margaret went to speak with the priest. Hendrik stepped outside and stood in the sunlight as if needing to prove he was not trapped by stone walls and incense.

De Lannoy stayed kneeling.

The candles flickered in the humid air. A lizard moved along the wall, quick and silent.

I waited.

When De Lannoy finally rose, he did it slowly, hand braced on the pew. His breath caught for a moment and then steadied.

He turned and saw me.

His eyebrows rose slightly.

"You came," he said in Dutch, as if confirming it for himself.

"Margaret asked," I replied.

De Lannoy glanced toward his wife, then back at me.

"She worries too much," he said.

He stepped outside into the light and paused, letting the sun warm his face. The fort wall rose beyond the chapel, stone and iron, the kingdom's real prayer.

We stood in silence for a while.

Then, because silence in a chapel courtyard feels like something you must fill, I spoke.

"You never converted," I said.

The words sounded blunt, almost rude.

De Lannoy's gaze stayed on the wall.

"No," he said simply.

"Some men expected you to," I continued. "The Dutch. The Brahmins. Even the Company men."

De Lannoy's mouth tightened.

"They expect many things," he said.

I swallowed and forced myself to ask what I had been circling for years.

"Why did you not?" I asked. "Why stay Catholic when no one wants you as Catholic?"

De Lannoy looked at me then, and there was a flicker of something in his eyes.

Amusement, perhaps.

Or pity.

"Because it is true," he said.

The answer was so simple it made my chest tighten.

"True?" I repeated.

De Lannoy nodded.

"I was raised Catholic," he said. "I prayed as a boy. I sinned as a man. I will die as a Catholic. Changing the words does not change the work."

He gestured toward the fort.

"I serve a Hindu king," he continued. "That is my work. It does not require me to pretend his god is mine."

He looked back toward the chapel door where Margaret stood, still speaking with the priest.

"My wife would not have married a man who lied about his faith," he added quietly. "And I did not build this life by lying."

The last sentence surprised me more than it should have.

De Lannoy had lied, of course. Every soldier lies. He had lied to the Dutch when it suited him. He had lied to enemies. He had lied with silence.

But perhaps he meant a different kind of lie.

The lie that turns a man into a mask.

---

I thought of myself then.

Lutheran by birth.

Husband to a Hindu woman.

Father to children with Christian names who bowed to temple lamps because it pleased their mother and because the world was safer when you respected the gods of the land you lived on.

I had not prayed in a Lutheran church in years. When I did pray, it was not Lutheran or Catholic or Hindu. It was the wordless prayer of a man measuring powder by lamplight and hoping his hands would not slip.

Where did that leave me?

"What is belonging?" I asked him before I could stop myself.

De Lannoy looked at me with the tired patience he reserved for questions that had no clean answer.

"Belonging is work done well," he said.

I frowned. "Only work?"

He shook his head slightly.

"Work is what remains when everything else changes," he said. "Faith can change. Names can change. Kings die. Companies rot."

He tapped the stone wall with his knuckles.

"But a fort still needs men who will stand on it," he said.

He paused, and his voice softened by a fraction.

"And it needs someone to bury you when you fall," he added. "That is belonging too."

I looked at him, and for a moment I saw not the foreign captain but the man who had been swallowed by this land and decided, stubbornly, to stay in its stomach.

"Will they bury you as a Catholic?" I asked.

De Lannoy's mouth tightened.

"The Dutch will not," he said. "The Brahmins will not. The Portuguese priest will, because Margaret will make him. The king will allow it, because the king understands debts."

He looked toward the fort again.

"And the soil will not care," he finished.

That was the most honest thing he had said all morning.

---

On the walk back to the fort, Margaret fell into step beside me.

Her rosary clicked softly in her hand.

"Thank you," she said.

I shook my head. "I did nothing," I replied.

Margaret gave a small tired smile.

"You stood near him," she said. "That is not nothing."

Ahead of us, De Lannoy walked slowly, his limp controlled, his shoulders still straight.

Hendrik walked on his other side, guarding him with duty.

Caspar was not there. Caspar never came when the room was quiet and full of God.

At the fort gate, a sentry saluted, eyes flicking to De Lannoy, then away. Respect. Fear. Habit.

De Lannoy stepped through the gate and the yard noise swallowed him again.

Guns being cleaned.
Men shouting.
Wheels creaking.

Work.

As I watched him disappear into his own creation, I realised something that unsettled me.

For years I had thought belonging was a place you could arrive at.

Perhaps it was only a set of duties you could not escape.

# Chapter 19: The Dutch Shadow

I had not heard Dutch spoken in anger for years.

Dutch in Travancore was a dead language. It lived only in De Lannoy's mouth when he wanted to cut through hesitation, and in my own when I wanted to think without being overheard.

When you stop hearing a language every day, it becomes a ghost. It returns in dreams. It turns familiar words into echoes.

The day the Dutch ship anchored off the coast, the ghost returned with a flag.

---

We saw it first from the fort wall, a pale shape on the sea, its sails catching light like bone.

Hendrik brought a telescope to the parapet and stared until his eyes watered. Caspar climbed up beside him and squinted at the horizon with theatrical impatience.

"Is it English?" Caspar asked.

"No," Hendrik replied, voice flat. "Dutch."

The word landed on my skin like cold rain.

I took the telescope and looked.

The ship was not large. A trading vessel, not a warship. The sea had bleached its wood. The sails carried a mark, faded but unmistakable.

The VOC monogram.

For a moment my chest tightened so hard I thought I might choke.

Batavia rose in my mind like a smell.

Spice warehouses.
Dock ropes.
My mother's voice.

Then the image shifted, because the VOC had never been only a home. It had also been a machine that chewed men up and called it service.

The ship anchored and waited.

It did not sail away.

---

The court sent a messenger to Udayagiri by evening.

The Dutch factor at the coast requested audience.

Requested.

Even that small word told me something had changed.

In Marthanda Varma's day, the Dutch did not request. They negotiated with cannon.

Now they were sending letters.

De Lannoy read the note and handed it to me.

"You will go," he said in Dutch.

I looked at him.

De Lannoy's eyes held mine.

"You will listen," he added. "You will not argue. You will come back and tell me what kind of Dutch they are now."

His voice carried contempt under the calm.

I understood it.

The Dutch De Lannoy had betrayed were not the Dutch who were coming now.

Those men had been confident.

These men were coming with hats in hand.

---

I rode to the coast with two Travancore guards and a clerk from Kesavadas' office.

The road smelled of wet earth and pepper vines. Fishermen hauled nets in the backwater channels, their bodies slick with sweat and river water. Women squatted by the bank washing cloth, the rhythm of their hands steady and indifferent to European flags.

The world did not care that my old Company had arrived.

At the small coastal landing, the Dutch factor waited under a cloth awning.

He was not young. His hair was thin and powdered. His coat was worn at the cuffs. His boots had been repaired too many times.

He bowed deeply when the Travancore clerk approached.

I watched and felt something inside me shift.

This was not the Dutch of my childhood.

This was a Dutchman who had learned to survive.

The factor's gaze slid to me, and for a moment his face changed.

Recognition.

Then calculation.

"Pieter van der Berg," he said in Dutch, and the sound of my name in his mouth made my throat tighten. "They told me you were here. I did not believe it."

His accent was Amsterdam, clipped and dry. It was not the Batavia Dutch of my mother. It was the Netherlands itself, carried across oceans.

I bowed slightly.

"I am here," I replied.

The factor's eyes moved over my coat, my posture, the way the Travancore guards stood behind me as if I belonged to them.

"So you are," he said softly.

He turned back to the clerk and spoke in Portuguese, polite and careful. He requested permission to trade. He spoke of friendship. He spoke of old agreements.

I translated into Malayalam for the clerk, and as I spoke I watched the factor's hands.

He held them still, but the fingers kept making small movements, as if counting invisible coins.

When the clerk replied, his tone was controlled. Travancore would consider. Travancore had its own agreements. Travancore's king did not forget Colachel.

I translated into Dutch.

The factor's mouth tightened, but he nodded.

"Of course," he said. "Of course. We understand."

Understand.

Another word that meant, we will keep trying.

---

When the formalities ended, the factor asked quietly, in Dutch, "Will you walk with me?"

The Travancore guards shifted. The clerk glanced at me.

I nodded.

We walked along the sand toward the waterline where the ship's longboat waited. The sea air was sharp and clean compared to the fort's powder smell.

The factor spoke without looking at me, as if he was speaking to the sea.

"The Dutch Company is not what it was," he said.

I almost laughed. "It was never what it pretended to be," I replied.

The factor's mouth twitched.

"True," he admitted. "But now it does not even pretend well."

He paused, then added, lower, "Batavia is sick."

The words hit me harder than I expected.

Batavia had been the centre of my world, even when I hated it.

"Sick how?" I asked.

The factor shrugged slightly. "Debt," he said. "Corruption. Wars. Men who steal from the Company and call it profit."

He glanced at me finally.

"The English are different," he said.

There it was.

The sentence I had been waiting for without knowing it.

"How?" I asked.

The factor's gaze went toward the horizon, toward nothing.

"The Dutch trade," he said. "We build factories. We negotiate monopolies. We take, yes, but we do it through paper and ports."

He looked back at the land.

"The English take land," he said. "They take it with treaties at first, then with soldiers, and then they act as if it was always theirs."

I thought of Hawkins and Fraser, their smiles, their words.

Brother.
Assurances.
Arrangements.

The factor's voice stayed calm, but I heard something in it that sounded like fear.

"They do not want pepper only," he continued. "They want the hand that weighs the pepper. They want the road that carries it. They want the village that grows it."

He exhaled slowly.

"They want kings to become clerks," he said.

The phrase made my stomach twist.

Kesavadas had said the same thing in different words.

Fight with paper.

"Then why are you here?" I asked.

The factor's lips pressed together.

"Because we are hungry," he said.

It was the most honest answer he had given.

He reached into his coat and pulled out a folded letter, the paper creased and stained with travel.

"This is for you," he said, and held it out.

My fingers hesitated before taking it.

The letter was sealed with wax, but the seal was broken. The factor had opened it.

He read my hesitation and shrugged.

"I had to know what I was carrying," he said. "In these days, paper is more dangerous than powder."

I stared at the letter.

"From whom?" I asked.

The factor's gaze flicked down and then up again.

"From a chaplain in Cochin," he said. "He writes to the Company about you sometimes. About De Lannoy too. He says there are Dutch men in Travancore who have become something else."

Something else.

That phrase again, from Lakshmi, from my own thoughts, from everyone who could not name what I was.

I turned the letter over in my hands.

The paper felt thin, fragile.

It felt like a bridge that could snap.

"What does it say?" I asked.

The factor smiled faintly. "Read it," he replied. "It will sound like judgement and pity. Priests always think those are useful."

---

I did not open the letter on the beach.

I carried it back to Udayagiri as if it were a live ember.

In the fort shed that night, I broke the seal properly and unfolded the paper.

The chaplain wrote in careful Dutch.

He wrote that the Company had not forgotten Colachel.
He wrote that De Lannoy was a traitor in the eyes of Europe.
He wrote that my name appeared in records as a captured boy presumed dead.
He wrote that rumours said I had married a heathen and raised children outside the church.

He wrote that God forgives the repentant.

He wrote that if I wished to return to the fold, there were ways.

Ways.

Always ways, always arrangements.

He wrote that the English were rising and the Dutch were declining, and that a man should place his soul with a church that would survive.

That last line made me laugh out loud, once, sharp.

As if churches were fortifications.

As if survival was the same as truth.

I folded the letter and set it down.

De Lannoy, who had come into the shed without me hearing, stood in the doorway watching me.

"Well?" he asked in Dutch.

I held up the letter.

"They want me back," I said.

De Lannoy's mouth tightened.

"They do not want you," he replied. "They want the idea that you did not escape them."

He stepped into the shed slowly.

"The Dutch shadow is shrinking," he said. "It will keep shrinking until it is only a story men tell themselves to sleep."

He looked at the letter, then away.

"The English shadow is growing," he continued. "And it will not be satisfied with stories."

His gaze moved to me.

"You have a house," he said. "You have children. That is where you stand."

It was the closest he came to telling me what to feel.

I nodded.

Outside, the fort settled into night, the guns silent, the walls dark.

Beyond them, somewhere on the sea, the Dutch ship waited for an answer that would not save it.

The next morning, it sailed away.

Its sail mark faded into the horizon until it was nothing but a pale line against the water.

I watched until my eyes ached.

Then I turned back to the wall, because the wall was real.

The Dutch were becoming ghosts.

The English were becoming a future.

# Chapter 20: The Wall Takes Shape

A wall is not stone.

Stone is what men see when they want to be comforted.

A wall is labour. It is mud dug by hands that blister. It is timber cut in rain. It is rice brought on time so the men digging do not walk away. It is officers who stay sober long enough to count. It is an argument between engineers about where a bastion should sit. It is a decision about which village will lose its trees so another village can keep its roof.

I learned that when the *Nedumkotta* began to take shape.

The Travancore Lines.

A line cut across the land like a scar.

---

The first time I rode north to see the work, it was still only a path through jungle.

Men had cleared brush and marked the intended line with stakes. A ditch had been started in one place, a shallow wound in the earth, and in another place a mound of soil had been piled and tamped by feet, an earthen lip that looked laughably small against the green world around it.

This, I thought, is what kingdoms trust.

Then I watched the labourers work.

They moved with the steady rhythm of people who have never been allowed the luxury of believing effort is optional. Men dug with spades and baskets. Women carried earth in loads balanced on cloth rings on their heads. Children brought water and ran messages.

Soldiers stood with spears, not because they expected the labourers to rebel, but because a wall needs protection even while it is being born.

The air smelled of wet leaves and sweat. Insects whined at the edges of hearing. Every few minutes someone slapped at a leech.

The work was slow.

It was also relentless.

That relentlessness was the true wall.

---

Raja Kesavadas met me at a temporary camp, a cluster of palm-leaf shelters and canvas tents raised on slightly higher ground to avoid the worst of the water.

He looked out over the cleared line with a face made for columns. Calm. Assessing. Unimpressed by romance.

"De Lannoy cannot ride this far now," he said by way of greeting.

It was not criticism. It was a fact with weight.

"He sent me," I replied.

Kesavadas nodded.

"Good," he said. "Then you will show me where the guns should stand."

There it was.

The truth of why I had been brought.

Men could dig walls.

Few men could see a wall as a platform for fire.

We walked the line together with an escort of soldiers and two local engineers, thin men with calm eyes who carried measuring cords and bamboo poles marked with notches.

One engineer pointed to a low rise and spoke in Malayalam.

"A bastion here," he said. "High ground."

I looked at the rise and then looked beyond it.

High ground is useful, but it is also a promise you must pay for. A bastion on high ground can see far. It can also be seen far.

I crouched and scraped away leaf litter with my hand until the soil showed.

The ground was soft.

Too soft for heavy guns unless it was reinforced.

"It will sink in monsoon," I said.

The engineer frowned, offended by the idea that the earth could betray him.

Kesavadas watched me.

"Then where?" he asked.

I stood and walked ten paces to the left, where the land dipped slightly and the soil felt firmer underfoot.

Here the wall would not be a proud line on a hill.

It would be a hidden line that could still kill.

"Here," I said. "And the bastion should cover that curve."

I pointed to a bend in the intended ditch line where attackers might try to cluster out of direct fire.

Dead ground.

The place a wall cannot see unless you shape it properly.

One engineer argued, polite but stubborn. A bastion on a dip looked weak. A bastion should dominate.

I listened, then drew a quick sketch in the dirt with a stick.

I drew the wall line.
I drew the ditch.
I drew two bastions, each angled to cover the other's face.

Then I drew the arcs of fire.

Not pretty arcs.

Cold arcs, like compass strokes.

The engineer stared, and his mouth tightened as he understood.

If you place the bastion on the rise, you leave dead ground in the bend.
If you place it lower and angle it, you sweep the bend with enfilade fire.

Enfilade is the ugliest kind of killing. It turns a line of men into a corridor of flesh.

It is also how walls survive.

Kesavadas nodded.

"Do that," he said.

The engineers bowed, accepting the decision.

There were no hurt feelings. Hurt feelings do not matter when a kingdom is trying not to die.

---

For weeks after that, I returned to the Lines whenever the fort allowed it.

I walked the ditch line and felt the slope with my feet.

I stood in the cleared corridors and imagined men running toward me with ladders and hooks.

I imagined horses refusing to cross the ditch and then being whipped until they did.

I imagined rockets arcing overhead, screaming into the night.

Then I placed imaginary guns and imagined what those guns could see.

This was the work De Lannoy had trained my mind for.

A wall is a drawing.

A gun is a sentence.

A field of fire is an argument that cannot be negotiated.

I marked positions for batteries where the wall met thicker ground.

I argued for traverses and covered magazines, because I had seen what one spark could do in a confined space.

I pushed for overlapping arcs, because a solitary bastion is a lonely death.

Every bastion placed to cover its neighbour.
Every gun sited to sweep an approach.
Every gap treated as a future disaster.

The engineers began to look at the land the way I did.

Not as beauty.

As angles.

In the evenings, when the labourers sat by their fires and ate rice and fish, I would sit with the engineers and draw.

They would point and argue.

I would correct and explain.

We were speaking the same language without sharing a faith or a birth.

The language of survival.

---

When my sketches grew into proper plans, I carried them back to Udayagiri for De Lannoy.

He was in the shed when I arrived, seated, his leg stretched out awkwardly, a cloth wrapped around his knee. Margaret was there too, silent in the corner, her face calm and tired.

De Lannoy looked up as I spread the plans on the table.

Hendrik hovered behind him, ready to take control.

Caspar leaned against the doorway, pretending indifference.

I pointed to the line.

"Here," I said in Dutch, "the ditch should deepen. The soil is softer. Attackers will try to fill it."

De Lannoy nodded.

"Here," I continued, "a bastion must be angled to sweep the bend. Otherwise you leave dead ground."

De Lannoy's eyes followed my finger.

His gaze was still sharp. The mind had not frayed the way the body had.

I spoke of traverses and magazines.

I spoke of interlocking fire.

I spoke of the way rockets would behave in open ground, where they would land, how a wall could force their crews into exposed positions.

When I finished, the shed was quiet.

Hendrik's eyes stayed on the plans, his face controlled. He saw the logic. He also saw that the logic had not come from him.

Caspar's gaze moved from the plans to me and back again, restless. He wanted war, not drawings of it.

Margaret watched her husband.

De Lannoy sat very still.

Then he nodded, once, small and decisive.

"You have learned to see what is not yet there," he said.

The words were simple.

They landed in me like a weight.

Because they were praise, and De Lannoy did not praise.

He reached for the crop that lay beside his slate and tapped the plan near the northern bend.

"Make this bastion thicker," he said. "Not for pride. For rockets."

I nodded.

De Lannoy looked at Hendrik then.

"You will oversee the work," he ordered.

Hendrik straightened. "Yes, Father."

De Lannoy's gaze moved to Caspar.

"And you will stay sober at the Lines," he said.

Caspar laughed once, sharp. "I will try," he replied.

De Lannoy did not laugh back.

"Do not try," he said. "Do."

Caspar's smile faltered for a fraction.

Then he nodded, an acknowledgement that carried more weight than obedience.

De Lannoy leaned back slightly and closed his eyes for a moment, as if the effort of decision had cost him.

When he opened them again, he looked older.

The Lines were taking shape.

The wall was becoming real.

And the man who had taught us to build was slowly leaving the work to others.

# Chapter 21: Night on the Lines

Monsoon work is a lesson in humiliation.

In the dry season, men build walls like they are writing their names into the earth. They stand tall. They shout. They talk about endurance and pride.

In the rains, the land reminds you that it does not care about pride.

Mud sucks at your feet and steals your boots.
Lantern light turns every raindrop into a flashing blade.
Powder clumps if you breathe on it wrong.
Rope goes slick.
Wood swells and warps.

And still the wall must be built.

---

I spent three nights that month at the Lines, sleeping under canvas that leaked, waking to the sound of men cursing softly as they dug.

The ditch had deepened. The earthen rampart had grown taller. Stakes had been driven into the ground at angles meant to break a charge and slow a ladder. Covered magazines were being built, small and precious, because I would not allow powder to sit in open air after what fire had almost done to us.

The gunners hated it.

They hated carrying barrels under tarpaulins. They hated guarding magazines instead of firing guns. They hated the way I insisted on slow careful handling even when rain made everything slippery.

They did it anyway.

Discipline is not love.

It is habit learned in fear.

On the third night, the habit was tested.

---

The attack began with silence.

Not a dramatic silence.

The ordinary silence of rain swallowing sound.

Men dug. Lanterns swung. A sentry walked the half-finished parapet, his spear tip glinting when lightning flickered behind clouds.

I was in a small covered gun position on a newly raised bastion, two six-pounders set behind a rough earthwork, their barrels oiled and covered when not in use.

Hendrik had wanted heavier guns on the line, but the ground was still settling. A heavy cannon on wet earth is a promise to sink.

Six-pounders were light enough to be moved.

Light enough to be fired quickly.

That night, speed mattered more than weight.

The gun crew with me was young. Their faces shone with rain and sweat. One boy held the slow match under a leather cover to keep it from hissing out.

I listened to the rain and tried to imagine what the jungle looked like beyond the ditch.

You cannot see far in monsoon night.

You see only what comes close enough to kill you.

Then a lantern in the ditch line flickered and went out.

A second later, a sentry's shout cut through the rain.

"Men!"

The shout turned into a gurgle.

Then came the sound of bodies struggling in mud.

And then a torch flared in the dark, sudden and bright.

It moved fast, low to the ground.

Not a labourer's torch.

A raider's.

---

The men came out of the rain like a swarm.

Not hundreds. Not an army.

Scouts.

Thirty, maybe forty, moving in a loose rush, their cloth dark, their faces indistinct. They carried swords and matchlocks, and a few carried bundles on their backs that could have been tools or could have been rockets.

They aimed for the unfinished section where the ditch was shallower and the palisade was still being raised.

They knew the line.

They had been watching.

My mouth went dry.

I shouted in Malayalam.

"To the guns. Now."

The boy with the slow match fumbled and nearly dropped it. I grabbed his wrist hard enough to steady him.

"Hold it," I hissed. "Like you want to live."

The crew moved, suddenly awake.

Sponge.
Load.
Ram.

Their hands were slick. The rammer nearly slipped. I forced myself not to shout. Shouting does not dry hands.

Outside, men were screaming in the ditch, and in those screams I heard the sound that matters most in a fight.

Panic.

Panic spreads faster than fire.

---

The raiders reached the ditch.

Some jumped in and began to scramble up the far side, slipping in mud.

Others threw bundles into it, trying to fill it quickly.

One man carried a clay pot with a cloth wick. He hurled it toward the palisade.

It shattered and oil splashed, slick and black, and for a moment the rain could not wash it away.

Then flame caught, stubborn, alive even in wet air.

That flame gave me what I needed.

Light.

I swung the six-pounder slightly, aiming not for one man but for the knot of bodies trying to climb the ditch.

"Grape," I ordered.

The gunner's eyes widened.

Grapeshot at this range was not war.

It was slaughter.

"Grape," I repeated, voice hard.

The gunner obeyed, hands moving fast.

The canvas bag of iron balls slid into the barrel.

The boy with the match leaned in, face tense, eyes blinking against rain.

I felt the whole crew hold its breath.

"Fire," I said.

The match touched the vent.

The gun spoke.

In monsoon night, a cannon flash is like lightning made by men.

The recoil slammed back. The carriage jolted, wheels skidding in mud.

The sound rolled down the line and into the jungle, and for a moment everything was visible.

Men in the ditch, mouths open.
Faces twisted in surprise.
Hands gripping wet earth.

Then the grapeshot hit.

The sound was different from a round shot.

Round shot makes a clean brutal impact.

Grapeshot makes a tearing sound, like iron fists punching into meat and bone.

The knot of bodies in the ditch collapsed inward.

Some men fell without a sound.

Some screamed and tried to crawl over the dead.

The ditch filled with movement, then with stillness.

The raiders hesitated.

Hesitation is a gift.

I took it.

"Again," I ordered.

The crew moved like a machine, fear turning them faster.

Sponge.
Load.
Ram.

The boy's hands shook so hard he spilled powder. I slapped his hand away and used my own fingers to wipe the spill, smearing it into mud.

Not tonight.

Not here.

We primed and fired again, aiming lower, sweeping the ditch line.

The second blast shredded the men who had been climbing and the men who had been pushing from behind.

The raiders broke.

Not all at once.

In small pieces.

A man turning away.
A man dragging another.
A torch dropped into mud, hissing out.

They ran back into the rain.

---

On the unfinished section, Travancore spearmen surged forward, shouting, stabbing down into the ditch at men who still moved.

The raiders fired matchlocks blindly as they retreated. One ball struck the palisade with a dull thud. Another hit a labourer in the shoulder and spun him around. He fell into mud and did not get up.

For a moment I thought I heard a rocket scream.

It might have been imagination.

It might have been wind through bamboo.

In monsoon night, everything sounds like a threat.

Then the sound faded, and only rain remained.

The raiders vanished into the jungle as quickly as they had appeared.

They had not come to win.

They had come to taste the wall.

To see whether it would bleed.

It had.

But it had not broken.

---

When the firing stopped, the darkness returned with a weight that felt physical.

Lanterns were relit along the line, their flames sheltered with trembling hands.

Men moved in the ditch, pulling bodies out, checking for breath, dragging the wounded toward the shelter where the healer waited with boiled water and cloth.

The ditch water was red-brown, rain and earth and blood mixing into one colour.

I climbed down from the bastion and walked the ditch line.

My boots sank. Mud sucked at my heels. The smell of powder hung in the air, sharp against wet earth.

The first body I saw was a young man, no older than my eldest son, his eyes open, his mouth filled with mud. An iron ball had taken him in the throat.

I stared at him longer than I should have.

A gunner's mind cannot help counting.

One discharge. Six-pounder. Grape load.
At this range, the pattern is tight.
The ditch becomes a funnel.

I could see, in my head, the spread of iron, the angles, the way bodies had collapsed where the shot cloud had been thickest.

I hated myself for that clarity.

I also knew the clarity was why the wall had held.

Hendrik arrived with rain on his hair, his face pale in lantern light.

"How many?" he asked.

I looked down the ditch.

"Seventeen," I said.

Hendrik's jaw tightened. "Ours?"

"Three," I replied. "One labourer. Two spearmen."

Hendrik nodded, satisfied in a way that made my stomach twist.

Numbers are comforting to men who want to believe war is manageable.

Caspar appeared then, dripping wet, sword in hand, as if he had run from wherever he had been sleeping the moment the first gun spoke.

His eyes went to the ditch, to the bodies, to the torn mud.

He did not make a joke.

That was how I knew it had reached him.

"They came to learn," he said finally, voice low.

I nodded.

Caspar's gaze moved to the wall line, still half built, still fragile.

"Then we must teach them something worth remembering," he said.

It was the first time he had spoken like a man who understood war was not only about feeling alive.

It was also about keeping others alive.

---

Later, when the bodies had been dragged away and the ditch had been scraped and the palisade fire had been smothered, I stood on the bastion again and looked into the rain.

The jungle beyond the cleared line was black and silent.

Somewhere inside it, men were walking back to Mysore with wet clothes and empty hands.

They would tell their officers what they had seen.

Guns under cover.
Grapeshot.
Men who fired fast in rain.

They would come back with a better plan.

That was what made Hyder different.

He learned.

As I stood there, I realised I was learning too.

Not about rockets.

About myself.

I had fired grape into men in a ditch and then counted bodies like a clerk.

I had measured death by accuracy.

The rain washed my face, cold and steady, and it did not cleanse anything.


# Chapter 22: Hendrik's Command

Inheritance is a weight that does not ask whether you are ready.

It drops onto your shoulders because blood has decided it should.

Hendrik had carried that weight since he was a boy. He carried it in the way he stood too straight, in the way he watched his father's face for approval he never quite received. He carried it in his cruelty to himself and his colder cruelty to others.

After the raid on the Lines, the weight became visible.

De Lannoy did not ride north to inspect the damage.

He could not.

Hendrik went instead.

---

The morning after the raid, the ditch stank of wet blood and disturbed earth.

Labourers worked with their faces turned away from the places where bodies had been dragged out. Men dig differently after they have watched someone die in the ditch they are shaping.

The palisade section that had burned was blackened, the wood charred and splintered. Rain had extinguished the flames, but it had not removed the smell. Burned oil clung to the air like a warning.

Hendrik arrived with a small escort and a writing clerk from Kesavadas' office. He dismounted without looking at the muddy ground, as if his boots were immune.

He walked the line with his hands clasped behind his back.

He asked questions in Malayalam, short and precise.

How many men on watch.
Where the lantern had been.
Which sentry had died first.
How quickly the alarm had been raised.

The officers answered with the careful voices of men who knew that one wrong word can end a career.

Hendrik listened without expression.

Then he called the surviving sentry captain forward.

The captain was a thick-necked man with scar tissue on his forearm and a missing ear. He had fought in the old days under Marthanda Varma. He had built his identity on being unbreakable.

Hendrik looked at him as if he were a faulty carriage bolt.

"The raiders reached the ditch before the alarm reached the bastion," Hendrik said.

It was not accusation. It was a measurement.

The captain swallowed. "Rain," he began. "The lantern went out. The men were-"

"The men were tired," Hendrik interrupted. "Yes. They were wet. Yes."

His voice stayed calm.

"Mysore does not stop because our men are tired," he said.

The captain's jaw tightened. "We held," he said.

"We survived," Hendrik corrected. "That is not the same thing."

He turned to the clerk.

"Write this," he said. "Double the night watch. Two lanterns at each post, one covered. No one stands alone. If a lantern goes out, the post calls immediately, even if it is nothing."

The clerk wrote quickly, reed scratching.

Hendrik looked back at the captain.

"And you," he said, "will be whipped."

The captain stared at him, stunned.

Whipping was for boys, for thieves, for men who had no honour. Not for a veteran captain.

The captain's hands clenched.

"For what?" he demanded.

Hendrik's eyes stayed steady.

"For teaching the men that the line can be soft," he said. "Softness spreads."

He gestured to the ditch.

"Do you see those bodies?" he asked.

The captain's gaze flicked toward the place where the raiders had fallen.

"They died because they came too close," Hendrik said. "Our men died because we let them come too close."

The captain's throat worked.

Hendrik's voice stayed even.

"You will be whipped in front of the men," he said. "Not because I enjoy it. Because they must understand the price of delay."

The captain's face flushed with anger and shame.

He opened his mouth again, and then he closed it.

He nodded, once, stiff.

He had understood what Hendrik was doing.

He was not punishing a man.

He was building fear into the line.

Fear is a kind of mortar.

---

I watched the exchange from the edge of the camp, and something in my chest tightened.

I understood Hendrik.

I also disliked him.

De Lannoy had built discipline too. He had used fear. He had whipped men. He had sent boys back to chains.

But De Lannoy's fear was aimed at carelessness, at stupidity, at things that could be corrected.

Hendrik's fear was aimed at the soul.

He wanted men to obey even when there was nothing to correct, only weather and exhaustion and the limits of the body.

He wanted obedience as a form of worship.

That worship could hold a line.

It could also break men.

Caspar watched too, leaning against a post, arms folded, rain dripping from his hair. His face was still, but his eyes were sharp.

When Hendrik walked away, Caspar muttered in Dutch, low enough that only I heard.

"He will whip the rain next," he said.

I did not respond.

Caspar's humour was a shield. It was also a knife he sometimes turned on the wrong people.

Hendrik turned toward me then.

"Your gun fired well," he said.

The words sounded like praise, but his face did not change.

"It held the ditch," I replied.

Hendrik nodded.

"We will place two guns there permanently," he said. "And another on the bend."

I hesitated. "The ground at the bend is still settling," I said. "A gun will sink unless we build a platform first."

Hendrik's gaze held on me.

"Then build a platform," he said.

It was that simple for him.

If the world does not obey, force it.

I felt irritation rise, sharp and childish.

I had spent years learning that the world has limits, that you work with those limits, not against them.

Hendrik had grown up watching his father bend the world. He believed bending was the same thing as breaking.

He looked at me again.

"You will oversee the gun platforms," he said.

Not will you. Not can you.

You will.

I nodded, because refusal was not possible.

Hendrik's gaze flicked toward the labourers, toward the ditch, toward the jungle beyond.

"When my father dies," he said abruptly, in Dutch, "this line will be mine."

The sentence landed without warning.

Caspar's head lifted slightly, as if he had been struck.

I stared at Hendrik.

He continued, voice controlled.

"The court will look at me and see his name," he said. "They will look at you and see a foreign gunner."

There was no malice in it.

Only realism.

It was the kind of realism that feels like a bruise.

"They will need you," Hendrik added. "But they will not follow you."

My throat tightened.

I wanted to argue. I wanted to say men follow competence. Men follow the man who keeps them alive.

But I had lived long enough to know competence is not the only thing men follow.

They follow blood.

They follow legitimacy.

They follow the story they have agreed to believe.

Hendrik looked at me with the cold clarity of a man accepting his role.

"So you will be my right hand," he said. "You will be the bridge. Do not mistake the bridge for the crown."

He turned away and walked toward the next section of the line.

Caspar watched him go, jaw tight.

Then he looked at me.

"Bridge," he said, spitting the word lightly. "How noble."

I did not answer.

I looked out into the rain and felt the truth settle.

I had survived Colachel.

I had been remade in this fort.

I had learned to see what was not yet there.

And still, when power shifted, it would not settle on me.

It would pass over me like a shadow.

That day, as Hendrik's orders snapped through the camp and the whip cracked later in the mud, I understood what my place would be when De Lannoy was gone.

Not commander.

Not heir.

Indispensable.

And invisible.


# Chapter 23: Lakshmi's Wisdom

When I came home from the Lines, my boots were full of mud and my head was full of bitterness.

Mud can be washed away.

Bitterness sinks in.

Lakshmi met me at the door and did not ask questions at first. She only took one look at my face and walked back inside, as if she had already decided what kind of evening it would be.

The house smelled of cooked rice and fish drying near the hearth. A lamp burned in the corner, its flame small and steady. Our children were on the floor with a wooden wheel, rolling it back and forth and arguing in the careless way only children can argue, as if the world will always have time for play.

Willem looked up when I entered.

"Father," he said, and there was hesitation in his voice now, as if he had learned that his father's return carried moods as well as stories.

Anna ran to me anyway, and pressed her damp hair against my coat.

"You smell like rain," she said, delighted.

Little Thomas stared at my boots and made a face.

"You brought the swamp," he announced.

I almost laughed.

Almost.

Lakshmi pointed at my boots.

"Outside," she said.

I obeyed.

I sat on the step and pulled the boots off, the mud sucking at leather. I scraped the worst of it away with a piece of wood and set the boots by the door, as if leaving the mud there would also leave the day's thoughts.

It did not.

When I came back inside, Lakshmi had already placed food on a leaf plate and set a cup of water beside it.

"Eat," she said.

Her voice was not gentle. It was practical.

I ate, because hunger is not improved by self-pity.

Lakshmi watched me for a while, her eyes steady, and then she spoke.

"Hendrik spoke to you," she said, watching my face.

I swallowed a mouthful of rice that tasted of nothing.

"Yes," I admitted.

Lakshmi nodded.

"He made you feel small," she said.

The words hit with uncomfortable accuracy.

"He reminded me of what I am," I said, trying to make it sound like philosophy instead of hurt.

Lakshmi's mouth tightened.

"Do not make your pain elegant," she said. "It is still pain."

The children quieted slightly, listening. Lakshmi looked at them and softened her voice by a fraction.

"Go to the back room," she told them. "Play there."

Willem hesitated, eyes flicking between us. Then he gathered the wooden wheel and shepherded Anna and Thomas toward the sleeping room.

When the curtain fell closed behind them, the house seemed to exhale.

Lakshmi sat opposite me and picked up a piece of fish, breaking it with her fingers.

"Tell me," she said.

So I did.

I told her about the whip in the mud.
I told her about Hendrik's calm voice.
I told her the sentence that had lodged under my ribs.

Do not mistake the bridge for the crown.

When I finished, I expected sympathy.

Sympathy is what I had learned to expect from women in European stories.

Lakshmi did not give me that.

She chewed the fish slowly, then swallowed, then looked at me as if deciding whether I was being foolish on purpose.

"You want the crown?" she asked.

The question was so blunt it made my face heat.

"No," I said quickly. "I do not want to command."

Lakshmi raised one eyebrow.

"Then why are you sulking like a boy whose toy was taken?" she asked.

The words stung.

They also made something in me loosen, because the sting was honest.

"Because," I said, and my voice sounded smaller than I wanted, "I have done the work. I have held the guns. I have learned the maps. I have bled in this land. And still, when the weight passes, it will not pass to me."

Lakshmi stared at me for a long moment.

Then she leaned forward slightly.

"Listen to me," she said.

Her voice was quiet now, and that quiet carried more force than shouting.

"You think too much about where you came from," she said. "Think about where you are."

The sentence landed in the room like a stone.

I opened my mouth to argue, and Lakshmi lifted her hand.

"Where you came from is a Company that would have left you in a ditch," she continued. "Where you came from is a church that would call my children bastards. Where you came from is men who count pepper and call it honour."

She pointed toward the back room where our children whispered.

"Where you are is a house that you built with your hands," she said. "Where you are is a land that lets you eat, and work, and raise children, even if it looks at you sideways."

Her eyes held mine.

"Where you are is me," she added, and her voice softened, not into sweetness, but into something more dangerous.

Truth.

I felt my throat tighten.

Lakshmi reached across the mat and took my hand.

Her fingers were warm and callused from work. Not soft. Not decorative.

"You are angry because Hendrik will be the name," she said. "And you will be the hands."

I did not deny it.

Lakshmi squeezed my hand.

"Names are for priests," she said. "Hands feed children."

She paused, then added, "And bridges keep people from drowning."

The last line surprised me.

I stared at her.

Lakshmi's mouth twitched, the smallest hint of a smile.

"Do you think a crown is heavy?" she asked. "Try being a bridge. Everyone walks on you. No one thanks you. But if you break, they all fall into the water."

She released my hand and sat back.

"So do not break," she said simply.

The words were not romantic.

They were a command.

And they were the closest thing to comfort she had ever given me.

---

Later, when the children were asleep, Lakshmi and I sat on the step and listened to the backwater.

The rain had eased. Frogs called. Somewhere a night bird cried once, sharp and lonely.

Lakshmi leaned her head against my shoulder, a rare gesture, and I felt the weight of her trust settle on me.

Not a crown.

A different weight.

The weight of being needed.

In the dark, I could see the outline of the fort wall against the sky.

I thought of Hendrik, walking the line with his hands clasped behind his back, building fear into men like mortar.

I thought of Caspar, hungry for meaning, burning himself to feel alive.

I thought of De Lannoy, fraying slowly, leaving his work behind.

And I thought of Lakshmi's hands in mine.

Hands feed children.

Bridges keep people from drowning.

Perhaps that was belonging.

# Chapter 24: The Last Order

On the first of June, 1777, De Lannoy died the way he lived.

Not with speeches.

With instructions.

---

The messenger came before dawn, knocking hard enough to wake the children.

Lakshmi sat up immediately, eyes alert. She did not ask who it was. She knew. In a soldier's house, knocks before sunrise only mean one thing.

I pulled on my coat and opened the door.

A fort boy stood there, rain dripping from his hair, breath coming fast.

"Sir," he said, and his voice broke on the word. "Captain De Lannoy. He is-"

He could not finish.

I felt a tightness in my chest that had nothing to do with fear.

"I am coming," I said.

Lakshmi was already tying her shawl, movements quick and practised.

"Go," she said to me, voice low. "Do not run. You will fall."

It was the kind of instruction she gave when she loved.

Practical.

I kissed the top of her head without thinking, a rare gesture that surprised us both, and stepped into the dark.

The rain was light, a fine mist that clung to skin. The fort path shone with wet stone.

As I walked, I thought of the first time I had seen De Lannoy at Colachel.

A man who had been my enemy.

A man who had chosen me out of a chain of prisoners.

Learn, and live.

Those words had built my life.

Now the man who had spoken them was dying.

---

De Lannoy's quarters were quiet.

Too quiet.

The fort yard is never quiet, not truly. Even at night there are men snoring, sentries shifting, rats scratching at grain.

This quiet was different.

It was the quiet of people holding their breath.

Margaret met me at the door.

Her face was pale, but her eyes were steady. She looked like a woman who had been preparing for this day for years, and still found herself unready.

"He asked for you," she said in Portuguese, because grief had loosened her careful language.

I nodded and stepped inside.

The room smelled of boiled herbs and lamp smoke. A priest's oil had been burned in one corner, and the sweet heavy scent of it mixed with the fort's constant smell of powder as if two worlds had been forced into the same small space.

De Lannoy lay on a low cot, propped up on pillows.

He looked smaller than he had ever looked in my memory.

Not weak, exactly.

Simply reduced.

His skin had gone waxy. His hands lay on the blanket, the fingers slightly curled as if still holding invisible reins.

Hendrik stood on one side of the cot, posture rigid. Caspar stood on the other side, arms folded, jaw tight, trying to look bored and failing completely.

The priest murmured prayers in Portuguese, low and rhythmic.

De Lannoy's eyes were closed.

His breathing was shallow, controlled, as if he was still trying to discipline his body into obedience.

When I stepped closer, his eyes opened.

They found mine immediately.

Sharp, even now.

"Pieter," he said in Dutch.

The sound of my name in that room hit me harder than any shout in battle.

"Captain," I replied, because habit does not die easily.

De Lannoy's mouth twitched, almost a smile.

"No titles," he said.

It was a small mercy.

He lifted one hand slightly.

I stepped closer and took it.

His grip was weak.

That weakness felt like an insult to the laws of the world.

Men like De Lannoy are not supposed to weaken.

They are supposed to die standing.

He squeezed my fingers once, a small pressure.

Then he spoke, quietly, each sentence measured.

"Listen," he said.

I did.

---

"The magazine," he said.

His voice was thin, but the old clarity was still there.

"Keep it dry," he continued. "No lanterns. No boys showing courage with matches."

Hendrik nodded sharply, as if the instruction was an order he could obey and therefore could bear.

De Lannoy's gaze flicked toward his son.

"Pay the men," he said.

He looked at Kesavadas' clerk standing near the door, as if he knew the clerk would carry these words into the books.

"Pay them on time," he repeated. "A hungry gunner is a traitor waiting."

The priest paused his murmuring for a heartbeat, startled by the bluntness in a deathbed room.

De Lannoy did not care.

He looked at Caspar.

"Do not drink when you are afraid," he said.

Caspar's face tightened. He opened his mouth, then closed it.

De Lannoy's gaze stayed on him.

"Drink when you are happy," he added, and for a moment I heard something in his voice that might have been humour. "It will be rarer."

Caspar's eyes flickered. His jaw worked. He nodded, stiff, as if accepting a command he did not want.

De Lannoy's eyes returned to me.

"You," he said.

The single word carried a weight that made my throat tighten.

"Teach," he said.

That was all.

Teach.

Not command.
Not lead.

Teach.

He had chosen my role and he had never pretended it would be something else.

I nodded, because there was nothing else I could do.

De Lannoy's gaze shifted toward the wall beyond the room, invisible but present in all our minds.

"Do not trust the Company," he said, voice thinning further.

Hendrik stiffened.

The priest's eyes flicked up, wary, as if the word Company was a demon's name.

De Lannoy continued anyway.

"They will smile," he said. "They will measure. They will offer help. They will put their hand on your shoulder and call it friendship."

His eyes found mine again.

"Do not confuse touch with loyalty," he said.

I thought of Hawkins' hand on my arm.

Brother.

The memory made my stomach twist.

De Lannoy's grip on my fingers tightened slightly, then loosened.

His breath hitched.

Margaret leaned in quickly, her hand on his forehead, whispering something in Portuguese that sounded like a prayer and a command at the same time.

De Lannoy swallowed.

"Bury me here," he said.

The priest began to speak again, louder now.

De Lannoy's eyes flicked toward him with irritation.

"Quiet," he rasped, and the priest fell silent, stunned.

De Lannoy looked at Margaret.

"Here," he repeated, softer. "In this soil."

Margaret's eyes filled, but she did not let the tears fall.

"Yes," she whispered.

De Lannoy's gaze moved one last time to his sons.

Hendrik leaned forward, desperate, words trapped behind discipline.

Caspar stood very still, his hands clenched.

De Lannoy did not say I love you.

Men like him do not.

He looked at them as if memorising their faces, then looked back at the ceiling.

His breath came in, thin.

Then it did not come out again.

For a moment, no one moved.

The fort held its breath.

Then Margaret made a small sound, not a cry, more a release, and she pressed her forehead to her husband's hand.

The priest began to murmur prayers again, shaken.

Hendrik stood straighter, as if the death had turned him into stone.

Caspar turned his face away sharply, shoulders trembling once, and then still.

I sat on the edge of the cot and held De Lannoy's hand until it cooled.

Not because I believed it mattered.

Because my body did not know what else to do.

---

When I finally stepped out into the fort yard, the sky was lightening.

Rain fell in fine mist, soft on my face.

The gunners were already moving, lighting sheltered lamps, checking ropes, arguing softly about nothing.

Work does not stop because a great man dies.

That is the cruelty of it.

That is also the mercy.

I stood under the eaves and watched the yard for a long time.

I felt older.

Not because years had passed.

Because the man who had carried part of the weight was gone, and the weight had shifted.

Teach, he had said.

Keep the magazine dry.
Pay the men.
Do not trust the Company.

Simple instructions.

Gun drill for the soul.

I turned toward the gun line and walked.

The day had begun.

# Chapter 25: The Funeral

They buried De Lannoy in the rain.

It felt appropriate.

He had lived most of his life in this wet green land, sweating under armour, arguing with kings, training boys who did not want to be trained. He had built walls that the monsoon tried to erase every year. The rain had been his constant enemy and his constant companion.

So the day they carried his body to the chapel, the sky opened and the water fell as if the world was trying to wash him back into the earth quickly.

---

The chapel filled before dawn.

Candles burned despite the damp, their flames small and stubborn. Wax dripped onto stone. The crucifix above the altar looked darker than usual, as if the carved Christ had absorbed the grief in the room.

De Lannoy's coffin lay in front of the altar, plain wood, no ornament. Margaret had insisted on simplicity. She said he had hated displays. She was right.

A cross rested on the lid.

The Portuguese priest murmured prayers in a voice that shook. He had known De Lannoy for years, not as a penitent, but as a force. Priests are used to men who confess and beg. They are less used to men who order and build.

Margaret knelt by the coffin, her rosary moving through her fingers like a habit that could keep her from breaking.

Hendrik stood behind her, straight as a spear. Caspar stood beside him, arms folded, his face hard in the way men make their faces when they are trying not to feel.

The congregation was larger than it had ever been on an ordinary Sunday.

Parava fishermen.
Latin Catholic traders from the coast.
Travancore officers in cloth darkened by rain.
Gunners from Udayagiri, their hands clean for once, their eyes raw.

And, standing near the chapel door, a court delegation sent by the king.

Raja Kesavadas was there.

He wore plain cloth, no jewellery, and he watched the coffin with the same attention he watched pepper scales. Not cold. Accurate.

There was also a Company man, not in uniform, his coat dark, his face pale. He stood with his hat in his hands and his eyes measuring the room.

Even here, even now, the Company measured.

I stood near the back, close to the wall, as I had stood for years in rooms where I did not fully belong.

The smell of incense mixed with damp cloth and human breath. A low murmur of Portuguese and Malayalam filled the spaces between prayers.

I could not stop thinking of the first time I had smelled De Lannoy's world.

Powder.
Oil.
Discipline.

Now the smell was wax and rain and the end of an era.

---

The priest spoke of salvation.

He spoke of mercy.

He spoke of a man who had served God through service to others.

It was the only way he could make sense of De Lannoy's life in priestly language.

I listened and found my mind drifting toward other memories.

De Lannoy's crop tapping my wrist.
His voice saying, again.
His hand wrapping my burned palm.

Learn, and live.

What do you do when the man who taught you that dies?

You learn anyway.

You live anyway.

The prayers ended.

The priest raised his hand, made the sign of the cross over the coffin, and stepped back.

Margaret stood slowly, her knees stiff.

Hendrik moved forward at once, as if duty had been waiting for an opening.

He placed his hand on the coffin lid.

Not as a son.

As a successor.

I saw eyes in the chapel shift toward him.

The court delegation.
The Company man.
The officers.

They were all watching the same thing.

Who would hold what De Lannoy had built?

Hendrik lifted his chin slightly and met their gaze without flinching.

He was ready for this moment in the way only a man raised under a legend can be ready.

Caspar did not move.

His gaze stayed on the coffin as if refusing to acknowledge the watchers.

I understood him.

Being watched is another kind of capture.

---

When the coffin was carried out, the rain greeted it like an old friend.

Men lifted the wood carefully. The bearers were gunners, not priests. De Lannoy belonged to them more than he belonged to any church.

The procession moved from the chapel toward the small burial ground behind it, where a patch of earth had been cleared and a grave dug deep enough to keep animals out.

Mud clung to feet. Cloth darkened. The world smelled of wet soil.

The Company man followed too, stepping carefully as if afraid the mud might stain his status.

Kesavadas walked with the delegation, head bowed.

Hendrik walked behind the coffin, his face rigid.

Caspar walked beside him, jaw clenched.

Margaret walked last, her shoulders straight, refusing to let the rain make her look like she was weeping.

I walked near the end, and as we passed the fort wall I saw Lakshmi standing under a tree with our children.

She did not come into the chapel. It was not her place, and she knew the world well enough not to force it.

But she had come near.

Willem stood beside her, expression solemn, eyes following the coffin with the strange seriousness children sometimes wear when they sense the world has changed.

Anna held Lakshmi's hand tightly.

Little Thomas looked confused.

Lakshmi met my gaze briefly.

Not sympathy.

Acknowledgement.

This matters.

I nodded and kept walking.

---

At the grave, the priest spoke the final words in Portuguese, voice hoarse.

Then the coffin was lowered.

Ropes creaked.
Wood scraped against earth.

When the coffin settled, the sound was dull, final.

Margaret stepped forward and dropped a handful of soil into the grave.

The soil hit the lid with a soft thud.

Hendrik followed, his hand steady.

Caspar hesitated, then stepped forward and dropped his soil in with a motion that looked almost angry.

Then it was my turn.

I did not know what was expected of me.

I was not Catholic.
I was not family.
I was not local.

I was a man built out of De Lannoy's work.

I stepped forward and let the soil fall through my fingers.

The damp earth clung to my skin.

In that moment, I felt a strange clarity.

This was belonging.

Not a church.

Not a flag.

A grave in the land that had used you and kept you.

---

When the grave was filled and the mound shaped, the crowd began to disperse.

People spoke softly, as if loud voices might wake the dead.

The Company man approached Hendrik with a careful smile.

"Captain De Lannoy was a remarkable man," he said in Portuguese.

Hendrik replied with cold courtesy.

"He served Travancore well," he said.

The Company man nodded, then glanced at me.

"And you," he said, and he switched into English as if enjoying the language, "you were his right hand."

It was not praise.

It was a reminder that the Company had been watching for years.

I bowed slightly.

Kesavadas came to Hendrik next.

He spoke in Malayalam, quiet and precise.

"The king sends his respect," he said. "He also sends his expectation. The wall must hold. The Lines must be finished. The guns must be ready."

Hendrik nodded.

"They will be," he said.

Kesavadas' gaze shifted to me.

For a moment I thought he would speak to me too.

Instead he only nodded, as if acknowledging my existence and my usefulness in the same motion.

Then he turned away.

The handover was happening in small gestures, not declarations.

De Lannoy was being buried.

His work was not.

---

That evening, back at the fort, Hendrik called the gunners into the yard.

The rain had eased. The sky was grey. The walls dripped.

Hendrik stood on the step of the shed where De Lannoy had stood a thousand times.

His voice carried.

"Captain De Lannoy is dead," he said.

There was no softness in the sentence.

The gunners stood still, faces blank, hands clasped.

"His work remains," Hendrik continued. "The king remains. The wall remains. Mysore remains."

He paused.

"So we remain," he said.

He looked over the yard, eyes hard.

"Drill begins at first light," he said. "No excuses. No mourning that delays work. If you want to honour him, load correctly."

The words were harsh.

They were also true in the only language De Lannoy had trusted.

Work.

I stood at the edge of the yard and watched Hendrik take his father's place.

Some men looked relieved to have an order to follow.

Some looked resentful.

Caspar stood apart, expression unreadable, and when Hendrik finished speaking he turned and walked away into the rain without a word.

I went home to Lakshmi and the children and ate rice and fish with hands that still smelled faintly of damp earth.

That night I dreamed of a gun yard full of smoke, and a man with a crop pointing at me out of the haze.

Learn, and live.

The dream did not change.

Only the voice did.


# Chapter 26: The Heir of Udayagiri

When De Lannoy was alive, he did not need paper to be powerful.

He had built the fort. Men obeyed him because he had taught them that obedience meant survival. The king obeyed him sometimes because the king understood the value of a foreign mind that did not share local pride.

After De Lannoy died, paper arrived.

Seals.
Orders.
Titles.

As if ink could replace a man.

---

The letter came from Padmanabhapuram three days after the funeral.

It was carried by a palace messenger in clean cloth, protected from rain with an oilskin wrap. The messenger held it as if it were sacred.

Hendrik received it in the shed, standing behind De Lannoy's old table.

His face stayed blank as he broke the wax.

Caspar leaned against the doorway, arms folded, watching with the hard impatience of a man who hated ceremonies that did not involve danger.

I stood to one side, as I always did in moments when power was being rearranged.

Hendrik unfolded the palm-leaf document and read it once, then again.

His throat moved.

He held it out to me without looking.

"Read," he said in Dutch.

The words were in Malayalam, formal and precise. They named Hendrik De Lannoy as commander of Udayagiri Fort's artillery and defensive works. They thanked him for his father's service. They reminded him that the Lines must be completed. They reminded him that Travancore expected loyalty.

Loyalty is always mentioned when a kingdom is afraid it might not receive it.

I handed the letter back.

Hendrik nodded, the motion small but final.

Caspar made a sound, half laugh, half snort.

"Congratulations," he said in Dutch. "Now you are a piece of paper."

Hendrik's eyes snapped to him.

"Now I am responsible," Hendrik replied.

Caspar's smile was sharp. "You were always responsible," he said. "You just have a seal now to make you feel better."

Hendrik stepped forward, anger controlled into a cold edge.

"This is not about feeling," he said. "This is about command."

Caspar's gaze flicked to the wall beyond the shed, then back.

"Command is about men," he said. "Not seals."

For a moment I thought they would fight there in the shed, over their dead father's table.

Then Hendrik turned away, as if refusing to give Caspar the satisfaction of a scene.

"We leave for Padmanabhapuram at dawn," he said. "The king will confirm it in person."

Caspar rolled his eyes.

Hendrik looked at me.

"You will come," he said.

I nodded.

Caspar's gaze sharpened.

"Of course he will," he murmured. "The bridge must attend the coronation."

---

The palace audience was not grand.

Dharma Raja did not like grandness. He preferred rooms where the air held every word and no one could hide behind drums.

The chamber smelled of sandalwood and lamp smoke. The king sat on a simple seat with a cloth draped over it, his posture straight, his face calm.

Raja Kesavadas stood to one side with a writing board.

A Brahmin priest stood near the wall, watching everything with an expression that made judgement look like a religious duty.

A Company agent was present too, as if the English believed they should be in every room where power shifted. He wore plain cloth, but his eyes were the eyes of a man who considered himself entitled.

Hendrik bowed deeply.

"Your Highness," he said in Malayalam, voice controlled.

Dharma Raja looked at him for a long moment.

Then he spoke, quiet.

"Your father held my walls," he said. "He held them with work. Not with blood."

The sentence sounded almost like praise.

Hendrik's jaw tightened.

"I will do the same," he said.

Dharma Raja's gaze moved briefly to me, then back to Hendrik.

"Do not try to be him," the king said. "Be what the wall needs now."

I felt that sentence settle in my bones. Dharma Raja spoke like a man who understood change even when he did not love it.

Kesavadas read the appointment aloud, formal. Hendrik accepted it with the correct words, the correct bows.

Then the king asked the question that mattered.

"How much powder in Udayagiri?" he said.

Hendrik answered without hesitation.

The king asked how many barrels were spoiled by the magazine fire.

Hendrik answered.

The king asked how many men were on the Lines tonight.

Hendrik answered.

Dharma Raja nodded, satisfied not by ceremony but by numbers.

"Then go," he said. "Hold what my uncle built."

The audience ended.

The power had shifted.

No drums.

No swords.

Only a king's quiet voice and a man with new responsibility walking out into the courtyard.

---

On the ride back to Udayagiri, Hendrik spoke little.

The letter was now in his coat, close to his body, as if the paper could warm him.

At the fort gate, men saluted him differently.

Not out of love.

Out of recognition.

Recognition is how authority becomes real.

Hendrik went directly to the gun yard and called the crews into line.

His voice carried.

"Captain De Lannoy built this fort," he said. "He is dead. The fort remains."

He paused.

"I command it now," he said.

No flourish.

No apology.

The gunners stood still.

Some looked resentful.
Some looked relieved.
Most looked tired.

Hendrik continued.

"Pieter van der Berg will oversee gunnery training," he said.

There was a murmur then, small and quick.

My name spoken in that yard felt strange.

Hendrik did not look at me.

He did not say my name with warmth.

He said it as he might have said rope or powder.

Useful.

Indispensable.

Then he dismissed the men and began drilling as if grief had never existed.

---

Caspar did not stay in the yard.

He watched Hendrik for a while, face blank, and then walked away toward the outer wall.

I found him later by the ditch, staring north.

The air smelled of wet earth. The jungle beyond the cleared line looked peaceful, which was the most dangerous kind of lie.

Caspar's hands were in his pockets. His shoulders were tense.

"He has the title," Caspar said without turning.

"Yes," I replied.

Caspar's mouth twisted. "And you have the work," he said.

His voice carried no envy of me. Only bitterness toward the shape of the world.

"And what do you have?" I asked.

Caspar laughed once, sharp.

"Nothing," he said. "No title. No work that matters. Only time."

Time.

The word sounded like a curse in his mouth.

He looked at me then, eyes bright with restless anger.

"War is coming," he said. "Everyone can smell it. And still we dig and drill and pretend the world will wait for us to be ready."

He gestured toward the jungle.

"I want it to come," he admitted, voice low. "I want it to test us. I want it to stop being rumour."

I stared at him.

It was an honest desire.

It was also a dangerous one.

"You want war because peace makes you feel useless," I said.

Caspar's jaw tightened.

"Peace makes me feel dead," he corrected.

He turned away again, staring north.

"My father is in the ground," he said quietly. "And Hendrik wears his name like armour. And you carry his work like a pack animal."

His voice roughened.

"Where do I put my hands?" he asked. "What do I build? What do I inherit?"

The question hung in the damp air.

I had no answer that would satisfy him.

Because the truth was cruel.

Caspar had inherited courage.

He had not inherited a place to put it.

That night, Hendrik wrote orders by lamplight.

I revised drill routines and corrected range tables.

Caspar drank in a shed by the wall and stared into a cup as if waiting for it to answer the question he had asked me.

De Lannoy was buried.

The fort was still standing.

And the sons he left behind were beginning to pull against each other like ropes tied to the same gun.


# Chapter 27: Caspar's Choice

Grief does not make men noble.

It reveals what they already are.

After De Lannoy was buried, Hendrik became colder. He poured his grief into orders and drill, as if the fort could be held together by discipline alone.

Caspar became louder.

He drank more openly, laughed more sharply, picked fights with anyone who looked at him too long.

He was trying to feel alive in a world that had taken his father and replaced him with paper.

The scandal began in a drinking shed.

Most scandals do.

---

The shed by the outer wall had always been a place where gunners went to forget the weight of iron.

It was not officially permitted.

It was tolerated.

A fort is like a gun. If you keep it too tight, it bursts.

That night the rain had stopped, and the air smelled of wet earth and cheap arrack.

Caspar sat on an upturned crate with a cup in hand, his shoulders loose, his eyes too bright. Two gunners sat with him, laughing at something that was not funny enough to deserve the laughter they gave it.

I should not have been there.

I went because Lakshmi's words about bridges were still in my head, and I knew that if Caspar broke, it would crack the whole family.

I sat at the edge of the shed and watched him drink.

Caspar noticed me and grinned.

"Come to drag me back to virtue?" he asked in Dutch.

"Come to make sure you do not set yourself on fire," I replied.

Caspar laughed, and the laugh was too sharp.

"Fire is honest," he said. "People are not."

Then the Company lieutenant walked in.

He wore no red coat. He wore plain cloth, but his posture was uniform. He had the same narrow face I remembered from years before, the mouth that looked permanently dissatisfied.

He had been with Hawkins once. Now he had returned with a new assignment and the same hungry eyes.

He scanned the shed and saw Caspar.

His gaze lingered.

Then he smiled.

"Well," he said in English, loud enough for everyone to hear, "the Frenchman's whelp drinks like an Englishman."

The gunners did not understand the words, but they understood the tone.

Caspar's grin did not change. Only his eyes did.

"I am not French," Caspar replied in English, his accent rough but clear. "And I am not your dog."

The lieutenant laughed.

"No," he said. "You are something else. Half made."

The words landed in the shed like a match dropped near powder.

I felt my stomach tighten.

Caspar set his cup down slowly.

"Say it again," he said.

The lieutenant shrugged, careless.

"Half made," he repeated. "Half European, half native. A man without a proper place. Your father defected. You inherited his shame."

Silence filled the shed.

Even the gunners felt it.

Caspar stood.

He moved with a smoothness that meant danger.

"My father built your Company's nightmares," he said quietly. "You should choose your words carefully."

The lieutenant smiled again, and the smile was the smile of a man who had never been hit hard enough to learn caution.

"Your father built the king's walls," he said. "Now he is in the ground. The Company is still here."

He leaned in slightly.

"It is the Company's time now," he said. "Men like you will learn where you belong."

Caspar's hand moved to his belt.

I stood too fast, the crate scraping.

"Caspar," I said, warning.

He did not look at me.

He stepped closer to the lieutenant.

"Outside," Caspar said.

The lieutenant's eyes gleamed.

"Gladly," he replied.

Men moved out of the way, instinctively. Even drunk gunners understand when a blade is coming.

They stepped into the night.

---

The coconut grove outside the fort wall was dark, the ground slick with damp leaves. The moon was a pale smear behind clouds.

The lieutenant drew his small sword with a flourish meant for an audience.

Caspar drew his blade without flourish.

Not a small sword.

A heavier fighting blade, the kind De Lannoy had always insisted on carrying even when European officers called it crude.

Caspar held it loosely, as if it were part of his hand.

The lieutenant glanced at the weapon and laughed.

"Savage steel," he said.

Caspar did not answer.

He stepped forward and cut.

Fast.

The lieutenant barely parried. The clang of metal sounded loud in the wet air.

The lieutenant's smile vanished.

He backed a step, then lunged, trying to recover pride with aggression.

Caspar moved aside and struck the lieutenant's sword arm with the flat of his blade, hard enough to make the man yelp.

The lieutenant stumbled, eyes wide now.

Caspar could have ended it then.

He did not.

He did not want a corpse.

He wanted recognition.

The lieutenant raised his sword again, breathing hard.

Caspar shook his head slightly, almost sad.

"You talk too much," he said.

Then he stepped in and cut the lieutenant's cheek.

Not deep.

Enough to draw blood.

Enough to mark.

The lieutenant froze, hand rising to his face, fingers coming away red.

The sight of his own blood seemed to surprise him.

Caspar lowered his sword.

"Go back to Madras," he said quietly. "Tell them you met a half-made man."

The lieutenant's eyes burned with humiliation.

He lifted his sword again.

And then Hendrik's voice snapped through the grove.

"Stop."

Torches flared. Travancore soldiers poured into the grove, spears leveled. Hendrik walked at their head, face pale with fury.

He looked at the lieutenant's bleeding face, then at Caspar's sword.

Then he looked at me.

For a moment I saw betrayal in his eyes.

Not because I had planned it.

Because I had failed to prevent it.

Hendrik's voice stayed calm.

"Put down the blade," he ordered Caspar in Malayalam.

Caspar held the lieutenant's gaze for another heartbeat, then lowered his sword to the ground.

The lieutenant's chest heaved. He looked at Hendrik as if expecting apology.

Hendrik gave him none.

"You," Hendrik said to the lieutenant in Portuguese, cold and precise, "will return to your camp now."

The lieutenant opened his mouth.

Hendrik raised his hand, and the lieutenant stopped, startled by the authority in the motion.

"If you speak of this in Padmanabhapuram," Hendrik continued, "you will speak of your insult as well as your wound."

The lieutenant's eyes narrowed.

He understood the threat.

He swallowed, nodded stiffly, and walked away into the dark, one hand pressed to his cheek.

Hendrik turned to Caspar.

"Inside," he said.

Caspar did not move.

"No," Caspar replied in Dutch.

Hendrik's jaw tightened. "Do not make this worse," he hissed.

Caspar's eyes flashed.

"Worse?" he said. "He called our father a traitor in your fort. He called me half made. You want me to bow?"

Hendrik stepped close, voice low.

"I want you to understand that your pride is not more important than the fort," he said.

Caspar's laugh was bitter.

"Your fort," he corrected.

The words were a knife.

Hendrik's face went hard.

"Yes," he said. "My fort. My responsibility. And you have just threatened it."

He gestured to the soldiers.

"Tie him," he ordered.

The soldiers hesitated.

Caspar's eyes widened, not in fear, in fury.

"Do it," Hendrik snapped.

The rope came out.

Caspar did not fight it.

That was what surprised me.

He stood still as they tied his wrists, his face expressionless.

He was making a choice.

Not to beg.

Not to plead.

Not to hide behind his father's grave.

He would accept punishment.

He would not accept humiliation.

---

Hendrik held him in the fort guard room overnight.

In the morning, Hendrik summoned Kesavadas' messenger and wrote a report in careful Malayalam.

Company lieutenant insulted.
Duel prevented from becoming death.
Fort discipline compromised.

Hendrik wrote as if he were building a wall out of words.

Then he called Caspar out into the shed.

Caspar's face was bruised where the rope had rubbed. His eyes were clear, sober, and full of something like relief.

Hendrik stood behind the table, the appointment letter still folded in his coat as if he needed to feel it.

"You will apologise to the Company lieutenant," Hendrik said, voice flat.

Caspar stared at him.

"No," he replied.

Hendrik's jaw tightened.

"Then you will be confined," he said. "And you will be stripped of duty. You will not carry a blade in this fort again."

Caspar's mouth twitched, almost a smile.

"You think that will punish me?" he asked. "You think taking war away will make me smaller?"

Hendrik leaned forward slightly.

"It will make you harmless," he said.

Caspar's eyes flashed.

"Harmless is death," he said.

Silence filled the shed.

Then Caspar spoke again, slower.

"Give me the Lines," he said.

Hendrik stared at him.

Caspar continued.

"Put me on the northern works," he said. "The most exposed section. The place raiders test first."

He lifted his bound wrists slightly.

"If you want me punished, make me useful," he said. "Give me mud and rain and watch duty. Give me the part of the wall that bleeds."

Hendrik's gaze held on him, hard.

"You are offering this so you can find danger again," Hendrik said.

Caspar nodded.

"Yes," he admitted. "And so you can tell Kesavadas you did not spare me."

He met Hendrik's eyes.

"I will not beg," he said. "But I will work."

The sentence surprised me.

Work.

De Lannoy's language.

Hendrik looked at Caspar for a long time.

Then he glanced at me.

The glance held a question.

Can he be trusted?

I thought of Caspar running into smoke.
Caspar bleeding for a fort.
Caspar unable to live in peace.

"He will hold a post," I said quietly. "If the post gives him something real to hold."

Hendrik turned back to Caspar.

"You go north at sunset," he said.

Caspar exhaled, a small release.

"And if you disgrace us again," Hendrik added, voice cold, "I will not send you to mud. I will send you away."

Caspar nodded.

"I understand," he said.

Hendrik stepped around the table and cut the rope from Caspar's wrists himself.

It was a gesture that was not mercy.

It was command.

Caspar rubbed his wrists once, then straightened.

"No apology?" he asked, and there was humour in it now, lighter.

Hendrik's eyes narrowed.

"No apology," Caspar answered for him.

He turned to me.

"Bridge," he said, and the word sounded less like an insult now. "Come see me off."

That evening, as Caspar walked out of Udayagiri with a small detachment of spearmen and a pack mule carrying his gear, he looked more alive than he had since his father's burial.

He was going to the wall that bleeds.

Hendrik watched from the parapet, face unreadable.

I stood beside him and understood the shape of the choice Hendrik had made.

He had punished his brother without breaking him.

He had sent his fire north where it might burn the enemy instead of the fort.

And he had done it without leaning on his father's name.

That was command.

Not paper.

Not seals.

Decisions that cost.

# Chapter 28: Pollilur's Echo

In 1780, Pollilur reached Travancore as a sickness.

At first it was a rumour, carried by merchants who had never seen a battlefield but could smell panic on the roads. They spoke of an English Company column destroyed. Of a defeat so complete that even Madras had gone quiet.

Then came the dispatch.

Paper, again.

Paper that felt heavier than cannon.

---

The courier arrived at Udayagiri at midday, his horse lathered, his own face grey with exhaustion.

He carried a packet sealed in red wax with the English Company's mark.

Hendrik broke the seal in the shed and read the first lines.

His face did not change, but I saw his fingers tighten on the paper.

He handed it to me without speaking.

The letter was in English, written in a hurried hand, the kind of hand that has been forced to write while men are still dying somewhere nearby.

Colonel Baillie's detachment destroyed near Pollilur.
Company infantry squares broken.
Heavy casualties.
Rockets employed in great number.

I read the lines twice.

The shed felt too small.

Outside, the fort yard continued.

Men laughed.
Guns were cleaned.
A boy carried water.

The world was behaving as if a truth had not just arrived that should have changed everything.

Hendrik watched my face.

"Tell me," he said in Dutch.

So I did.

As I translated, I heard my own voice sound wrong, as if I were reading a death sentence in a language that could not fully hold it.

When I finished, Hendrik was silent for a long moment.

Then he looked at the courier.

"Did you see it?" he asked in Portuguese.

The courier swallowed.

"I did not," he said. "But I brought a man who did."

He gestured toward the yard.

Two sepoys stepped into the shed carrying another man between them.

The man was wrapped in cloth stained with old blood.

His face was burnt on one side, the skin tight and shiny. His left eye was swollen shut.

He smelled of smoke that had been in him for days.

The sepoys lowered him onto the floor.

The wounded man tried to sit up, pride fighting pain.

"I can speak," he rasped in Malayalam.

His accent was coastal.

He was not a Tamil from Madras.

He was one of ours.

That detail hit me harder than the dispatch.

If Pollilur could reach into our blood, then the war was already here.

---

His name was Raman.

He was a havildar in Company service, a man who had learned European drill and carried it in his bones.

He looked at Hendrik, then at me, eyes fever-bright.

"You are the Parangi gunner," he said, voice hoarse. "The one who serves the king."

I nodded.

Raman swallowed and began to speak, and as he spoke I realised he had been holding the story inside him like a burning coal. He needed to put it somewhere else.

"We marched to join the main force," he said. "Colonel Baillie. We were late. The sun was cruel. The men were thirsty. We were carrying powder and provisions in carts, and the wheels sank in sand."

His voice tightened.

"Hyder's men watched us," he continued. "We knew they were there. We could smell them."

He paused, breathing hard, then forced himself onward.

"They attacked in the morning," he said. "Cavalry first. They came like a wave."

His uninjured hand moved, making the shape in the air.

"We formed square," he said, and there was a reverence in his voice, the reverence of a man speaking of the one thing he trusted.

"Perfect square," he added, as if precision could save.

He looked at me, eyes intense.

"You know square," he said.

"Yes," I replied.

Raman nodded. "Bayonets out. Officers inside. Drums beating. We fired volleys. The cavalry could not break us. They circled. They charged again. They fell."

His voice lifted for a moment, pride rising.

"We held," he said.

Then his face changed.

The pride drained away like blood from a cut.

"Then the rockets came," he whispered.

The shed went still.

Even the courier stopped breathing.

Raman's eyes went distant, as if he was no longer in Udayagiri but back in that dry heat with smoke in his lungs.

"They came in hundreds," he said. "Not a few. Not scouts. Teams. Lines of men lighting fuses like they were lighting lamps."

His hand trembled.

"They screamed," he said. "The sky screamed."

He swallowed hard.

"The first rockets fell outside the square," he continued. "They burst in sand. Iron flew. Men were hit in legs. In arms. We tightened. Officers shouted to hold."

He laughed then, a thin broken sound.

"Hold," he repeated. "Hold is what they always say."

His voice dropped again.

"Then one rocket came over the corner," he said. "It did not miss. It came into the square."

I felt cold spread down my spine.

Raman's breath hitched.

"It hit a powder cart," he said. "A cart inside the square. We kept it inside because we thought it was safe."

His eyes filled, but no tears fell.

"The cart exploded," he whispered.

The word exploded was too small for what he described.

"The square became fire," he said. "Men became fire. The bayonets were still pointing out, but inside was burning."

He closed his good eye briefly, and when he opened it the look in it was the look of a man who has seen a truth that cannot be unseen.

"We could not breathe," he said. "Smoke trapped. Screaming trapped. The officers shouted to hold formation while the formation was burning."

He shook his head.

"Then the cavalry came again," he said. "Not to break the square. To push the burning men."

His voice cracked.

"We tried to open," he said. "We tried to run. But a square is a cage. The men in the middle died first because they had nowhere to go."

He stared at the floor.

"Discipline became a way to die neatly," he said.

The sentence landed in me like shot.

I had heard echoes of it before in rumours and wounds.

Now it was spoken by a man whose skin had been burned by that neat death.

Raman lifted his gaze to Hendrik.

"Colonel Baillie died," he said. "Many officers died. Some ran. Most of us ran. Not because we were cowards. Because we were on fire."

He looked at me again.

"The rockets did not have to hit every man," he said quietly. "They only had to hit enough."

Enough.

The word again.

---

When Raman finished, the shed was silent.

Hendrik's face was pale.

The courier stared at the floor.

I felt my hands shaking and forced them still by gripping the edge of the table.

I had admired the square once.

I had seen it as a symbol of European discipline, a proof that training could overcome fear.

Now I saw it as a target.

A perfect shape for rockets to find.

I looked at the rough map of the Lines pinned to the shed wall.

I saw, suddenly, every place where we had been tempted to build neatness.

Neat ranks.
Neat drills.
Neat confidence.

All of it was a gift to Mysore.

Raman coughed, a wet ugly sound.

Blood flecked his lip.

The healer, who had been waiting near the door, stepped forward with water and cloth.

Raman drank, then grabbed my wrist weakly.

"Do not form square," he whispered.

His fingers were light on my skin, but the urgency was heavy.

"Do not give them targets," he said. "Do not let men stand close when the sky can burn."

I nodded, because there was nothing else I could do.

---

That night I rewrote the fort's doctrine.

Not in speeches.

In orders.

Gunners dispersed. Covered positions. Traverses between batteries to break blast.
Infantry drilled to take cover, not to stand proud.
No tight formations on open ground.
Rocket crews targeted first. Aim for the flash of launch. Counter-battery fire without hesitation.

Hendrik came into the shed before midnight and found me writing.

He read my notes without speaking.

When he finished, he looked at me.

"This is not European drill," he said.

"Europe does not own discipline," I replied.

Hendrik's jaw tightened.

"My father built this fort with European knowledge," he said.

"He built it with what worked," I said. "If it stops working, we change."

Hendrik stared at the paper as if it were an insult.

Then, slowly, he nodded.

"Do it," he said.

He turned to leave, then stopped at the door.

"Raman," he said, voice low, almost reluctant. "Will he live?"

I hesitated.

"I do not know," I admitted.

Hendrik's shoulders tensed, then settled.

"Then keep him alive if you can," he said.

It was the closest Hendrik came to tenderness.

He left the shed.

I sat alone with the paper, the ink still wet.

In the distance, beyond the wall, the jungle was quiet.

But now I could hear rockets in that quiet.

Not the sound itself.

The possibility.

Pollilur had not happened in Travancore.

But its echo had reached us.

And I knew, with a certainty that tasted like smoke, that the Lines would be tested.

# Chapter 29: The Lines Tested

After Pollilur, men stopped laughing at my covered positions.

They still complained, because soldiers complain the way they breathe, but the tone changed. The complaints became quieter. The jokes became less certain.

When you have heard of a square burning from the inside, you begin to respect ugly precautions.

I drilled the infantry on the Lines not to stand proud, but to disappear.

That was what it felt like to them.

To crouch behind earthwork.
To fire through loopholes.
To move in small groups instead of neat blocks.

"This is not soldiering," one veteran muttered once. "This is rabbit work."

I looked at him and answered with the only truth that mattered.

"Rabbits live," I said. "Neat men die."

They did not like the sentence.

But they remembered Pollilur.

So they crouched.

So they learned.

---

The first serious probe came in the early hours of a grey morning, when the sky was heavy with the promise of rain.

Caspar's outpost sent the signal first.

Three horn blasts, low and urgent, carried along the line.

Then a torch flared on the northern bend, not a labourer's torch but a warning.

Men moved.

Not running in a cluster.

Moving as they had been drilled.

In twos and threes, keeping space, keeping breath, keeping the wall between their bodies and the open ground.

I was at the central battery, the one we had built thicker after De Lannoy's last approval. Two guns sat under rough cover, their barrels already uncovered, their vents checked, their powder charges protected under oilskin.

Hendrik was there too, face set, sword at his hip, his posture rigid as if stiffness could keep fear from entering.

He did not speak much.

He watched.

And that watching told the men everything.

This mattered.

---

The first rockets came before we saw the enemy.

A faint hiss.

Then the scream, rising out of the wet air like an animal in pain.

The rocket arced over the cleared ground and burst in the open space where men would have formed ranks if we had been foolish enough to obey old doctrine.

The explosion threw mud and smoke.

Iron fragments snapped through air.

No one screamed.

Because no one was there.

The second rocket fell closer, skidding in the wet earth, spinning, then bursting against the ditch edge.

Water splashed up, dirty and violent.

Two men behind a loophole flinched, but they did not break.

They had been told to expect it.

Expectation is a kind of armour.

The third rocket screamed overhead and struck a covered position farther down the line.

The cover shuddered.

A man inside yelled once, sharp, then went silent.

So the wall bled.

But it did not burn from the inside the way Raman had described.

That difference mattered.

---

The enemy infantry appeared next, moving in loose lines through the scrub, their cloth dark, their matchlocks held low. They did not rush.

They advanced the way a machine advances.

They fired in volleys that sounded wrong in this wet green place, a European rhythm carried into Indian soil.

Shots struck earthwork and thudded into wood.

One ball found a loophole and hit a young spearman in the mouth.

He went down without a sound, as if his life had been switched off.

I watched his body slump and felt my jaw tighten.

There is no doctrine that stops every death.

There is only doctrine that reduces it.

The Travancore infantry returned fire from the loopholes, scattered, controlled.

No lines.

No flags.

Just men aiming at shapes in scrub.

Then came the cavalry.

Hyder's horsemen burst out of the mist on the left flank, riding hard, shouting. They aimed for the unfinished section where the ditch was shallower.

They had learned our weak points too.

Hendrik's voice snapped across the battery.

"Left. Case shot."

The gun crew moved fast.

I watched the cavalry and felt the old instinct to admire speed and bravery.

Then I remembered Raman burning in a square.

Bravery is cheap.

Survival is not.

---

The rockets kept coming.

Not random now.

Directed.

Teams were launching in sequence, trying to walk the screaming iron across our line, searching for the place where men might cluster, searching for the panic that would create a target.

I heard the pattern.

Launch.
Scream.
Burst.

Launch again, slightly adjusted.

Hyder's men were probing with fire the way a blind man probes with a stick.

Find the soft place.

Break it.

I turned my gaze beyond the mist, searching for the one thing that mattered.

The flash.

Every rocket launch has a moment of truth.

The fuse is touched.

The powder catches.

For a heartbeat the launcher is a bright point in the grey world.

If you are trained, you can see it.

If you are disciplined, you can use it.

"There," I snapped, pointing with my crop.

The gun crew followed my gesture, eyes straining.

A brief flare in the scrub, then another.

Hendrik watched me, his face unreadable.

"Fire," I ordered.

The six-pounder spoke, the recoil slamming back into its muddy platform.

The shot tore into the scrub line where the flash had been.

For a moment I saw bodies jerk and fall.

Then smoke swallowed the detail again.

The rockets faltered.

Not stopped.

But disrupted.

That was enough.

We fired again, aiming at the next flash.

The gun became what it was meant to be.

Not a symbol.

A response.

---

On the left flank, the cavalry reached the ditch.

Horses balked at the drop and the stakes.

Men shouted, whipped, cursed.

Some horses jumped anyway, hooves slipping in wet earth.

Case shot struck them mid-leap.

Horses screamed in a way that makes men remember they are animals too.

Two riders went down into the ditch, bodies twisting, and the ditch water turned dark.

The cavalry wavered.

Then, from the northern bend, I heard a shout that carried through rain and smoke.

Caspar.

His voice was unmistakable, sharp with joy and fury at once.

"Now!" he screamed.

I could not see him, but I could see what happened next.

A small group of Travancore spearmen surged out from a covered sally point near the bend, moving fast and low. They were not many. Twelve, perhaps.

They ran straight toward the scrub where the rocket flashes had been.

It was madness.

It was also exactly what Caspar lived for.

Hendrik's face tightened.

"Recall them," he snapped.

I shook my head.

"Too late," I said.

The spearmen reached the scrub, and for a heartbeat the fight became close, ugly, and personal.

Steel rang.
Men grunted.
A matchlock fired too close and burned someone.

Then one of the rocket screams cut off mid-air.

Another did not launch.

The rocket teams were being hit at the source.

Caspar had done what we could not do with guns alone.

He had put bodies where the enemy thought only fire would go.

The spearmen fell back quickly, dragging one wounded man between them.

They disappeared behind the wall again like a wave pulled back into the sea.

The enemy infantry hesitated.

The cavalry, still tangled at the ditch, began to pull away.

The rockets stopped coming in sequence.

Now they came in desperate uneven bursts, fired too quickly, aimed too poorly.

Fear had entered the rocket crews.

That was the point.

Make the enemy feel what they wanted to make you feel.

---

The attack did not end with a dramatic retreat.

Hyder's men withdrew the way they advanced.

Disciplined.

They pulled back into the scrub, taking what wounded they could, leaving bodies where they fell.

The cavalry disengaged, riders yanking horses away from the ditch, the animals' flanks heaving.

The last rocket screamed overhead and burst in empty ground, furious and pointless.

Then there was only rain again.

And the sound of men breathing.

---

Afterwards, I walked the line with Hendrik.

Mud clung to our boots. The air smelled of powder and wet earth and blood diluted by rain.

We counted the dead.

Not many.

Not few.

Fewer than Pollilur by the order of a thousand.

Hendrik stopped at the covered position that had taken the direct rocket hit.

A gunner sat inside with his arm wrapped, face pale. The rocket fragment had cut deep into muscle, but the man was alive.

Hendrik looked at the cover, the angled wood and packed earth.

His gaze shifted to me.

For a moment I thought he would speak.

Praise would have been easy.

Hendrik did not do easy.

"It worked," he said finally.

It was not praise.

It was acknowledgement.

I nodded.

Farther down the line, Caspar stood with his spearmen, soaked and grinning, blood on his blade, his eyes bright as if he had been fed.

One of his men was wounded, cloth pressed to a thigh, teeth clenched.

Caspar looked at us as we approached.

Hendrik's face went hard.

"You disobeyed," Hendrik said.

Caspar shrugged, careless.

"I won," he replied.

Hendrik's jaw tightened.

Caspar's grin softened by a fraction.

"Your gunner taught me where to aim," he said, and he nodded toward me. "You can fire at flashes. I can stab them."

It was crude.

It was true.

Hendrik stared at him for a long moment.

Then he looked away.

"Next time," Hendrik said, voice flat, "you will tell me before you decide to be a hero."

Caspar laughed once.

"If I have time," he replied.

Hendrik did not laugh.

He kept walking.

I stood for a moment longer, looking north into the wet green world.

The Lines had been tested.

They had held.

But Hyder's men had learned something too.

They had learned where our cover worked.

They had learned we would not give them neat targets.

They would return with a new plan.

War is a conversation.

Each battle is a sentence.

That day, the wall had answered.


# Chapter 30: Refugees Again

Fear travels on bare feet.

Armies need roads and carts and powder and orders.

Fear needs only a rumour and a night without sleep.

After the Lines were tested, the refugees began to arrive.

Not in one wave.

In a steady river of bodies moving south, carrying bundles, carrying children, carrying the smell of burned grain and wet cloth.

They came with stories that sounded like prophecy because fear always wants to be believed.

---

The first group reached Udayagiri at noon, when the sun was hard and bright and the fort wall threw a sharp shadow.

They stood at the gate in a cluster, hesitant, as if afraid the wall would reject them.

There were twenty of them, perhaps thirty, mostly women and children, with two old men walking stiffly at the edge of the group. Their clothes were travel-stained, their feet cracked. One woman carried a baby wrapped in a cloth that had once been white.

The baby did not cry.

That was the first detail that made my throat tighten.

Crying takes strength.

A child who does not cry has spent its strength elsewhere.

The gate captain looked at them with a soldier's suspicion.

"Who are you?" he demanded.

One of the old men stepped forward.

"We are from the north," he said in Malayalam. His voice shook, not from age, from exhaustion. "We are farmers. We had land."

Had.

The past tense is how you know a village has died.

"Why are you here?" the captain asked.

The old man swallowed.

"Mysore," he said, and the word sounded like a sickness in his mouth. "They came. They took grain. They took boys. They burned the shed when my son argued."

His eyes dropped.

"We ran," he said. "We ran before they returned."

The captain hesitated. A fort cannot open its gate to every fear that arrives.

And yet a fort is built to hold something.

It is not only built to keep enemies out.

It is also built to keep humanity in.

I stepped forward.

"Bring them water," I ordered.

The captain looked at me, then nodded sharply and gestured to a soldier.

Water was brought.

The women drank first, quick and desperate, and then forced their children to drink even when the children were too tired to want it.

One girl looked up at me as she drank, eyes wide and flat, and I saw the expression I had seen on Dutch prisoners after Colachel.

The look of people who have learned that the world is not obligated to be kind.

---

Within days, the small group became many.

Refugees began to appear on the road in clusters, then in longer lines.

Men with bundles on their heads.
Women carrying clay pots and sleeping children.
Old people leaning on sticks, moving because staying meant death.

Some came from villages that had been raided.
Some came from towns that had been taxed into hunger.
Some came because they had heard stories and decided hunger was better than slaughter.

They carried rumours the way they carried babies.

"Hyder's men eat children."
"The rockets burn water."
"The Company is coming to take the temples."
"Travancore will close the gate."

Rumour is another kind of refugee.

It runs ahead.

It makes a country sick before the enemy arrives.

Hendrik hated them.

Not as people.

As a problem he could not solve with drill.

He stood on the wall one evening, watching a line of refugees move toward a temporary camp being set up outside the fort, and his jaw tightened.

"They will bring disease," he said.

He was not wrong.

Children coughed. Men had fevers. The smell of human waste clung to the camps because too many bodies were living too close.

But Hendrik's tone was not only fear of disease.

It was fear of disorder.

Refugees are disorder made flesh.

They are proof that walls can fail somewhere else.

Caspar came back from his northern post that week to report on the Lines, and he saw the camp.

He stared at the line of women squatting by a ditch, washing cloth that would never become clean again.

For once, he did not joke.

"This is what we are building a wall for," he said quietly.

I looked at him, surprised.

Caspar's eyes stayed on the camp.

"Not for kings," he added. "For this."

He turned away quickly, as if ashamed of the tenderness in the sentence.

---

Lakshmi went to the camp with other women from the fort households.

They brought rice.
They brought boiled water.
They brought turmeric and salt for wounds.

I went with her once, carrying a sack of dried fish.

The camp smelled of sweat and smoke and fear.

A pot bubbled over a small fire. A woman stirred it with a stick, her face blank. Children sat in the mud and stared.

An old man lay under a palm-leaf shelter, breathing shallowly, his eyes half closed. A boy fanned him with a strip of cloth as if air could drive sickness away.

Lakshmi moved through the camp with the same steady competence she brought to the fort injury room.

She did not ask who deserved help.

She helped.

That was her religion.

A woman stepped in front of her, eyes bright with panic.

"They are coming," she whispered. "They are coming behind us."

Lakshmi set down the pot she was carrying and looked the woman in the face.

"Who is coming?" she asked.

The woman swallowed.

"Mysore," she said. "Rockets. Horses. Men in blue coats. They will burn the wall. They will take the children."

The words poured out as if the woman's mouth could not stop.

Lakshmi listened without interrupting, then reached out and touched the woman's cheek lightly.

"Breathe," she said.

The woman blinked, startled by the simplicity.

"If they are coming," Lakshmi continued, voice calm, "then you will need strength. You do not find strength by drowning in your own fear."

The woman shook, then nodded, clinging to the calm as if it were rope.

Lakshmi turned to me without looking at the woman again.

"Fear is greedy," she said quietly. "It eats the living before the enemy does."

I felt my throat tighten.

She was right.

The refugees were not only bodies to feed.

They were a weapon Hyder did not have to fire.

They spread panic by existing.

---

That night, back at the fort, Hendrik called a meeting in the shed.

He spoke of supplies.
He spoke of disease control.
He spoke of how many men could be spared to guard the camps.

He spoke as if the refugees were a siege.

In a way, they were.

Not a siege of stone.

A siege of the heart.

When the meeting ended, I stood alone for a while on the wall and looked out over the campfires flickering in the dark.

Each fire was a small story.

A family that had fled.
A village that no longer existed.
A rumour that would become truth in someone's mouth by morning.

Beyond the fires, the jungle was black.

Somewhere beyond it, Hyder's army moved.

But it was not the army that filled my mind as I watched the camp.

It was the speed of fear.

Faster than scouts.
Faster than dispatches.
Faster than any wall we could build.

We had built the Lines to keep Mysore out.

The refugees had shown me that Mysore could enter without crossing a ditch.

All it needed was a story.


# Chapter 31: The Company's Price

A gun is honest.

It gives exactly what you give it. Too much powder and it bursts. Too little and it fails. You can measure it. You can predict it. You can respect it.

A ledger pretends to be honest.

It uses numbers to hide intention.

After Pollilur, the English Company's numbers began to walk into Travancore like soldiers.

---

The meeting was held in the same warehouse where I had once watched pepper sacks become ammunition.

Now the warehouse held more than pepper.

It held fear.

Raja Kesavadas stood by the scale again, his face calm, his posture controlled. His clerk waited with palm-leaf boards, ready to write whatever would become the king's obligation.

Across from him sat Mr Fraser, the Company agent, his coat dark, his handkerchief held to his nose as if pepper was still an insult.

Two Company officers stood behind him, young, clean, their faces too confident for men who had just watched a Company column burn at Pollilur.

One of them had a scar on his cheek now.

The narrow-faced lieutenant.

Caspar's handwriting in flesh.

He looked at me when I entered, eyes hard, and then looked away.

Fraser smiled as if nothing had happened.

"Dalawa," he said in Portuguese. "Difficult times."

I translated.

Kesavadas nodded.

"War," he replied. "It makes truth loud."

I translated.

Fraser's smile tightened.

---

Fraser spoke first of help.

The Company would increase powder supply.
The Company would send advisers.
The Company would share intelligence on Mysore movements.

He said each offer as if it were a gift.

Kesavadas listened as if the words were stones being weighed.

When Fraser finished, Kesavadas spoke, calm.

"The Company is generous," he said.

I translated into English as, "The Company is kind."

The same lie, repeated.

Fraser nodded, pleased.

"We do what we can," he said. "Of course, assistance requires certainty."

Certainty.

The new word for chains.

He unfolded papers and tapped a column.

"Travancore must commit to purchase Company powder exclusively," he said. "To avoid delays."

I translated.

Kesavadas did not react.

Fraser continued.

"Travancore must allow a permanent Company office at Padmanabhapuram," he said. "A small staff to facilitate coordination."

I translated.

The Brahmin priest at the edge of the room shifted, displeased. He disliked foreigners in royal air.

Fraser's voice stayed smooth.

"Travancore must permit Company troops to pass through its roads when needed," he said. "To ensure rapid response."

I translated.

Kesavadas' face stayed calm, but I saw his jaw tighten slightly.

Roads.

Once a Company army walks your roads, it begins to believe the roads belong to it.

Fraser looked at Kesavadas as if waiting for gratitude.

Then he spoke the sentence that mattered most.

"Travancore must contribute to the cost," he said.

The clerk's reed paused.

I translated.

Fraser's smile widened.

"Only fairly," he added. "A monthly subsidy. For the advisers. For the troops. For the protection."

Protection.

There it was again, the Company's favourite word for ownership.

I translated, and the Malayalam word tasted like tax.

Kesavadas leaned back slightly.

He did not say no immediately.

That was what frightened me.

Kesavadas was a man who knew the value of refusal.

If he was not refusing, it meant the numbers were doing violence.

---

Kesavadas spoke slowly.

"The Company lost a column at Pollilur," he said.

I translated.

Fraser's smile faltered for a fraction.

Kesavadas continued.

"Travancore held its Lines," he said. "Travancore held them with its own men and its own guns."

I translated.

Fraser's cheeks tightened.

Kesavadas placed his hand on the pepper scale as if grounding himself in something real.

"Why should Travancore pay for Company protection," he asked, "when Company protection could not protect Company men?"

I translated.

Silence filled the warehouse.

The Company officers behind Fraser stiffened. The lieutenant with the scar looked as if he wanted to speak, then remembered he was not allowed to.

Fraser recovered quickly.

"Pollilur was an anomaly," he said.

Anomaly.

The word meant, we will not admit that the world has changed.

Kesavadas nodded as if he accepted the word.

"Anomaly," he repeated.

Then he leaned forward.

"And the rockets?" he asked softly. "Are they also an anomaly?"

I translated.

Fraser's smile held, but it looked strained now.

"Mysore has adopted certain French tricks," he said.

Tricks.

As if innovation was a child's game.

Kesavadas' gaze stayed steady.

"Travancore will buy your powder," he said. "Travancore will listen to your intelligence. Travancore will cooperate when cooperation keeps our people alive."

I translated.

Fraser relaxed, sensing agreement.

Kesavadas continued.

"Travancore will not pay a monthly subsidy," he said. "Travancore will not accept Company troops on our roads without notice. Travancore will not allow a permanent office inside the palace precincts."

I translated, careful, smoothing the hardest edges.

Fraser's face tightened.

Kesavadas lifted one hand.

"However," he said.

Fraser's eyes gleamed.

Kesavadas spoke the word like a man choosing which finger to cut.

"Travancore will allow a Company office in the town," he said. "Outside the palace. A small staff."

I translated.

Fraser nodded, satisfied.

Kesavadas continued, voice calm.

"Travancore will allow your advisers to visit the Lines," he said. "Under escort."

I translated.

Fraser's smile widened.

Kesavadas added the final sentence.

"Travancore will pay for powder in pepper," he said. "At a fair rate. Not your rate."

I translated.

Fraser's smile tightened again.

The negotiation had ended where all negotiations end.

With compromise that feels like loss to both sides.

---

After the meeting, as Fraser gathered his papers and the clerk tied palm leaves into bundles that would become obligations, Kesavadas kept me behind.

The Company men left the warehouse with stiff politeness, their boots careful not to step in pepper dust as if dirt could stain empire.

When the last red wax seal vanished, Kesavadas looked at me.

"You see it," he said, eyes hard.

I nodded.

"They cannot beat Mysore alone," I said quietly. "So they will beat paper instead."

Kesavadas' mouth tightened.

"They will beat us with paper until we thank them for it," he said.

He gestured toward the pepper sacks.

"Every barrel of powder has a price," he continued. "Not in silver. In leverage."

He looked at me, eyes hard.

"You served a Company once," he said. "Tell me this. When a Company offers help, what does it want?"

The question was another test.

I answered with the only honesty that mattered.

"It wants to be needed," I said. "And once it is needed, it wants to be obeyed."

Kesavadas nodded.

"Good," he said. "Then do not let your fort become dependent."

I wanted to laugh.

Powder comes from elsewhere. Lead comes from elsewhere. Saltpetre comes from elsewhere.

Dependency is built into war.

But Kesavadas' point was clear.

Do not let the Company become the only door.

Do not let a wall become a chain.

---

On the ride back to Udayagiri, I passed the refugee camp again.

Children played in mud.
Women cooked rice in dented pots.
Men sat staring north as if their eyes could stop an army.

Fear had made them homeless.

Now paper was about to make the kingdom beholden.

At the fort, Hendrik was drilling gunners.

The rhythm of sponge and ram filled the yard, steady, familiar.

It would have comforted me once.

Now I saw the other rhythm underneath it.

Pepper weighed.
Powder bought.
Obligations written.

The paper was growing heavier than the gun.

And it did not even pretend to be honest.

# Chapter 32: The Tiger Dies

Men had begun calling Hyder Ali the Tiger long before he died.

It was not a title he chose.

It was a name the world gave him because it needed a shape for its fear.

Tigers move unseen until they do not.

They kill without apology.

They make villages go quiet.

Hyder had done that to kingdoms.

So when the news came in 1782 that the Tiger was dead, men in Travancore reacted the way men always react when a predator falls.

They cheered.

They laughed.

They breathed as if the air had become lighter.

The relief lasted one breath.

---

The courier arrived at Udayagiri at dusk, his horse lame, his own face drawn.

He carried a dispatch from Padmanabhapuram, sealed with the Dalawa's mark.

Hendrik took it, broke it open, and read.

His eyebrows lifted slightly.

That was all.

Then he looked at me and held the paper out.

The message was brief.

Hyder Ali dead.
Illness.
Mysore leadership uncertain.
Stay alert.

I read it twice, as if reading twice could produce a different meaning.

Caspar was in the yard, just returned from the Lines, mud on his boots, eyes bright.

"What is it?" he demanded.

Hendrik said it aloud.

Hyder Ali is dead.

The words moved through the fort like wind.

Gunners shouted.
Spearmen grinned.
Men slapped each other's backs.

Even the refugees outside the wall heard and began to murmur, the sound rising into something like prayer.

Death, for a moment, felt like hope.

Caspar laughed, a full sound.

"Finally," he said. "Finally the beast bleeds."

Hendrik did not smile.

He looked at the paper again as if trying to see what was not written.

I felt something cold in my chest.

Not because I mourned Hyder.

Because I had learned, the hard way, that men who build systems do not die with their bodies.

Their systems remain.

---

That night, Hendrik called the officers into the shed.

He spoke of patrols.
He spoke of watch rotations.
He spoke of supplies.

He refused to let celebration loosen discipline.

Some men resented it. Some obeyed.

Caspar stood by the door, arms folded, bored again now that the moment of excitement had passed.

"You are afraid of joy," Caspar muttered to me in Dutch.

"I am afraid of tomorrow," I replied.

Caspar snorted.

"Tomorrow is always coming," he said. "We cannot fight it."

He turned away as if the conversation had finished.

I looked at Hendrik as he spoke, and for a moment I saw De Lannoy in him.

Not the warmth.

The stubborn refusal to let emotion become weakness.

When the meeting ended, Hendrik dismissed the officers and kept me back.

He waited until the shed was empty, then spoke in a low voice.

"Tipu," he said.

The name was not in the dispatch.

It did not need to be.

Hyder's son had already been a presence in our minds, a shadow behind the Tiger.

I nodded slowly.

"He was at Pollilur," I said.

Hendrik's jaw tightened.

"Yes," he replied.

We stood in silence, both seeing the same image.

Raman's burned face.
The square becoming fire.
Rockets in the sky.

Tipu had not been a rumour in that battle.

He had been the hand lighting the fuse.

"Hyder was a soldier," I said quietly. "He wanted power."

Hendrik looked at me.

"And Tipu?" he asked.

I hesitated.

It is dangerous to speak certainty about a man you have not met.

But I had read reports. I had heard stories. I had listened to refugees who spoke of Mysore with the particular fear reserved for zeal.

"Tipu wants more than power," I said. "He wants a world remade."

Hendrik's face stayed still.

"Then the Tiger is not dead," he said.

He looked toward the wall.

"It has only changed its skin."

---

Later, when the fort quieted and the last shouts of celebration faded, I climbed the parapet alone.

The sky was clear for once, the stars sharp. The jungle beyond the Lines was a black mass.

Somewhere inside it, beyond sight, Mysore's camps would still burn with cooking fires. Men would still drill. Rocket tubes would still be cleaned and packed. Officers would still shout orders.

News of Hyder's death would reach them too.

They would mourn, perhaps.

Or they would not.

Machines do not mourn.

They adjust.

Below me, in the fort yard, a gunner laughed softly in his sleep, dreaming of peace.

I thought of Lakshmi and the children, safe behind walls that existed only because men kept working.

I thought of De Lannoy in the ground behind the chapel, his last instructions still fresh in my mind.

Keep the magazine dry.
Pay the men.
Do not trust the Company.

Simple.

And still not enough.

I stood on the wall and looked north.

For a moment I let myself feel the relief the others had felt.

Hyder dead.

Then I exhaled, and the relief vanished.

Because relief is a luxury.

And Tipu was alive.

# Epilogue: The Torch Passes

I write this in my late fifties with hands that are not as steady as they were.

Age does not announce itself with one dramatic failure. It arrives as small betrayals. A finger that cramps while holding a pen. An eye that waters when lamp smoke drifts wrong. A breath that comes shorter after climbing the wall steps.

I used to believe only bodies aged.

Now I know ideas age too.

The idea that European drill is invincible.
The idea that walls are permanent.
The idea that a Company can be satisfied with profit.

Hyder Ali is dead, and men tell themselves the war has ended.

I have learned not to trust men when they comfort themselves.

Tipu is alive.

The Lines are unfinished.

The Company smiles.

And the world keeps changing whether we ask it to or not.

---

When I began to write, I thought I was writing for myself.

A man puts words on paper because he wants to hold something steady while everything around him moves.

But the longer I write, the more I understand I am writing for people I will never meet.

For my son, Willem, who will inherit my face and my accent and my failure to belong cleanly anywhere.

For my daughter, Anna, who will marry into a family that will look at her and see questions.

For my youngest, Thomas, who still believes walls exist because they are meant to.

And perhaps for men not of my blood at all.

Men who will come after.

Men who will carry the work and the cost.

Travancore has always taken outsiders and used them.

Sometimes it remakes them.

Sometimes it breaks them.

---

Years ago, a report crossed my desk in Udayagiri.

It was a small thing, almost an aside in a dispatch about troop movements and supply routes.

An old cavalry commander in the south, Ananthan Pillai, had taken in a Maratha fugitive.

The name Ananthan Pillai meant little to most men in the fort. But I knew the story, because De Lannoy had told it to me once.

Ananthan Pillai had been born Nagoji Sawant.

A Maratha. A prisoner from the old wars. A man who had been captured and should have died, but who had been remade instead. He had married a local woman, taken a new name, served kings who were not his by birth.

He was what Travancore made of men it chose to keep.

The report said the man had a brand on his forehead.

Not a decorative mark.

A punishment burned into flesh.

The words on the brand were clear enough that even a foreign gunner like me could understand their weight.

Brahmin-killer.

Temple robber.

Murderer.

The report said the fugitive worked in stables at first.

The report said Ananthan's wife insisted on keeping him, against counsel, against prudence, against every rule that makes a kingdom feel safe.

I read the paragraph twice and then set the paper down.

Travancore swallowing another outsider.

Travancore making another enemy into a tool.

Travancore, endlessly hungry for men who can be used.

I did not think of it again for years.

Then, not long ago, a dispatch from the northern marches mentioned the name again.

Bhalerao.

The branded one.

Not a stable hand any longer.

Not a fugitive.

A man on horseback with blood on his hands and purpose in his eyes, if the messenger's words were true.

I held the paper in my hands and felt a strange sensation I did not have a word for.

Not hope.

Not fear.

Recognition.

Travancore was doing what it had always done.

Taking wreckage and asking it to become a wall.

---

When I was sixteen, I was taken at Colachel and thought my life had ended.

Then De Lannoy pointed at me and said, learn, and live.

He did not offer comfort.

He offered work.

Work made me into something else.

Not Dutch.
Not Travancorean.

A gunner.

Perhaps it will make Bhalerao into something else too.

Not forgiven.
Not absolved.

But useful.

Sometimes usefulness is the only redemption a kingdom can offer.

I do not know what kind of man Bhalerao will become.

I do not know whether he will survive Tipu.

I know only that the wall needs men, and men are always arriving, broken in different ways, carrying different ghosts.

---

I will not live to see the end of this story.

I have accepted that.

A man does what he can in the time he is given. He maintains walls. He trains gunners. He keeps faith with the memory of those who taught him.

Then he passes the work to whoever comes next.

Travancore takes what it needs.

It took De Lannoy, who came as a conqueror and died as a builder.

It took Nagoji Sawant, who came as a prisoner and became a legend.

It took me, who came as a boy full of Lutheran hate and became a man who no longer knows how to pray but still knows how to aim.

Perhaps it will take Bhalerao too.

The wheel turns.

The story goes on.

One outsider to another.

One transformation to another.

I am writing this because someone should. Because the work does not stop when the worker dies. Because a wall is not built by one man or one generation but by all the hands that touch the stone.

The torch passes.

Not in ceremony.

In necessity.

And somewhere in the south, a young man with a brand on his forehead is learning what I learned forty years ago.

That survival is not forgiveness.

That work is not redemption.

But that both are better than the alternative.

Travancore endures.

The rest is detail.
