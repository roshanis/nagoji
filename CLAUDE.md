# Assistant Notes

This repository is a book manuscript, not an application codebase. For full writing and editing guidance, read `AGENTS.md`.

## Constraints

- No em dashes.
- Keep chapter files self-contained; do not split or merge them.
- Maintain a clear POV and timeline; avoid anachronistic language.

## Files To Keep In Sync

- `book*_chapter*.md`: primary narrative chapters
- `manuscript_v2.md`: composite draft (chapters plus end matter)
- `synopsys.md`, `novel_outline_bhimrao.md`, `glossary.md`, `Author_Historical_Note_nagoji.md`: support documents that should reflect the current manuscript
