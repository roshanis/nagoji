# Book I, Chapter 5: Road to Travancore

The man they called *kapitan* introduced himself as Ibrahim.

Not with a bow or a flourish, only with a nod and a measuring look that told me he had decided what kind of man I was before he opened his mouth.

"You were on the Portuguese ship," he said in Konkani, the trade tongue one of the fishermen had used to speak with me. "The storm did not like her."

“The storm did not like any of us,” I said. My voice had grown stronger after a day of rest, rice gruel and herbs that burned my throat but soothed my chest. “I took the chance it gave.”

He glanced at my branded arm, at the bandaged hands, at the rope burns.

“You are Maratha.”

“Yes.”

“You fought them.”

“Yes.”

He nodded, his thumb tracing the scar on his jaw, a habit, I would learn, that meant he was filing information away.

"Our king fights them too," he said. "And their cousins, the Dutch. He will want to hear what you have seen."

He paused, his thumb tracing the scar again. Something flickered behind his eyes, a calculation, a road not taken. Then it was gone.

He did not say which king. On this coast there were many rulers, small and large, each jealous of their titles. The fishermen had spoken the name Travancore, but I wanted to hear it from this man's mouth.

“Who is your king?” I asked.

Ibrahim's lips twitched.

“You will learn his names and his titles in good time,” he said. “For now, think of him as the man whose land you lie on, whose boats pull the pepper your people crave, and whose patience with Europeans is thin.”

He gestured to the woman who had tended my wounds.

“Can he travel?”

She snorted.

“He should rest another week, but you will not wait. Men like you never do.”

“Men like me are paid to be impatient,” he said mildly. To me he added, “Can you sit a cart, or a horse?”

At the word horse an ache went through me that had nothing to do with broken skin.

“I can sit,” I said. “I can walk, if there is no better way.”

“There is a better way, though you will not like it,” Ibrahim said. “Come.”

They did not give me back my old clothes. Those were beyond saving. Instead the village turned out a set of cotton dhoti and a simple shirt that smelled faintly of coconut smoke. The cloth felt strange after months of coarse prison rags and damp. My branded arm was hidden now. My hands, wrapped in clean strips of linen, throbbed less.

Outside, the village had returned to its habits. Women drew water from a well. Children chased each other with shrieks of laughter. Men patched nets in the shade of leaning palms. Only the occasional glance at the path toward the sea betrayed the fact that a Portuguese ship had broken nearby.

Ibrahim led me not to the shore, but inland, along a narrow track that wound between paddy fields. The water in the flooded plots reflected the darkening sky in strips. Frogs chirped. A faint breeze carried the smell of wet earth and something else, sharp and almost floral.

"Pepper," Ibrahim said when he saw my nose twitch. "You will come to know that smell well if you stay on this coast. It sits in the lungs. It pays for guns."

I breathed it in. On the Deccan we had fought for the routes that carried this smell north. Now I was at the source.

"And for kings," Ibrahim added. "That too."

We reached a small clearing where a pair of bullocks stood hitched to a cart. The cart's bed was lined with sacks. Some held rice, others the dried, wrinkled berries that gave the air its sting.

"We send word ahead," Ibrahim said. "Our people are the vines that run along this coast. We carry news as well as goods. When we bring you to the king's men, they will already know more about you than you think."

"What do you tell them?"

He shrugged, but the gesture was a little too careful.

"That I found a branded Maratha officer on our beach after a Portuguese ship broke. That he still has both eyes and more teeth than one would expect from the Viceroy's dungeons. That he speaks like a man who has led horse into gunfire and lived." He glanced at me sideways. "A man like that has value. The question is always to whom."

The cart jolted as he climbed up. He offered me a hand. I took it and hauled myself onto the sacks, biting back a groan as my bruised ribs protested.

“Rest,” he said. “The road is long, and the bulls do not hurry.”

He was right about the bulls. They moved with the slow, patient gait of creatures that had never been asked to do anything quickly. The cart creaked along narrow paths that gradually turned into a broader road. Above us the sky shifted from bruised grey to the deep blue of evening. Fireflies sparked in the wet fields. Somewhere a temple bell rang, a soft, clear sound that seemed to hang in the thick air.

“Your people,” Ibrahim said after a time, “what do they think of this coast?”

“They think of it when they want money,” I said. “Pepper, cloth, horses from beyond the sea. Men from the north fight for these things, but our hills do not grow them. We have learned to ride down toward the ports, strike at caravans and warehouses, ride back before your masters answer.”

“Your masters,” he repeated. “Not you.”

“I serve, as all men serve,” I said. “But I know the difference between a fort built to defend a people and a fort built to protect a treasury.”

He considered that.

“Our fortresses are both,” he said. “You will see.”

We passed through small settlements where people spoke Malayalam I could not follow. Ibrahim greeted men by name, asked after catches and prices, then translated the essentials into Konkani for me. In one village a group of boys ran alongside the cart for a while, pointing at me.

“Who is he?” one of them called out.

“A man who thought he could drown, then changed his mind,” Ibrahim replied. The boys laughed, then peeled off, already drawn by some new distraction.

As the road climbed slightly, the line of coconut palms thinned. In their place rose other trees, taller and denser, their leaves a darker green. The air grew heavier, as if the forest held the day's heat in its branches.

“Beyond these hills,” Ibrahim said, “the land belongs to men who answer only to the king. They do not like uninvited guests. If you were walking alone, they would have misdirected you until you found yourself back at the sea with fewer coins and perhaps fewer fingers.”

“And with you?”

“With me you are still an uninvited guest,” he said, “but one whose arrival has been announced.”

We stopped near a wayside shrine where a stone image sat under a tree draped with cloth and bangles. An old woman tended a little lamp before it. Ibrahim stepped down, offered a coin and a nod. The woman blessed him with a smear of ash on his forehead, then looked past him at me.

"That one carries storms in his bones," she said in Malayalam. Ibrahim translated, then replied in the same tongue. When I raised an eyebrow, he shrugged.

"I told her you carry horses there too. Storms and horses can both be useful, if you know how to ride them."

As evening deepened, we reached a larger settlement. It was not quite a town, not yet, but bigger than the fishing village. Houses stood closer together. A small bazaar clustered around a crossroads, stalls offering spices, cloth, oil, and trinkets. The road here was better packed, the wheel ruts deeper.

Near the centre stood a compound wall of red stone blocks. A wooden gate broke its length. Two men with spears lounged there, straightening when they saw Ibrahim.

“You come late, *kapitan*,” one of them said.

“The sea does not consult my schedule,” Ibrahim said. He jerked his chin toward me. “This is the man I sent word about.”

The guard peered at me, his gaze lingering on my hands and the line of my shoulders.

“He looks like he should already be dead.”

“He disagrees,” Ibrahim said. “Our king might too.”

They let us through.

Inside the compound a low hall stood, its wooden pillars carved with curling designs. Lamps hung from chains, casting soft light on the packed earth floor. Men sat cross legged around a central space where a mat had been laid. At the far end, on a slightly raised platform, another man sat with a ledger and a pile of palm leaf bundles.

He wore no crown, only a simple dhoti and a shawl over one shoulder. Yet the way others watched him made it clear he was the one who mattered here.

"This is not the king," Ibrahim murmured as we approached. "He is busy elsewhere. This is one of his hands on this coast."

The man looked up.

"You bring me shipwreck," he said in Malayalam. Ibrahim translated, but the dry amusement in the official's tone needed no translation.

“The sea brought him,” Ibrahim said. “I only stopped the crabs from finishing.”

The man's eyes moved to me.

“Name,” he said. Ibrahim translated the harsh Malayalam syllable for me.

“Nagoji Sawant.”

“Service?”

“Huzurat cavalry,” I said. “Household horse under Chimaji Appa. Until the Portuguese netted me.”

His eyes flicked to my bandaged hands, the brand under my sleeve. "You raided them?"

“Yes.”

“You know their forts?”

“Some.”

He tapped the edge of his ledger with the end of his writing stylus.

“Our king sharpens his sword for the Dutch now,” he said, waiting for Ibrahim to echo the words in Konkani. “And for those local chiefs who think they can hide behind European flags. He has horse from Arcot, musketeers of his own, ships that slip between the foreign hulls at night. What does a Maratha rider know that he does not already have?”

There it was. The question that would decide whether I was given a place in this new game or quietly dropped into some ditch.

“Your king knows his own land,” I said to Ibrahim, watching the official's face. “He knows these hills, these backwaters, which chiefs will bend and which must be broken. The Dutch and the Portuguese know their books and their drills. I know how men like them think when they stand on foreign soil and believe God and powder have made them superior. I know what a horse can do to a musket line when the man in the saddle has stopped being impressed by white skin.”

Silence settled over the hall for a moment.

Then the man on the platform smiled, very slightly.

“You speak well for someone who almost fed the fish,” he said, the translation arriving a moment after the amusement in his eyes. “Rest tonight. Tomorrow we take you to the king's war hall. He can decide whether your words are as sharp as you think.”

I bowed my head. Not as a subject, not yet, but as a man who understands that some battles begin with a lowered gaze and a measured tone.

Outside, night had fallen. The air was thick and warm. Somewhere in the darkness pepper vines climbed up their supports, indifferent to the schemes of men. Somewhere to the south a king I had not yet met considered maps covered in salt stains and ink.

The road that had begun in a Goan dungeon now pointed toward him.

Horses. Guns. Storms.

Sleep came slowly that night, but when it did, it carried no dreams of drowning. Only the steady beat of hooves on sand, and a distant roar like the sea.
