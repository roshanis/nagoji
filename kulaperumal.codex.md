# Kulasekhara Perumal: Comparison Notes (Codex)

**Reference read**: `The_Kulasekhara_Perumals_Refactored.epub` (1997; Leiden CNWS)

These are working notes comparing the reference EPUB against our Books 1 to 3 and tracking what the manuscript needs to align on names, places, dates, and storyline.

## Names and Titles to Standardise

*   **Eustachius De Lannoy**: Born in **Arras** (29 December 1715). Deserted the VOC from **Kanyakumari** (2 August 1741). Served Travancore as **Venattu Kappittan** (Captain of Venad) and was known as **Valiya Kappittan** (Great Captain). Died at Udayagiri (1 June 1777).
*   **Joannes Eustachius Benedictus de Lannoy**: De Lannoy’s son, killed at **Kalakad** (14 September 1765), described as barely twenty. Known as **Cheriya Kappittan** (Small Captain).
*   **Gustaaf Willem Baron van Imhoff**: Dutch Governor of Sri Lanka (Ceylon), key diplomatic antagonist; his February 1739 visit and the gold insult help trigger the Travancore war.
*   **Julius Valentijn Stein van Gollenesse**: VOC commander at Kochi (Cochin); central figure for the Dutch side of the Colachel campaign (optional to name on-page, but useful historical texture).
*   **Successor chain after De Lannoy (use for continuity)**: Pierre Fleury (d. 16 March 1780), then Joseph Donnadi.

## Places and Geography to Keep Consistent

*   **Colachel**: Dutch landing point and siege theatre.
*   **Kanyakumari**: Key staging point; De Lannoy’s desertion point in the reference.
*   **Kollam (Quilon)**: Core node for the Desinganadu polity.
*   **Desinganadu**: Principality centred on Kollam (Quilon), repeatedly entangled with Dutch policy.
*   **Tengapattanam**: Site of the late-night Van Imhoff meeting in February 1739.
*   **Aramboli pass and Aramboli Lines**: Southern defensive works, important as evidence of pre-war state-building.
*   **Nedumkotta / Travancore Lines**: Northern wall system (started 1761) with a deep ditch, bastions, and camps, built to resist Mysore.

## Dates and Anchors (What the Reference Fixes in Place)

*   **Colachel sequence**: 26 Nov 1740 bombardment; 19 Feb 1741 landing; 27 May 1741 Tiruvattar prayer visit; 2 Aug 1741 desertion; about 10 Aug decisive battle; 12 Aug capitulation; 13 Aug march out.
*   **Van Imhoff catalyst**: late Jan to early March 1739 travel and intimidation tour; gold demand linked to *hiranyagarbha* and the Kulasekhara Perumal claim.
*   **Treaties and turning points**: Thrippadidanam (Jan 1750); Second Treaty of Mavelikara (Aug 1753).
*   **Travancore Lines**: construction started 1761; about 56 km; ditch about 6 m deep and 5 m wide; around 20 bastions; camps and wells about every 3 km.

## Storyline Fixes for Our Manuscripts (Books 1 to 3)

### Book 1 (Horse of the Servant)

*   **De Lannoy must be a deserter, not a captive**: Reference is explicit that he crossed lines before the decisive battle and then helped negotiate surrender.
*   **Colachel must feel multi-day**: Battle, capitulation, and march-out are distinct beats, not a single overnight turn.
*   **Tiruvattar timing**: The May visit is a pre-siege prayer, not only a post-victory thanksgiving. If we want both, we need two visits.
*   **Van Imhoff and the gold insult**: The reference frames the war as politics plus pepper. The insult is not merely rude; it is strategic sabotage of a king trying to secure temple legitimacy and a larger sovereign claim.
*   **Aramboli Lines**: Include as proof that Travancore is already building defensive infrastructure before the Dutch war.

### Book 2 (The Dutchman’s Son)

*   **Chapel as grief made stone**: The Udayagiri chapel is built after Joannes dies; it deepens De Lannoy beyond “European reformer”.
*   **Dates**: Mavelikara (1753), Thrippadidanam (1750), De Lannoy death (1 June 1777) should be anchored cleanly.
*   **Titles**: Venattu Kappittan, Valiya Kappittan, Cheriya Kappittan should be treated as living terms in the fort, not only glossary labels.

### Book 3 (Tiger’s Heir)

*   **Nedumkotta specificity**: The reference gives concrete numbers that help the wall feel real on the page (length, ditch dimensions, bastions, spacing of camps).
*   **Siege duration**: Tipu’s pressure is prolonged, not a single clean strike.

## Spellings and Terms to Standardise Everywhere

*   **Chaver** (not Chevar)
*   **Desinganadu** (not Deshinganad or Desinganad)
*   **Donnadi** (not Donadi)
*   **Valiya Kappittan** (not Valia Kappithan)

## Status (What Has Been Applied)

*   Book 1: Colachel continuity fixes; Van Imhoff insult and Aramboli Lines context; De Lannoy desertion framing; multi-day capitulation; terminology standardisation.
*   Book 2: Arras origin, Mavelikara and Thrippadidanam anchors; Joannes and chapel context; death date anchor.
*   Book 3: Nedumkotta specs and siege-duration cue.
*   Shared: glossary updates and spelling standardisation; historical note aligned with desertion framing.
