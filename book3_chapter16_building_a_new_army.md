# Book III, Chapter 16: Building a New Army

Time after a battle does not move in days. It moves in drills.

You look up one morning and realise that the men who had never seen a European volley a season ago now curse when a recruit fumbles his priming. You notice that the boys in the kalari have grown into broad shouldered youths who no longer look over their shoulders for approval before they strike. You find grey at your temples that you do not remember earning.

That was how I measured the years after Colachel.

In drills. In walls. In the sound of muskets fired in rhythm on fields where once only temple drums echoed.

Lannoy chose to stay.

At sunrise, the morning after his interrogation, he came before the king again. His hands were unbound this time, though guards still stood near.

“I will serve,” he said in Portuguese, voice flat but clear. “Under your conditions.”

Marthanda Varma inclined his head slowly.

“Then you are no longer a prisoner,” he said. “You are an officer. We will see what kind.”

From that day, the work changed.

Walls that had been patched with whatever stone was at hand were stripped and rebuilt according to new designs. Bastions took on an angular, European look, jutting out like clenched fists. Firing steps were cut with careful calculations of height and angle. Old cannons were remounted, new ones cast or bought.

The first time I climbed one of those finished walls and looked down, my stomach did a small, unfamiliar twist. Deccan forts I had grown up with were proud, vertical things. They rose from crags like stacked fists, their lines clean, their corners square, their strength drawn as much from the hill beneath as from the stone above. You could ride up to such a fort, look at it, and know where its teeth sat and where its blind spots lay. Lannoy's designs were different. From above, the fort no longer looked like a box or a ring. It looked like a jagged flower or a star, each bastion thrust out at an angle so that every length of wall could be watched and raked by fire from another. There were no safe shadows at the base now, no stretch of stone that did not lie under some slit or parapet. Even the height felt strange. The walls were lower and thicker than the tall, showy ramparts of my childhood, built not to impress riders like me, but to swallow cannon shot and spit it aside.

Lannoy walked those walls with the same restrained intensity he had once given to Dutch decks. He sketched on palm leaves and bits of paper, muttering to himself, then turned to Travancore masons and carpenters and explained with gestures when words failed.

“If you make this parapet straight, a cannonball that hits it will punch through,” he said once, tapping a line in the clay. “If you slope it, the ball glances off. You save stone. You save men.”

The mason, a squat man with arms like tree trunks, squinted at the sketch, then at the old wall.

“Angled seems more difficult,” he said. “Stone likes to sit square.”

“So do men,” Lannoy replied. “We will teach them both new habits.”

He did not work alone.

I found myself increasingly at his side, not because we liked each other, but because Ramayyan liked the results when we were forced to share space.

In the mornings, Lannoy drilled musketeers and cannon crews.

“Again,” he would say, not raising his voice, but sharpening it. “Prime, load, aim, fire. Faster. Together. The ball does not care whose fingers poured the powder if the timing is wrong.”

He taught them to aim low, to fire not at banners or faces, but at belts, where a shot might tear through more than one man. He taught them to conserve powder in the wet season, to keep their matchcord dry, to clean their barrels with care.

In the afternoons, I drilled horse.

“Again,” I would say, sometimes in the same tone without meaning to. “Circle, feint, scatter, reform. Feel the sand. Trust the man at your side to see the gap you missed.”

I taught them to ride not as independent heroes, but as parts of a moving shape. I taught them that the first volley is not the end of the world, that horses can be taught not to bolt at the sound of muskets if handled calmly.

Sometimes our drills overlapped.

On those days, Lannoy and I stood together on the edge of the training ground, watching as musketeers fired and horse swept across their front at calculated distances.

“In Flanders, we would never expose our men like this,” he said once, shaking his head as a line of Travancore infantry fired over the heads of a passing cavalry unit. “Too much risk of friendly fire.”

“In Flanders, you fight on flat ground,” I said. “Here, your men will have Nairs screaming in their ears and sand in their teeth. Better they learn now how to keep their hands steady when hooves thunder near.”

He made a noncommittal sound, then adjusted a recruit's stance with a quick touch.

“Thumb here,” he said in broken Malayalam. “If you put it there, the recoil will break it. Then you cannot pull the trigger again.”

The recruit winced, nodded, corrected himself.

We argued often.

“Your cavalry should form in deeper blocks,” he said one day, tracing rectangles with his boot in the dust. “Two or three ranks. Their weight will punch through any line.”

“And present a thicker target for Dutch cannon,” I replied. “Our horses are not war machines that regenerate overnight. We cannot afford to lose them in piles for the satisfaction of seeing one dramatic impact.”

“Shock matters,” he insisted.

“So does survival,” I said. “These men have fields to return to when the wet season comes. If you burn them all in one summer, who will plant your pepper”

He glared, then sighed.

“You are stubborn,” he said.

“You are surprised” I asked.

He laughed, short and sharp.

“No,” he said. “You are a horseman. I would worry if you were not.”

The men watched these exchanges with a mixture of amusement and wariness.

For them, we represented two very different kinds of foreignness.

I was the Deccan outsider, with my Maratha tongue and my stories of forts in dry hills. Lannoy was the pale haired European, with his long nose and his talk of places with names like Zeeland and Flanders. We both spoke with the king's backing. We both shouted at them when drills went badly. We both bled with them when things went wrong.

Ramayyan hovered at the edge of our shared work, occasionally stepping in to smooth a quarrel, more often simply watching.

“You pull in different directions,” he said once, when Lannoy and I had nearly come to blows over the placement of a new redoubt. “Good. That keeps the fort from rolling down the hill in one piece.”

“We could build two forts,” I muttered. “One for each of us.”

“We cannot feed two,” he replied. “Learn to share walls.”

The king did not attend every drill. He did not need to. His presence was felt anyway.

When he did appear, he watched quietly, saying little. A slight tightening of his jaw at a sloppy volley, a small nod at a clean charge, a brief word to a captain whose unit had improved, all of these carried more weight than a dozen shouted orders.

He also rode out to inspect the new forts that rose along the northern marches.

“We will not wait for the Dutch to bring their friends here,” he said, standing on a newly built bastion overlooking a narrow pass. “We have other enemies in this land. The Mysore men. The old chiefs who resent my line. The Marathas, if they decide to ride south. This army is not only for white men.”

His gaze slid to me when he said “Marathas”.

“If your Peshwa comes,” he said, “I want him to find more than pepper and prayers waiting.”

“He will find a man he once chained working your walls,” I said.

“Then he will know I am not wasteful,” the king replied.

Travancore's shape changed under this work.

Villages that had once sent men only when summoned now saw their sons marching in regular drills on designated days. Chiefs who had kept small private bands of fighters began to send those men to be integrated into company sized units under the king's officers. The old, loose patchwork of levies and personal retainers slowly rewove itself into something tighter.

Not everyone liked it.

In some houses, older men grumbled that the Maharaja was taking their traditional rights. In others, younger men welcomed the chance to rise through a system that recognised skill more than birth.

Padmini Amma navigated these shifts with her usual blend of sharp tongue and practical adjustment.

“You will send ten men to the new fort,” she told one reluctant kinsman. “You will also send grain. In return, when raiders come from the north, those cannons will not ask whether your house paid its proper share before they fire. This is how a kingdom works, cousin. Not like your grandfather's time.”

Revathi watched with a more complicated gaze.

At Velinadu, she attended some of the new musters, her eyes following the lines of men, the shapes of formations, the flags that flew above them.

“Your king buys loyalty with guns,” she said to me once as we watched a mixed unit of Nair and Arcot infantry fire in turn. “It is an expensive currency. When the guns rust, what will hold them?”

“Habit,” I said. “Fear. Pride.”

“Habit breaks,” she said. “Fear changes its object. Pride is a fire that burns houses as easily as enemy camps.”

She was not wrong.

But as I watched a line of young recruits bring their muskets to their shoulders in a smooth movement that would have been unthinkable three years earlier, I could not deny the power of what we were building.

A state that could kill Europeans.

A state that could, in time, kill men who looked like me, if the map shifted.

In quieter moments, alone under the jackfruit tree or on the fort wall at dusk, I thought of my village near Nashik.

Of my brother walking the fields. Of my parents' hair turning white. Of Deccan forts that may or may not have heard of a small southern battle called Colachel.

“You could go back,” Kulkarni said one evening as we watched Lannoy's men practice loading drills by lamplight. “You have earned the right. The king would not stop you. He might even send a letter to your Peshwa saying you fought well.”

“And then what?” I asked. “I arrive as a man who has seen how a small kingdom built for war thinks. They will either treat me as a curiosity or try to use me against this land. Either way, I will find myself in another man's web. At least here I know the strands.”

He grunted.

“You speak as if you are resigned,” he said.

“I speak as if I have counted,” I replied. “And found fewer deaths in this column than in the others.”

He laughed, shaking his head.

“Always counting,” he said.

“It is what I know how to do,” I said.

One evening, after a long day of drills, Lannoy and I found ourselves standing alone on a bastion above the inlet where Marakkar boats moved like dark insects.

For a time we said nothing. The sky was the colour of old pewter, the water below catching and breaking what little light remained.

“When I was a boy,” he said suddenly, without preamble, “I dreamed of building fortresses on foreign shores. In school we drew maps and imagined walls that would project our power into strange lands. It was all lines and angles. None of us drew the people who would live behind those walls.”

He gestured toward the fort under our feet.

“Now I build them for a king who once tried to kill me,” he said. “Life has a sense of humour.”

“You are paid,” I said.

“So are carpenters,” he replied. “They do not always get to choose which houses their beams hold up.”

He looked at me.

“My mother writes that the company priests tell her to pray for my soul,” he added quietly. “She lights candles for a son who is either dead or damned, depending on which story they tell that week. I do not know which pains her less.”

The admission hung between us, more intimate than any talk of angles.

“Do you ever regret staying?” he asked.

I thought of Goa. Of the storm. Of Keshavrao's hand slipping from the rope. Of the first time Marthanda Varma offered me a place.

“Regret” I said. “No. Question, yes. Often.”

“That is something,” he said.

A few weeks later, at Udayagiri, someone tried to answer those questions for us.

We were walking the new rampart line there at dusk, arguing over whether a particular angle gave enough overlapping fire, when a musket cracked from the scrub beyond the outer ditch. The sound came with the flat, hard snap of powder close to hand, not the distant thud of a practice shot.

The ball sang past Lannoy's head, close enough that I heard it clip a loose strand of his hair. Another shot followed a heartbeat later, then a third, both low and hurried. Stone chipped from the parapet near my knee.

“Down,” I snarled, dragging him with me behind the bastion's lip.

Below, our sentries shouted and scattered, muskets snatched up, eyes searching the scrub and rocky outcrops beyond the ditch. Dogs barked. A whistle blew. Somewhere in the gathering dark, feet pounded briefly, then faded.

By the time a search party reached the far bank, whoever had fired was gone. They found only three spent cartridges, trampled grass and the faint, sour smell of someone who had sweated fear and anger in equal measure.

“Not our men,” Ramayyan said later, when reports came in. “Our guards do not waste powder taking potshots at their own fort. Dutch agents, perhaps. Or some Cochin fool who thinks that if De Lannoy dies, the company will pat his head. It pleases me that they aimed badly. It troubles me that they aimed at all.”

Lannoy had gone very still when the first ball passed his ear. Afterward, in the lamplight of the guardroom, he looked at the chipped stone on the parapet and said only, “They will try again, in other ways.”

For me, the musket marks at Udayagiri became one more line in the ledger of storms we now lived under. Not all of them came from the sea.

For a little while, another thought gnawed at me.

Revathi had spoken more than once of how dangerous it was to let a foreign officer build teeth into this coast, how easy it would be, if a wall ever fell, to let it land on the man who had drawn its lines. Velinadu had eyes and ears in more places than I could count. It would not have been hard for someone who shared her hatred of European arrogance to whisper a path to a hired musket.

The idea tasted wrong even as it formed. She had never been a woman who hid behind bush and ditch. If she wanted De Lannoy humbled or gone, she would say it in a hall where everyone could hear, not send a nervous shooter to scratch stone at his ear. I held on to that, the way a man in a storm holds on to one known star. Love is a poor shield against suspicion, but it is more stubborn than fear.

Below, a cannon boomed, part of a test. The sound rolled out over the water, startling birds from the trees.

“They will come back,” Lannoy said softly. “My old masters. In some form. They do not like being told no.”

“Then we will have walls ready for them,” I said.

He nodded.

“And guns,” he added. “And horse. And men who know how to move on sand.”

We stood there until the light faded, two foreigners on a southern wall, both bound to a king who trusted us enough to let us build his teeth and distrusted us enough never to look away for long.

Travancore was changing.

So was I.

The Deccan rider who had washed up on this coast had never imagined he would spend years teaching men how to drill, arguing over stone angles with a Dutchman, and worrying about grain ledgers.

Yet when I watched a new unit march past in neat order, muskets on their shoulders, eyes forward, I felt something like pride.

Not in the idea of a perfect army. There is no such thing. But in the knowledge that somewhere, in some future battle, a Dutchman or a Portuguese or a Mysorean would stand, baffled, as men from this small kingdom refused to die in the patterns their manuals predicted.

That was enough for now.
