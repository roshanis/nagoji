# Book III, Chapter 16: Building a New Army

The horse died on the third day of the fever.

I had bought him from a Tamil trader, a grey with a black mane, not as fine as the mount I had lost in the storm, but steady, patient, willing to learn the sand. I had named him Megha, for the monsoon clouds he reminded me of.

When he would not rise that morning, I knew. I sat with him in the stable while the grooms kept their distance, watching his flanks heave, feeling his neck grow cold under my hand. He did not struggle at the end. He simply stopped, the way a lamp runs out of oil.

I buried him myself, on the hill behind Padmini Amma's estate, in the shade of a tamarind tree. The ground was hard. It took hours. By the time I finished, my hands were blistered and the sun was setting.

Dhanaji found me there, staring at the mound of red earth.

“He was a good horse,” he said.

“He was mine,” I said. “The first thing I owned in this land that I chose myself.”

We stood in silence. Below us, the lights of the training ground flickered where the evening drill was beginning without me.

“How long have we been here?” I asked.

Dhanaji counted on his fingers. “Four monsoons since we washed up on this coast.”

Time after a battle does not move in days. It moves in drills.

You look up one morning and realise that the men who had never seen a European volley a season ago now curse when a recruit fumbles his priming. You notice that the boys in the kalari have grown into broad-shouldered youths who no longer look over their shoulders for approval before they strike. You find grey at your temples that you do not remember earning.

That was how I measured time after Colachel.

In the first weeks after the battle, before drills ground the days into one long line, I lay under the jackfruit tree at Padmini Amma's estate with my ribs bound tight and my head full of surf and smoke.

Revathi came twice.

The first time was on the pretext of speaking with Padmini about grain and widows' stipends. When Padmini left us with a pot of buttermilk and a warning not to bleed on her courtyard, Revathi sat on the low wall near my feet, her eyes on the sky.

“You look worse than the Dutch,” she said. “At least they had the sense to collapse on sand, not good stone.”

“Sand is softer,” I said. “Stone holds the bruise longer.”

She clicked her tongue and reached for the bandage at my side.

“Who wrapped this?” she asked.

“A Maratha who has tied more saddle girths than ribs,” I said.

She undid the cloth with quick, efficient fingers, ignoring my hiss when the air touched the raw skin, then wound it again, tighter and neater.

“This kingdom keeps trying to turn you into ash,” she murmured. “Do not give it all of you at once.”

I wanted to tell her that part of me had already burnt on that beach and in the letters I had not yet written north. Instead, I said, “I promised your Nagas I would bleed on their earth. I did not promise how much.”

She tied off the bandage and sat back.

“Learn to keep a little for yourself,” she said. “And for those who will have to live with whatever is left.”

Then she rose and called for Padmini, business returning to her face like a veil.

The second time, she came alone.

It was past midnight. The household had gone to sleep, and I was lying awake in my room, watching the shadows of palm fronds move across the ceiling. My ribs ached. My mind would not stop replaying the moment my cavalry had hit the Dutch square, the sound, the give, the faces.

I heard the door open. No knock. No lamp.

“You are not sleeping,” she said from the darkness.

“Neither are you.”

She crossed the room and sat on the edge of my mat. I could smell jasmine and something else, sandalwood, the kind burned at funerals and temples.

“Padmini told me you wake screaming,” she said. “That you call out names she does not recognize.”

“Padmini talks too much.”

“Padmini loves you,” she said. “That is why she told me.”

We sat in silence. Outside, a night bird called, plaintive and unanswered.

“I lost a husband,” she said quietly. “At the battle of the lagoon, five years before you washed up on this coast. He was a fool who charged when he should have waited. I watched from the walls. I saw his horse go down. I saw what they did to him after.”

Her voice did not waver. She had told this story to herself too many times for it to wound her now.

“For a year, I did not sleep,” she continued. “I would close my eyes and see his face. Not the living face, the other one. The one they left in the mud.”

“How did it stop?” I asked.

“It did not stop,” she said. “I learned to carry it. The way you learn to walk with a stone in your shoe. Eventually, you forget you are limping.”

She reached out and found my hand in the darkness.

“I did not come here to talk about the dead,” she said.

“Why did you come?”

“Because you are alive,” she said. “And so am I. And I am tired of pretending that is not worth something.”

Her fingers traced up my arm, finding the edge of the bandage, then moving past it to the bare skin of my shoulder. I caught her wrist.

“Revathi...”

“There is a room,” she said. “Below the granary. Padmini showed me, years ago. It kept someone alive once, when knives were hunting. No one goes there now. No one will hear.”

“If anyone sees you leave...”

“I am a widow,” she said. “I am not a wife. What I do with my nights is my own concern.”

There was a defiance in her voice, but beneath it, something else. A question. She was giving me the choice to refuse.

I did not refuse.

We moved through the sleeping house like thieves. She knew the way, through the storeroom, past the great clay vessels of rice, to the low wooden door in the corner that looked like nothing more than a repair panel. The cellar beyond was small and dark, smelling of old grain and earth. A single mat had been laid on the floor, and a brass lamp that she lit with a flint she carried.

In that flickering light, she looked at me.

“I have thought about this,” she said. “Since the night you stood in my hall and told me you were not a man who made promises. I have thought about what it would mean to want someone who might die in any season's campaign.”

“And?”

“And I decided that I would rather have one night I chose than a lifetime of nights I did not.”

She reached up and unpinned her hair. It fell past her shoulders, darker than the shadows around us.

What happened next was not the coupling of poems, all moonlight and whispered endearments. It was something rawer, two people who had both learned that the world takes without asking, choosing for once to take something for themselves.

She was careful of my ribs. I was careful of the scars she carried that I could not see. We did not speak of love. We did not need to. The word would have been too small for what moved between us, grief and want and the desperate hunger to feel something other than the weight of the dead.

Afterward, we lay on the mat in the lamplight, her head on my shoulder, her breath warm against my neck.

“Padmini will know,” I said.

“Padmini knew before I did,” she replied. “Why do you think she showed me this room?”

I laughed, then winced as my ribs protested.

“That woman sees too much.”

“She sees what she needs to see,” Revathi said. “And she decides what to remember.”

She propped herself up on one elbow and looked at me.

“This changes nothing,” she said. “You are still a mercenary with no name and no house. I am still a princess with a dead husband and a living reputation to protect. In the morning, I will leave before the servants wake. We will not speak of this in daylight.”

“And the next time?”

She smiled, a small, private thing that I had never seen her wear in public.

“The next time,” she said, “you will have to earn.”

She rose, dressed in the darkness with the efficiency of a woman who had learned not to linger, and was gone before the first birds began to call.

I lay in that hidden room until dawn crept through the cracks in the door. The lamp had burned out. The smell of her lingered on the mat, on my skin.

Something had shifted. Not the world, the world remained indifferent to the small hungers of two people in a cellar. But something in me. A door I had kept barred since Keshavrao drowned, since my family faded into letters that grew shorter each year.

I was still a man with no home. But for the first time since I had washed up on this coast, I was a man who wanted one.

Before any of us returned to drill, the king went to settle a debt with his god.

We rode north to Tiruvattar, to the Adi Kesava Perumal temple where the river runs clear over black stone and the air smells of wet moss and ghee lamps. Varma went in barefoot, no crown, only a white cloth and the bandage on his shoulder still stiff from Colachel. He laid gold and pepper at the inner shrine, a *kanikka* offering for a victory he believed had been granted as much by Padmanabha as by powder. When he rose, the Chief Priest brought out a long sword from the sanctum and placed it in his hands, the royal blade the deity is said to lend to kings who defend this land.

On the ride back, he carried that sword across his knees as if it were a living thing. I had seen him ruthless in war, cunning in council, tender once or twice with a child. I had never seen him so certain. The work that followed felt like it marched behind that steel.

After that, the drills began in earnest.

In drills. In walls. In the sound of muskets fired in rhythm on fields where once only temple drums echoed.

Lannoy chose to stay.

At sunrise, the morning after his interrogation, he came before the king again. His hands were unbound this time, though guards still stood near.

“I will serve,” he said in Portuguese, voice flat but clear. “Under your conditions.”

Marthanda Varma inclined his head slowly.

“Then you are no longer a prisoner,” he said. “You are an officer. We will see what kind.”

From that day, the work changed.

Walls that had been patched with whatever stone was at hand were stripped and rebuilt according to new designs. Bastions took on an angular, European look, jutting out like clenched fists. Firing steps were cut with careful calculations of height and angle. Old cannons were remounted, new ones cast or bought. Udayagiri’s granite belly was thickened and braced, and the older fort at Kalkulam was rebuilt on the same star lines, then renamed Padmanabhapuram Fort so the capital would never be without teeth again.

The first time I climbed one of those finished walls and looked down, my stomach did a small, unfamiliar twist. Deccan forts I had grown up with were proud, vertical things. They rose from crags like stacked fists, their lines clean, their corners square, their strength drawn as much from the hill beneath as from the stone above. You could ride up to such a fort, look at it, and know where its teeth sat and where its blind spots lay. Lannoy's designs were different. From above, the fort no longer looked like a box or a ring. It looked like a jagged flower or a star, each bastion thrust out at an angle so that every length of wall could be watched and raked by fire from another. There were no safe shadows at the base now, no stretch of stone that did not lie under some slit or parapet. Even the height felt strange. The walls were lower and thicker than the tall, showy ramparts of my childhood, built not to impress riders like me, but to swallow cannon shot and spit it aside.

Lannoy walked those walls with the same restrained intensity he had once given to Dutch decks. He sketched on palm leaves and bits of paper, muttering to himself, then turned to Travancore masons and carpenters and explained with gestures when words failed.

“If you make this parapet straight, a cannonball that hits it will punch through,” he said once, tapping a line in the clay. “If you slope it, the ball glances off. You save stone. You save men.”

The mason, a squat man with arms like tree trunks, squinted at the sketch, then at the old wall.

“Angled seems more difficult,” he said. “Stone likes to sit square.”

“So do men,” Lannoy replied. “We will teach them both new habits.”

He did not work alone.

I found myself increasingly at his side, not because we liked each other, but because Ramayyan liked the results when we were forced to share space.

In the mornings, Lannoy drilled musketeers and cannon crews.

“Again,” he would say, not raising his voice, but sharpening it. “Prime, load, aim, fire. Faster. Together. The ball does not care whose fingers poured the powder if the timing is wrong.”

He taught them to aim low, to fire not at banners or faces, but at belts, where a shot might tear through more than one man. He taught them to conserve powder in the wet season, to keep their matchcord dry, to clean their barrels with care.

In the afternoons, I drilled horse.

“Again,” I would say, sometimes in the same tone without meaning to. “Circle, feint, scatter, reform. Feel the sand. Trust the man at your side to see the gap you missed.”

I taught them to ride not as independent heroes, but as parts of a moving shape. I taught them that the first volley is not the end of the world, that horses can be taught not to bolt at the sound of muskets if handled calmly.

Sometimes our drills overlapped.

On those days, Lannoy and I stood together on the edge of the training ground, watching as musketeers fired and horse swept across their front at calculated distances.

“In Flanders, we would never expose our men like this,” he said once, shaking his head as a line of Travancore infantry fired over the heads of a passing cavalry unit. “Too much risk of friendly fire.”

“In Flanders, you fight on flat ground,” I said. “Here, your men will have Nairs screaming in their ears and sand in their teeth. Better they learn now how to keep their hands steady when hooves thunder near.”

He made a noncommittal sound, then adjusted a recruit's stance with a quick touch.

“Thumb here,” he said in broken Malayalam. “If you put it there, the recoil will break it. Then you cannot pull the trigger again.”

The recruit winced, nodded, corrected himself.

We argued often.

“Your cavalry should form in deeper blocks,” he said one day, tracing rectangles with his boot in the dust. “Two or three ranks. Their weight will punch through any line.”

“And present a thicker target for cannon,” I replied. “Our horses are not war machines that regenerate overnight. We cannot afford to lose them in piles for the satisfaction of seeing one dramatic impact.”

“Shock matters,” he insisted.

“So does survival,” I said. “These men have fields to return to when the wet season comes. If you burn them all in one summer, who will plant your pepper?”

He glared, then sighed.

“You are stubborn,” he said.

“You are surprised?” I asked.

He laughed, short and sharp.

“No,” he said. “You are a horseman. I would worry if you were not.”

The men watched these exchanges with a mixture of amusement and wariness.

For them, we represented two very different kinds of foreignness.

I was the Deccan outsider, with my Maratha tongue and my stories of forts in dry hills. Lannoy was the pale-haired European, with his long nose and his talk of places with names like Zeeland and Flanders. We both spoke with the king's backing. We both shouted at them when drills went badly. We both bled with them when things went wrong.

Ramayyan hovered at the edge of our shared work, occasionally stepping in to smooth a quarrel, more often simply watching.

“You pull in different directions,” he said once, when Lannoy and I had nearly come to blows over the placement of a new redoubt. “Good. That keeps the fort from rolling down the hill in one piece.”

“We could build two forts,” I muttered. “One for each of us.”

“We cannot feed two,” he replied. “Learn to share walls.”

The king did not attend every drill. He did not need to. His presence was felt anyway.

When he did appear, he watched quietly, saying little. A slight tightening of his jaw at a sloppy volley, a small nod at a clean charge, a brief word to a captain whose unit had improved, all of these carried more weight than a dozen shouted orders.

He also rode out to inspect the new forts that rose along the northern marches.

“We will not wait for the Dutch to bring their friends here,” he said, standing on a newly built bastion overlooking a narrow pass. “We have other enemies in this land. The Mysore men. The old chiefs who resent my line. The Tamil, Arcot, if they decide to ride south. This army is not only for white men.”

His gaze slid to me when he said Tamil.

A few days after one such inspection, he appeared at the drill ground with a bundle of cloth over his arm.

“If we are to face them,” he said, glancing toward the distant line of the sea where Dutch hulls rode, “let them see that we can stand in their order as well as our own.”

Lannoy unfolded short coats of rough blue cloth and stiff felt hats in the company style. The men muttered as the pile grew. So did I.

“We are not Dutch,” I said later, low enough that only Lannoy heard. “I will not dress like one of your ledgers on legs.”

“Cloth does not decide who you serve,” he replied. “These coats make your men look like one body. They make European eyes see an army, not a crowd. Wear them when the Maharaja asks. Throw them aside when you ride home.” He looked at our infantry, bare-chested, dhotis hitched, muskets on shoulders. “If a captain in Amsterdam sees a sketch of blue jackets and straight lines, he will think twice before sending a few more men as if they marched into a market.”

I hated that he was right.

The next time the drums beat and the king came to watch, a line of Nair and Arcot infantry stood in those blue coats, hats stiff on their heads, muskets at the same angle. I sat my horse behind them, the collar tight at my throat, the felt hot and unfamiliar above my scars. Some of the men grinned when they saw me in that foreign cloth, but they straightened all the same.

For a few breaths, from a distance, the line might almost have been one of the neat formations I had once ridden against. Then the order broke, coats were shrugged open, dhotis loosened, and the smell of sweat and river mud reclaimed the field. The cloth was only another tool. The men inside it were still ours.

Travancore's shape changed under this work.

Villages that had once sent men only when summoned now saw their sons marching in regular drills on designated days. Chiefs who had kept small private bands of fighters began to send those men to be integrated into company-sized units under the king's officers. The old, loose patchwork of levies and personal retainers slowly rewove itself into something tighter.

Not everyone liked it.

In some houses, older men grumbled that the Maharaja was taking their traditional rights. In others, younger men welcomed the chance to rise through a system that recognised skill more than birth.

Padmini Amma navigated these shifts with her usual blend of sharp tongue and practical adjustment.

“You will send ten men to the new fort,” she told one reluctant kinsman. “You will also send grain. In return, when raiders come from the north, those cannons will not ask whether your house paid its proper share before they fire. This is how a kingdom works, cousin. Not like your grandfather's time.”

Revathi watched with a more complicated gaze.

At Velinadu, she attended some of the new musters, her eyes following the lines of men, the shapes of formations, the flags that flew above them.

“Your king buys loyalty with guns,” she said to me once as we watched a mixed unit of Nair and Arcot infantry fire in turn. “It is an expensive currency. When the guns rust, what will hold them?”

“Habit,” I said. “Fear. Pride.”

“Habit breaks,” she said. “Fear changes its object. Pride is a fire that burns houses as easily as enemy camps.”

She was not wrong.

But as I watched a line of young recruits bring their muskets to their shoulders in a smooth movement that would have been unthinkable three years earlier, I could not deny the power of what we were building.

A state that could kill Europeans.

A state that could, in time, kill men who looked like me, if the map shifted.

In quieter moments, alone under the jackfruit tree or on the fort wall at dusk, I thought of my village near Nashik. Of my brother walking the fields. Of my parents' hair turning white. Of Deccan forts that may or may not have heard of a small southern battle called Colachel.

“You could go back,” Dhanaji said one evening as we watched Lannoy's men practice loading drills by lamplight. “You have earned the right. The king would not stop you. He might even send a letter to Peshwa saying you fought well.”

“And then what?” I asked. “I arrive as a man who has seen how a small kingdom built for war thinks. They will either treat me as a curiosity or try to use me against this land. Either way, I will find myself in another man's web. At least here I know the strands.”

He grunted.

“You speak as if you are resigned,” he said.

“I speak as if I have counted,” I replied. “And found fewer deaths in this column than in the others.”

He laughed, shaking his head.

“Always counting,” he said.

“It is what I know how to do,” I said.

One evening, after a long day of drills, Lannoy and I found ourselves standing alone on a bastion above the inlet where Marakkar boats moved like dark insects.

For a time we said nothing. The sky was the colour of old pewter, the water below catching and breaking what little light remained.

“When I was a boy,” he said suddenly, without preamble, “I dreamed of building fortresses on foreign shores. In school we drew maps and imagined walls that would project our power into strange lands. It was all lines and angles. None of us drew the people who would live behind those walls.”

He gestured toward the fort under our feet.

“Now I build them for a king who once tried to kill me,” he said. “Life has a sense of humour.”

“You are paid,” I said.

“So are carpenters,” he replied. “They do not always get to choose which houses their beams hold up.”

He looked at me.

“My mother writes that the company priests tell her to pray for my soul,” he added quietly. “She lights candles for a son who is either dead or damned, depending on which story they tell that week. I do not know which pains her less.”

The admission hung between us, more intimate than any talk of angles.

“Do you ever regret staying?” he asked.

I thought of Goa. Of the storm. Of Keshavrao's hand slipping from the rope. Of the first time Marthanda Varma offered me a place.

“Regret” I said. “No. Question, yes. Often.”

“That is something,” he said.

A few weeks later, at Udayagiri, someone tried to answer those questions for us.

We were walking the new rampart line there at dusk, arguing over whether a particular angle gave enough overlapping fire, when a musket cracked from the scrub beyond the outer ditch. The sound came with the flat, hard snap of powder close to hand, not the distant thud of a practice shot.

The ball sang past Lannoy's head, close enough that I heard it clip a loose strand of his hair. Another shot followed a heartbeat later, then a third, both low and hurried. Stone chipped from the parapet near my knee.

“Down,” I snarled, dragging him with me behind the bastion's lip.

Below, our sentries shouted and scattered, muskets snatched up, eyes searching the scrub and rocky outcrops beyond the ditch. Dogs barked. A whistle blew. Somewhere in the gathering dark, feet pounded briefly, then faded.

By the time a search party reached the far bank, whoever had fired was gone. They found only three spent cartridges, trampled grass and the faint, sour smell of someone who had sweated fear and anger in equal measure.

“Not our men,” Ramayyan said later, when reports came in. “Our guards do not waste powder taking potshots at their own fort. Dutch agents, perhaps. Or some Cochin fool who thinks that if De Lannoy dies, the company will pat his head. It pleases me that they aimed badly. It troubles me that they aimed at all.”

Lannoy had gone very still when the first ball passed his ear. Afterward, in the lamplight of the guardroom, he looked at the chipped stone on the parapet and said only, “They will try again, in other ways.”

For me, the musket marks at Udayagiri became one more line in the ledger of storms we now lived under. Not all of them came from the sea.

The next morning the king sent for us. He listened to Ramayyan’s report, eyes flat, then turned to two Nair soldiers from his own household, men with scarred forearms and the quiet gait of temple guards.

“You will walk with Kappithan Lannoy,” he told them. “You will walk with Sawant. Wherever they go, you are their shadow.” It was protection, yes. It was also a reminder. No weapon in this kingdom is left without a hand on its hilt.

For a little while, another thought gnawed at me.

Revathi had spoken more than once of how dangerous it was to let a foreign officer build teeth into this coast, how easy it would be, if a wall ever fell, to let it land on the man who had drawn its lines. Velinadu had eyes and ears in more places than I could count. It would not have been hard for someone who shared her hatred of European arrogance to whisper a path to a hired musket.

The idea tasted wrong even as it formed. She had never been a woman who hid behind bush and ditch. If she wanted De Lannoy humbled or gone, she would say it in a hall where everyone could hear, not send a nervous shooter to scratch stone at his ear. I held on to that, the way a man in a storm holds on to one known star. Love is a poor shield against suspicion, but it is more stubborn than fear.

Below, a cannon boomed, part of a test. The sound rolled out over the water, startling birds from the trees.

“They will come back,” Lannoy said softly. “My old masters. In some form. They do not like being told no.”

“Then we will have walls ready for them,” I said.

He nodded.

“And guns,” he added. “And horse. And men who know how to move on sand.”

We stood there until the light faded, two foreigners on a southern wall, both bound to a king who trusted us enough to let us build his teeth and distrusted us enough never to look away for long.

Travancore was changing.

So was I.

The Deccan rider who had washed up on this coast had never imagined he would spend years teaching men how to drill, arguing over stone angles with a Dutchman, and worrying about supply tallies.

Yet when I watched a new unit march past in neat order, muskets on their shoulders, eyes forward, I felt something like pride.

Not in the idea of a perfect army. There is no such thing. But in the knowledge that somewhere, in some future battle, a Dutchman or a Portuguese or a Mysorean would stand, baffled, as men from this small kingdom refused to die in the patterns their manuals predicted.

That was enough for now.
