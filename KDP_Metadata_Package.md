## One-Line Hook

A Maratha cavalryman survives a Portuguese dungeon and washes ashore in Travancore, only to become the weapon a rising king needs to break the Dutch and forge a southern empire.

## Description (Retail Blurb)

They break him in a Portuguese cellar under Goa, nail by nail, question by question, until his name feels like a lie.

Nagoji Sawant was *huzurat* cavalry under Chimaji Appa, a rider sworn to drive foreigners from the Konkan coast. Captured at the edge of victory, he is shipped south in chains. A storm tears the vessel apart. He lives.

He does not wash up in safety. He washes up on the pepper coast, where every kingdom is a bargain and every bargain is backed by steel. In Venad, the ambitious king Marthanda Varma is crushing rival houses and dragging small polities into a single state. The Dutch East India Company wants that state divided. Cochin and northern powers want it stopped. The sea is full of flags that smell of monopoly.

Pulled into court as a useful stranger, Nagoji is set to train horsemen for a war no one can afford to lose. As alliances tighten and old grudges ignite, the decisive clash comes at Colachel, where sand, smoke, and discipline decide whether Europeans can be humbled on an Indian beach.

Horse of the Servant is the first instalment of Blood and Thrones, a visceral work of historical fiction about loyalty, statecraft, and the price a kingdom pays to become untouchable.
