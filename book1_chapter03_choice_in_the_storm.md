# Book I, Chapter 3: The Choice in the Storm

The first warning was not the shout of a sailor or the crack of thunder. It was the change in the way the ship moved.

Even in chains I had learned the rhythm of this hull. She rolled and heaved with a certain patience, rising over long swells and settling again, her creaks and groans almost like a breathing beast. One night, as the air in the hold grew thick and hot, that rhythm snapped.

The roll sharpened. The floor under us tilted harder to one side, then the other, so that our chains jerked and bodies slid against one another. A few men cursed. One began to retch. Above, heavy boots thudded across the deck with new urgency.

“Storm,” Keshavrao whispered.

I let the word hang and listened. Ships speak when they are in trouble. The strain of timbers changes. The voices of the men who serve them shift from boredom and casual insult to clipped orders.

Now those voices were raised. Portuguese words rattled overhead, sharp and fast.

“Reef the sails... haul, haul... tie that down... move, you son of a dog...”

Then, farther off, a deep boom rolled across the water. Not a cannon, but thunder, the long growl of a sky gathering its strength.

The hatch above us slammed open. Rain hammered down in a sheet for a heartbeat before a canvas awning was dragged into place. Grey light poured into the hold, turning the filth on the floor into a glistening smear.

A guard appeared at the top of the ladder, bracing himself with one hand on the frame, the other gripping a musket.

“Quiet down there,” he shouted in Konkani. “No shouting. No prayers. If any of you break your chains and try for the deck we put a ball in your gut and throw you over.”

No one laughed at his bravado. It is easy to make threats on solid ground. At sea, when the hull itself complains under your feet, every man knows he is at the mercy of things greater than muskets.

The ship lurched again, harder. Men cried out as they slammed into each other, iron biting into ankles and wrists. The guard swore, lost his balance, and disappeared from the square of light. His musket clattered down the ladder and landed not far from me, spinning on the boards before coming to rest against a beam.

For an instant the hold went very still.

Muskets are like horses. They draw every eye in a space. Even men who have never fired one recognise the shape of power.

Then the hull heaved once more. Someone shouted. A chain yanked tight. The spell broke.

“Leave it,” another guard bellowed from above. “Get back to work. The pigs below are not our problem if the mast goes.”

The musket lay between us and the ladder like something washed up by a strange tide. Too far to reach. Too close to ignore.

“Sahib,” Keshavrao murmured, “if the ship breaks...”

“If the ship breaks,” I said, “no musket will save them.”

Water began to seep along the floor, first as a thin trickle, then in thicker threads that followed the slope of the boards. The air grew colder as wind forced itself into the seams. The smell of the sea, sharp and raw, fought with the stink of the hold.

The storm did not descend at once; it built in layers. First the tilt of the deck, then the drum of rain, then the cracks of closer thunder. Only when the first real wave hit us broadside did the men in the hold understand what it meant.

The ship rolled so violently that for a few heartbeats we were almost weightless. Stomachs lurched. Chains snapped taut, then slackened. Bodies slammed into wood and into each other. Somewhere to my left a man screamed as his arm bent under another's weight at the wrong angle.

Cold water surged across the floor, soaking my legs to the knee.

“Hold to the beams,” I shouted in Marathi. “Hook your arms over the wood above. Do not let the chain drag you.”

It was useless advice for some. The space was too tight, the iron too confining. Still, a few men nearest me copied my movement, looping their forearms over the rough timber above their heads whenever the ship lurched, taking some strain off their wrists and ankles.

Keshavrao tried and nearly lost his grip as another wave hit. I grabbed his forearm and steadied him, the iron between us clanging.

“Listen to me,” I said, pitching my voice low and close. “Storms break ships. When wood breaks, iron bolts pull out. Chains go loose. The men above will think only of their own skins. In that chaos there will be one moment when we can move without them seeing.”

His eyes were wide in the gloom. “Move where?”

“Towards air,” I said. “Towards anything that floats.”

Another crash of water. The hull groaned like an animal in pain.

“And if there is no such thing?” he asked.

“Then we die here in the dark,” I said. “You have seen the dungeon. That is what awaits us at the end of this journey in another land. Tell me which death you prefer.”

He swallowed. His Adam's apple bobbed against his collar.

“With you,” he said, “I prefer the one that involves a chance.”

The storm grew teeth.

Soon there was no rhythm left in the ship, only violent, unpredictable lurches. The world narrowed to wood, iron, cold and noise. Lightning flashed through gaps around the hatch cover, turning the hold into brief, harsh portraits of fear. Men clung to each other, to beams, to whatever they could find.

Above, voices rose in panic.

“The mainmast... hold her steady... cut the rope... it will take us over...”

A new sound joined the rest, a long, splintering crack that vibrated through the hull. The ship shuddered as if struck by a giant hand. Something heavy crashed on the deck above. More shouting, this time with the edge of terror men do not bother to hide.

“She is taking water... pump, for the love of God...”

Water poured into the hold in earnest now, not in thin sheets but in surges that smacked into our legs and bellies. The cold stole breath. Chains grew heavier as they dragged through the flood.

“We will drown down here,” someone gasped.

He was right. If the ship sank with us still chained to the beams, the sea would fill our mouths before we even reached the surface.

“Look,” Keshavrao shouted in my ear. “The ring.”

He jerked his chin toward the iron ring that held the chain above our heads. It was bolted into a beam with thick nails, but with each violent roll the wood around it creaked and splintered a little more. Dark cracks spread around the bolt, widening as the hull flexed.

“When it goes,” I said, “we move.”

We did not have to wait long.

Another wave hit. The ship climbed, shuddered, then seemed to fall out from under us. In that sickening drop there was a sound like a tooth being pulled from rotten gum. The ring tore free from the beam with a spray of splinters. The chain that held our section dropped, yanking our collars and wrists, then sagged.

Men screamed, not in pain but in wild, sudden hope.

“Quiet,” I snapped. “You want them to hear?”

The noise above would hide a great deal, but panic makes men loud. Loud men attract attention.

I wriggled my hands as far as they would go along the slackened chain, bringing my wrists closer to the bolt hole in the beam. The wood there was ragged and soft. With enough force, perhaps the iron could be slipped, not from the cuffs themselves, but from the weakened timber.

“Help me,” I said to Keshavrao. “On three. Pull as if you are trying to tear your own head off. One, two...”

On three we both jerked backwards, putting all our remaining strength into the chain. Muscles screamed. The edges of the collars bit into our necks. For a moment nothing moved. Then the rotten wood gave another fraction, the hole widening.

“Again,” I hissed.

We pulled, again and again, timing our efforts with the wildest rolls of the ship. On the fourth attempt the bolt tore free entirely. The length of chain that linked our collars dropped to the floor with a splash.

We stumbled, suddenly unmoored. Our wrists were still shackled, our ankles still chained in pairs, but for the first time since Goa there was open space above our heads.

“Others,” Keshavrao said.

I nodded. “Quickly.”

We moved along the beam as far as our ankle chains allowed, grabbing at iron, yanking at rings, kicking at weak points in the wood. Some prisoners were too far away for us to reach. Others had rings buried in sound timber that would not yield. In a few compartments we were able to free the line that held the collars, giving those men the same fraction of liberty we now possessed.

Liberty was a generous word. We were still in a dark box, chained at wrists and ankles, with a storm trying to tear the world apart above us. Yet the feel of slack iron at our throats did something to the spine that torture had not. It made men stand a little straighter, even with the deck pitching underfoot.

“The hatch,” I said. “We need air. We need to see.”

The ladder swayed with every lurch. The fallen musket still lay at its foot, water washing around it in little currents.

“If we take it,” Keshavrao said, “they will shoot us.”

“If we stay,” I said, “we may drown before they can load.”

I sloshed forward, every step a battle against the water and the drag of the chains. My fingers closed around the stock of the musket. It was not loaded. Sensible men do not leave a primed weapon lying about. Still, weight is weight, and a length of hardwood with a metal barrel can break a wrist or a skull more cleanly than bare hands.

“Stay behind me,” I told Keshavrao.

I began to climb.

The ladder felt narrower than any siege stair I had ever mounted. My shackled ankles limited my stride. The musket bumped against the rungs as I went. Around me the hull creaked and shuddered. Water slapped the underside of the deck in heavy blows.

Halfway up a figure appeared in the square of light, backlit by a flash of lightning. For an instant he was only a silhouette, musket in hand.

“Back,” he shouted, the word broken by fear and the tilt of the world. “Back, or I fire.”

He tried to bring the barrel down toward me. The ship chose that moment to lurch. He flailed for balance, one hand leaving the ladder.

Years of riding into gaps in enemy lines had trained my body to move in such instants before my mind could think.

I drove the butt of my own musket upward with all the force I could muster. It connected with his wrist. Bone cracked. His weapon spun away. He cried out, reaching blindly for support, and missed.

He fell past me, hitting the rungs once, twice, then the floor of the hold with a wet, final sound. The water took him, rolling him against the planks like a piece of discarded cargo.

The ladder was clear.

“Now,” I shouted. “Move. All of you who can climb, move.”

I scrambled the last few steps and burst onto the deck. The hatch opened just aft of the mainmast, near the middle of the ship.

The storm greeted me like an enemy who had been waiting.

Rain hammered down in sheets. Wind ripped at what little cloth I had left. The deck tilted. I grabbed a rope to keep from sliding into the frothing black water below. Above, what remained of the mast loomed at an angle, torn canvas snapping like flags of surrender.

Men fought everywhere. Not each other, but the elements. Sailors wrestled with lines, knives in their teeth, trying to cut away rigging that threatened to drag the ship over. Others pumped at hand levers that fed water from the bilges back to the sea, their faces white in the lightning flashes.

No one looked at me.

To them I was just another piece of loose cargo tossed up from below. Their world had shrunk to ropes, timbers and the next wave.

Behind me, at the hatch by the mast, Keshavrao's head appeared. His eyes were huge in the storm light.

“Sahib,” he cried. The word was whipped away by the wind.

Another wave loomed, higher than the others. It reared up on our starboard side, to my right, a wall of water lit silver for a moment by lightning. For that instant everything was clear.

The broken mast. The men at the pumps. The open sea beyond, white capped and hungry. Keshavrao's thin hands on the ladder. The chain still linking his ankles. The iron still binding his wrists.

A coil of rope lay by the starboard rail at my right, half loose at my feet. A shattered spar floated just off the ship's side, momentarily caught in the eddying water.

Calculations raced through me faster than words. Leap now, reach the spar. Keshavrao follows, chains drag him under. Wait to free him, we both get smashed against the rail.

The wave fell.

It hit the ship with a force that tore screams from every throat. Water crashed over the deck, hammering us flat. For a moment I was nowhere, only a body in a cold, roaring universe. Then the ship lurched up again, and I found myself on my knees, fingers clawed into that coil of rope.

Keshavrao still clung to the hatch, half out of the hold, half in. The water had drenched him, slicking his hair to his skull. Blood ran from somewhere on his forehead, thin in the rain. His right hand still twitched at his side, reaching for a sword that would never come.

“Sahib,” he shouted again. “Do not leave me.”

He had said, in the dark below, that he would follow wherever I jumped.

The storm offered no time for noble speeches now.

I threw one end of the rope toward him. It slapped wetly against the deck, then slipped, the coils sliding toward the scuppers as the ship tilted yet again.

“Tie it,” I yelled. “Around your chest. Quick.”

He fumbled with the rope, fingers clumsy with cold. Another wave loomed. The ship's bow plunged into it. For a moment the world became only grey and white.

The rope went taut in my hands.

For an instant I thought he had managed it, that I could haul him up and over the hatch, that we would stand together on the deck and leap in our own time.

Then I felt the wrong kind of weight on the line. Not a man's body tied with intent, but the dead drag of something pulled by a force greater than any arm. The rope burned across my palm.

The ship dropped. The wave receded. The rope peeled my skin and vanished over the side, whipped away by retreating water.

Keshavrao was gone.

For a heartbeat I stared at the empty hatch, the broken ladder, the absence where his face had been. The rope burns on my palms throbbed, the only proof he had been there at all. The storm did not pause to mark his passing. The next gust tore at the stump of the mast. The next wave reared.

The spar I had seen floated closer, riding the foam just off the rail.

In the Deccan, before we rode into Portuguese fire, my troop and I had made a pact. If a man fell, the others rode on. We would mourn later, in camp, with liquor and song and stories. On the field there was no room for hesitation.

This was my field now.

I wrapped the remaining coil of rope around my chest twice and knotted it as best I could with numb fingers, leaving the free end trailing. It was a poor excuse for a plan, but sometimes the gods look kindly on men who refuse to freeze.

I staggered to the rail.

The sea clawed at the hull. The spar rose on the swell, close enough now that I could see the splinters at one end, the barnacles clinging to its underside.

I took one breath, tasting salt and fear. I thought of Keshavrao's narrow shoulders in the hold, of his quiet “with you, sahib” in the dark.

“Forgive me,” I said, to the boy I promised not to leave, to the horse who died better than I would, to whatever gods listen to men who jump into storms.

Then I hurled myself over the side.

The sea closed over my head like the hand of an angry god.
